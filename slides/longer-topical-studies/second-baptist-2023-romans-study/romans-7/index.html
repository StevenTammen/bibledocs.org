### What is the difference between Jurisdiction and Judgement

### What does the married woman represent in this passage?

### Why would we expect a person married to sin to act as if they are married to the Holy Spirit?

### What must happen before we can surrender to Jesus?

### What does the fruit we bear look like?

### Are we adulterers against Jesus?

### What are are we judged by as believers in Christ?



### If not for God's law, how would we know what sin is?

### If we are not bound by Old Testament Law, then why does Jesus mention it?

See Matthew 5:17-20.



### What is human nature?

### Which nature do you yield to most often?

### Who is the ONLY one that can do good in or through me?

### Why do we fight the new nature given to us at salvation?

### Why does sin win so often?



### When does the battle with sin come to an end?

### How powerful is the call of the flesh in your life?

### "But I am a good person!" Really? Based on what standard?

### Choose this day which master you will serve!
