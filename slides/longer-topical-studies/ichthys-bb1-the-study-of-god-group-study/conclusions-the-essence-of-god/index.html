### An overview in words



God's goodness overflows with love, providing grace for sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says a loving God can't condemn,  
&emsp;He did condemn His Son that we might live,  
&emsp;redeeming us in love with the blood of Christ.

God's holiness overflows in justice, offering mercy to sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says a just God can't forgive,  
&emsp;He did forgive us, by condemning His own Son,  
&emsp;making us righteous through the blood of Christ.

God's faithfulness and truth overflow in life, producing peace with God for sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says that a God of integrity can't restore us,  
&emsp;He did make peace between us through His Son,  
&emsp;reconciling us to Himself and granting us eternal life on the basis of the blood of Christ.
