## Elevator pitch

If I were trying to sell you on this website and only had a couple of minutes, here's how I'd go about it. Many of the things mentioned here in brief are expanded on in greater depth further down on this page. This is intended to be the "summary version" of what value this site brings to the table.

[Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) readers interested in how this site compares to Ichthys should look [here](/links/#ichthys).

### 1. Content-related advantages

#### 1.1 Content focus and methodology

* This site highly prioritizes conciseness, focus, and clarity, making its writings shorter and more to-the-point than many alternatives.
* All writing on this site is completely focused on what the biblical text says and means, and just about nothing else. Wherever scripture leads, that is where this site goes, traditions and popular opinion aside.
* This site does however examine application in depth, with an eye towards making (sometimes) abstract Bible teaching easier to apply. The idea is not to lay down hard-and-fast rules, but to give a good starting point for individual application. Detailed discussions examine potential personal circumstances, identify relevant variables, and include visual flowcharts ([as described below](#the-content-of-these-application-sections)) for exploring routes of application. (The flowcharts are something I haven't seen done elsewhere, even though I think they are typically extremely useful).
* This site offers content at different levels, to make it useful to as wide a group of people as possible.
  * It has different content levels aimed at different levels of spiritual knowledge. There are resources for both new believers and seasoned spiritual veterans.
  * It has different writing levels for different levels of technical complexity and prose difficulty. (The lower level is good for children and non-native English speakers, for example).
* All content is corrected, updated, and enhanced over time, with no lag-time whatsoever. Unlike books that can retain errors and suboptimal content for long periods of time between published updated versions (for example), all writing on this site is *continually* improved and revised.
  * For example, Q&A pages are commonly updated to include new Q&A chains, incrementally growing longer over time.

#### 1.2 Content types

This site offers 10 different content types:

1. [Topical Studies](/topical-studies): in-depth studies, in the manner of longform non-fiction books. 
2. [Pages](/pages): shorter topical pages dedicated to brief but thorough treatments of individual concepts.
3. [Verse-by-verse Studies](/verse-by-verse-studies): in-depth studies, in the manner of an opinionated technical commentary.
4. [Study Notes](/study-notes): more abbreviated notes on scripture, in the manner of a study Bible.
5. [Q&As](/questions-and-answers): questions and answers by topic. Some of these Q&As come from correspondence with site readers, some are from my own correspondence with my teachers and mentors (I'm the one asking questions in these), and finally others (both questions and answers) are completely of my own creation.
6. [Ministry Info](/ministry-info): preparation and ministry information for specific ministries (e.g., apologetics, evangelism, music).
7. [Guides](/guides): video guides on various matters (e.g., using Bible study software).
8. [Study Group Recordings](/study-group-recordings): recording archives of the meetings of a weekly Zoom Bible study group.
9. [Greek Resources](/greek-resources): resources relating to the study of Ancient Greek.
10. [Hebrew Resources](/hebrew-resources): resources relating to the study of Biblical Hebrew.

Breaking up the writing on the site like this makes it easy for readers to find the resources they are interested in. Lack of useful content organization is a major pet peeve of mine, one this site very much tries to avoid.

#### 1.3 Special content sections

This site has clearly distinguished special content sections with specific background colors for different kinds of writing. Marking out content like this is trivially easy on the technical side of things, but has huge benefits. Being able to tell at glance what a section deals with lets readers instantly focus in on and/or avoid specific kinds of content. Here's a list of the special content sections this site makes use of:

1. [Quotes](#quotes) (silver background): writing from sources that is too long to incorporate into the body of the text with quotation marks.
1. [Indirect reasoning](#indirect-reasoning) (blue background): writing discussing matters that we can and should be dogmatic about even though they are not directly addressed in scripture, because scripture addresses other things that are indirectly related.
1. [Application](#application) (green background): writing discussing application of Biblical truths as a function of personal circumstances. The discussion found in these sections is much less black-and-white than all other writing on this site.
1. [Technical discussion](#technical-discussion) (orange background): writing discussing technical matters, such as points of Greek and Hebrew grammar and lexicography, scholarly arguments about textual issues, difficult topics in biblical archaeology, and so forth.
1. [Cautionary notes](#cautionary-notes) (red background): writing focused on heading off false teaching. Cautionary notes also address possible pitfalls and traps in application.

I have not seen this sort of fine-grained content sectioning done on other websites (much less ministry websites), much to my puzzlement. It is very, very useful!

(Note: My longer post-hoc notes in posted Q&A correspondence [use this same concept of sectioning by altered background color](#post-hoc-notes), although this particular case is somewhat semantically distinct from the other sections listed above).

#### 1.4 Webpage ninja-powers (contrast static documents and especially paper resources)

Having content on a website allows for a few very helpful things that simply aren't possible with static documents and especially paper resources. Hyperlinks and JavaScript-backed interactive functionality are beautiful things.

* This site utilizes an interactive table of contents for each content page that allows you to *directly link to all content sections* (being able to directly reference specific parts of pages is incredibly useful), and dynamically updates based upon where you are on the page so that you always have a good idea of your relative position.
* This site has verse tagging that automatically displays scripture when hovering over verse references. Unlike many other implementations of the same feature on other sites, this site, via [the settings page](/settings/#reftagger-control-panel), allows the reader to choose the specific Bible version used as well as show or hide links to [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/).
* Rather than simply citing page numbers in paper reference works (e.g.), this site uses the APIs of Bible software platforms to *directly* link to information within the resources, as best as possible. For example, here's a link to the BDAG lexicon entry for the Greek word κύριος in Logos: [BDAG > κύριος](https://ref.ly/logosres/bdag?hw=%CE%BA%CF%85%CC%81%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82). I [maintain a detailed resource index](/resource-index/#resource-index) listing which resources I own and recommend so that anyone (although especially other teachers) can buy the digital resources I use to *instantly* jump to the materials I reference. People with paper versions can still follow along based on the link text (the procedure I follow in forming this link text is [explained on that same resource index page](http://localhost:1313/resource-index/#linking-to-and-citing-resources)).
* Whenever useful in writings, this site includes lists of links to related content so that readers can instantly find more resources on topics they are interested in. Many of these links to related content will be internal links (i.e., links to other things on this site), but some may also link to resources off-site, especially [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) resources.
* The change history for any page can be viewed by looking at the page's [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) in [the content folder of this site's GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/bibledocs.org/tree/master/content/). This lets one get an idea of how a page has been updated over time.
* In-line with this site's focus on continual improvement, it is very easy for site readers to submit typo corrections and suggest more substantial content improvements. Every content page has a link in the menu sidebar titled "Edit on GitHub" -- after clicking on this link (and creating a GitHub account, if necessary), *anyone* can instantly submit suggested content changes by editing the page's [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).
* Speaking of sidebar links, many pages on this site contain additional convenience links. Based on these links, readers can:
  * Instantly go back and forth between higher and lower writing levels (for all content types that support the two writing levels, which is most of them).
  * Instantly switch between the more in-depth Verse-by-verse Studies and the more condensed Study Notes for a given chapter of scripture.
  * Instantly jump back to the top of the page.
  * Go one page up or one page down. While having links in the sidebar to accomplish this isn't particularly useful when you have access to a keyboard that has PageUp and PageDn keys, when you are on a tablet or a phone, this allows for paginated reading, which is superior to scrolling when reading in-depth rather than skimming. (See more [here](/resource-index/#reading-on-screens)).

### 2. Ministry-level advantages

#### 2.1 Open to questions

This ministry [allows for and encourages reader questions](/#fourth) that ask for clarification on a point of teaching or for elaboration on something that is hard to understand. Being able to to have one-on-one conversations with teachers when needed is a large help, and not to be underestimated.

I personally have benefitted from email correspondence in such a way, having asked the teacher behind [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) many, many dozens of questions over the years. (Ichthys has a similar contact policy). Some of these Q&A chains between myself and the teacher behind Ichthys are posted in the [Q&A section](/questions-and-answers).

#### 2.2 Staying up to date

This ministry allows for multiple different methods of staying up to date with content and site happenings more generally. Of the below options, you can use whichever one(s) work best for you.

* There are comprehensive [RSS feeds](/rss) for all the various subgroupings of content you might want to stay posted on (e.g., for all the different content types). For what it is worth, RSS feeds are how I personally tend to stay up to date with sites I follow.
  * Having separate RSS feeds for different groupings of content (like this site does) is especially useful, as it lets you have a finer-grained approach when tracking new content.
* There is a [mailing list](/#mailing-list) for staying updated about the ministry and wider community.
* Things posted to the mailing list are also put up on the site's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BibleDocs) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BibleDocs) pages at the same time, so that folks can stay updated through whatever channel they are most comfortable with.

#### 2.3 Useful meta pages

This ministry maintains a few high-level pages that enhance the site's usability and functionality:

* [Settings Page](/settings): contains options to change preferred writing level across the site, verse tagging preferences, and so on.
* [Links Page](/links): contains an annotated list of ministries and Bible study resources I recommend, with lots of explanation as to what things are recommended for different groups of people. (Teachers and advanced believers need some resources that many lay Christians do not, for example).
* [Resource Index](/resource-index): contains the exhaustive list of the Bible study resources I personally use, as well as information relating to which Bible software programs I recommend, and how I cite paper resources and link to digital ones using Bible software APIs.
* [Passage Index](/passage-index): contains links to places where I address specific passages in scripture. (Excludes the self-evident links to Verse-by-verse Studies and Study Notes; the links here are to discussion of passages that can be found in the other content types like Topical Studies and Pages).
* [Subject Index](/subject-index): contains links to full pages and subsections of pages on this site, organized by topic.

#### 2.4 Community

While I do not maintain an open online forum or Discord server (for example) -- largely due to the time commitment these things require on my part to "do them right" -- this ministry does have a group of consistent readers and contacts that compose a community of sorts. With this group in mind, this ministry:

* Maintains [an active prayer list](/prayer-list). Most prayer requests are anonymized down to the level of first name, although you can certainly ask that your prayer request(s) be anonymized further. If you want me to add/update/delete a prayer list request, just email me ([steven@bibledocs.org](mailto:steven@bibledocs.org)).
* Maintains [an address book of contacts](/address-book) and their areas of expertise, knowledge, and/or interest. The idea is that I can act as a middleman to put people in contact with each other. Most contacts in the address book will be anonymous, although anyone comfortable being publicly listed in this address book can certainly email me to have more information listed.
* Runs two weekly [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) studies: a study focused on the original languages (Greek and Hebrew alternating weeks) on Saturdays, and a more general Bible study on Sundays. These aren't completely open to the public; you have to get cleared by me (or one of the other study members) to participate. As a rule of thumb, people who are willing to seriously listen and learn are always approved. The screening process is mostly trying to ensure that everyone participating wants to be there (e.g., won't be arguing with every single point), and will take the time seriously.
  * The audience for these studies is global. There are folks from Nigeria and Australia participating, for example. (This does make the time scheduling of our meetings somewhat interesting).
  * I typically clear people I don't know in person via a one-on-one Zoom meeting to get to know them a bit. It's not anything like a test, just a casual chat, so please don't be afraid to reach out. You should be able to know if the groups are likely to be a good fit for you since all the recordings of group meetings [are publicly posted on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFk7khraAKf68DZ5GeYEFIw/playlists).

### 3. Technical advantages

This site has a lot of careful design that has gone into it, making it more attractive in some ways than many other websites.

* Rather simply "not losing functionality" when screen sizes get smaller (i.e., passing the bare minimum threshold of mobile responsiveness), this site takes pains to have the best user experience possible at various smaller screen widths.
  * At mobile phone widths, a bottom bar is added, mimicking the bottom bars that phone operating systems already use. Rather than an unintuitive hamburger menu icon, the buttons to open the menu and page table of contents are clearly labeled.
  * On phone and tablet widths, more padding is added to the table of contents, since it will be actuated by finger presses rather than mouse clicks. Finger presses are much less precise, and it can be a big pain to click on a small (unpadded) link with one's finger.
  * Etc.
* This site takes pains to have dead-simple site navigation in the form of a persistent sidebar with no nesting. While a scrollbar may be necessary depending on your screen's height, the presence of the scrollbar signals to the user "hey, scroll to see more menu links!" This type of menu navigation maximizes clarity, visibility, and "obviousness" -- with the last concept being by far the most important principle in user interface design. Information scent (the idea of "where do I need to click to find...") is maximized without depriving the user of functionality by having too few menu options.
  * You should read [this critique of the so-called "hamburger menu"](https://jamesarcher.me/hamburger-menu) to get a sense of why all of the above is important and makes good design sense.
  * A vertical sidebar menu is used rather than a horizontal menu -- even though either would work about the same in terms of information scent -- because vertical space is more precious than horizontal space for web reading. [The optimal typographical length of lines in text](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability) is narrower than desktop and even many portrait tablet screen widths, so you can see more content at any given point in time if you use a sidebar menu rather than a horizontal menu.
* This entire site is static (built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) and hosted on the fast global content delivery network (CDN) of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Since everything can be cached on global edge nodes, local copies can be sent to site readers across the world with minimal transfer latency. The site is basically as fast as possible, in other words. Don't just take my word for it: go ahead and check this site on website speed testers like [testmysite.io](https://testmysite.io/).
  * Contrast sites that render a new webpage for every new request, like many WordPress sites. Aside from page rendering time, these sites also can't be cached on CDNs as effectively.
* This site's design is lightweight, and attempts to avoid overly heavy resources and frameworks. Even in the cases where only so much minimization can be done, since the entire site is static, local browser caching is very effective, meaning that most heavier files used only need to get loaded a single time anyhow.
  * This consideration is important for folks who have slow connections and/or limited data plans, like many folks in the developing world.

## Sidenote: writings from my personal site

I run another website, my personal website, [StevenTammen.com](https://www.steventammen.com). While this other website is primarily composed of things that do not have much overtly spiritual component, its guiding principles are optimization and efficiency, and making every punch count is certainly a biblical concept:

> (24) Don't you know that all the runners in the stadium run the race, but that only one receives the prize? Run in such a way so as to achieve what you are after. (25) And again, everyone involved in competition exercises self-control in all respects. Those athletes go through such things so that they may receive a perishable crown of victory, but we do it to receive an imperishable one. (26) So as I run this race of ours, I'm heading straight for the finish line; and as I box this bout of ours, I'm making every punch count. (27) I'm "pummeling my body", one might say, bringing myself under strict control so that, after having preached [the gospel] to others, I might not myself be disqualified [from receiving the prize we all seek].
>
> **1 Corinthians 9:24-27**, translation [from Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm#1st Corinthians 9:25-27)

Think about it this way: there are only so many resources (like time, energy, money, and so forth) available to you at any given point in time. The more efficient you are, the more resources you have to spend on things that are actually important, like Bible reading, Bible study, prayer, and ministry more generally.

It is for this reason that I view this other website of mine as part of my service to the Church, even though a lot of the content is not overtly spiritual. I have been fascinated with efficiency for a long time now (I studied industrial engineering, which is all about process efficiency, for a time at Georgia Tech), and have put a lot of thought into things over the years. Readers of this ministry may find the contents of this other website of mine to be helpful. Here's some of the things I write about on this other site:

* Productivity and efficiency (including, notably, the fields of meta-learning, organization, and goal-setting)
* Gear (making wise decisions in regards to purchasing physical products, in order to live lives that effectively balance comfort, minimalism, and frugality)
* Software (making full use of all the capabilities computers have to offer)
* Exercise (boosting mood, energy levels, and metabolism by working out)
* Nutrition (eating a healthy and well-balanced diet to keep our bodies running smoothly)
* Health more generally (strategies for dealing with stress, improving sleep, dealing with mental health challenges, and so on)

<!-- TODO (?): Finances -->

None of these things are any replacement for Bible teaching, but since these topics are relevant to living more generally, my hope is that improvements in these areas can help people sink more resources into spiritual matters.

## A more detailed general overview of this ministry

### Content focus

For this ministry, I have felt led to focus on two main types of things:

1. Basic, introductory teachings.
2. More advanced teachings that are considered "difficult" and "controversial."

#### Introductory teachings

Just as children must learn to walk before they can run, so too must Christians learn "the basics" before they can successfully navigate the complicated and difficult facets of the truth.

Some people might make light of introductory Bible teaching, as if it were just for children. While perhaps there are teaching materials out there that justify a degree of this derision (the sort that whitewash the Bible so that children get the mistaken idea that nobody who dies ever stays dead, for example; teaching children about the resurrection of Jesus and the raising of Lazarus, but not the beheading of John the Baptist or the stoning of Steven), the "introductory" label on this site in no way means that these materials are misleading due to oversimplification or selective attention.

To put things a bit differently, while it is true that these materials are targeted at less advanced Christians, that does not for this reason mean that they are hand-wavy or insubstantial. Rather, the idea is to present an option for learning core essentials of the Christian faith in a no-frills sort of way. If you view the truth in your heart as a structure that is built up brick-by-brick, these essentials would comprise the foundation on which the rest of the structure rests. If you have a faulty foundation -- cracks here, rotting support beams there -- the entire rest of your building is at risk of being compromised. (Compare Matthew 7:24-27).

In the wider context of teaching ministries I recommend, these introductory materials are targeting a level somewhat below even the simplest writings on [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/). The idea is to take new believers from a point of almost complete ignorance of the Bible to the point where they can handle more advanced teaching like that found on Ichthys.

#### Difficult and controversial teachings

After gaining a good foundation in the truth, Christians will be able to handle "solid food" (in the manner of Hebrews 5:12-14). The type of difficult-to-accept and controversial content that I am targeting here, to push the analogy even a bit further, is not the kind of solid food that goes down easily (i.e., teaching that is definitely more advanced, but is neither particularly hard to accept nor controversial -- many parts of Ichthys' [Peter Series](https://ichthys.com/Peter-Series-Home-Page.htm) come to mind), but the kind with bones that get stuck in one's throat on the way down.

The general idea behind this type of content is to cover those things that trip people up and give them trouble more than those things that are clearer and more easily accepted (the "solid food without bones," as it were).

So, for example, this site spends time:

* Teaching that most of the church visible today is in a state of decay and lukewarmness. Contrast this with most modern sensibilities about the state of local churches in America, which tend to be alarmist about the number of young people not showing up to churches on Sunday mornings, while not much questioning the actual spiritual state of said churches.
* Teaching that the church visible (contrast the Church proper with a capital C -- the body of all actual believers on Earth) has been off-the-rails for the majority of its existence. Contrast this with most Christians thinking that while there were periods of poor choices made by Christians throughout history (e.g., the crusades, the inquisition, recurring violence between Catholics and Protestants in Europe, witch hunts, etc.), the church has historically functioned largely as it as it was supposed to.
* Teaching that water baptism was a distinctly Jewish ritual that continued in the transitional period of the Church (as described in the book of Acts) due to the largely Jewish character of the very early Church, but should no longer be practiced by Church-Age Christians, people who have neither temporal proximity nor cultural ties to the Jewish baptism of the John the Baptist. Contrast the opinions of literally all other modern Christians, who, despite never seeming to be able to agree whether or not children should be baptized and whether people must be completely dunked or just sprinkled, are completely united in viewing water baptism as unquestionably important.
* Teaching a doctrine known as the Genesis gap that holds that God blacked out the universe after the rebellion of Satan and his followers between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2, making the creation account in Genesis actually an account of *re*-creation. (Incidentally, this explains the age of the universe, the age of earth, the bulk of the fossil record, and reconciles Ezekiel 28:11ff. with Satan's already-fallen state in Genesis 3). Contrast this with all the other more-common positions on creation, such as day-age theory, 6,000-year-old young earth creationism, theistic evolution, and so forth.
* Teaching a fairly specific chronology of human history that follows a pattern of seven millennial "days" (compare the seven days of creation, and note especially the parallel between God's seventh day of rest and the Millennium described in Revelation), chronology which most controversially identifies the year 2026 as the start date of the tribulation (an eschatological event kicking off the end-times). Contrast this with the view by most modern Christians that "no man knows the day or the hour" (which is actually referring to the second coming of Christ rather than the beginning of the tribulation, but I digress).
* Etc.

While not spending so much time on more advanced Bible teachings that are less controversial or hard to accept. This by no means that such topics will never be covered, simply that they are not so much the focus of this ministry in particular.

### Methodology

#### Focused and to-the-point

The two other Bible teaching ministries I recommend most -- [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) and [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists) -- have teaching that is, on the whole, quite long and technically complex.

While this site too will have its share of longform writings, as much as possible, the content on this site will highly prioritize conciseness, focus, and clarity. The idea is to take away some of the barrier of entry for people who can't handle hundreds of pages of complicated exegesis, hopefully without jeopardizing the integrity of the truth in the process. (The goal is essentially to take away everything that can be taken away, but no more; or, to use a quote oft attributed to Einstein: "everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler").

"Short and simple" is probably a bit misleading as the contents of this site may be neither short nor simple according to certain canons of evaluation, but the idea is to make teaching "short*er* and simpl*er*" -- as much as practically possible without compromising on the truth.

#### Bible centered

All materials on this site are focused on the Biblical text. I mean this in a more or less literal sense: things that the Bible doesn't address I do not either, unless there is relevant [indirect reasoning](#indirect-reasoning) relating to the subject. Bible teaching without biblical support is in truth no such thing!

The only real exception to this otherwise absolute principle is discussion of application, which always depends upon personal circumstances. Since application isn't black-and-white like normal Bible teaching, discussion of application inherently includes more in the way of reasoning and observations that are not ultimately traceable to scripture, and this isn't problematic in this specific context.

This ministry's text-focused approach means that writing on this site will pull in information that is necessary to accurately determine and explain the meaning of scripture while avoiding essentially everything else. Among other things, this means that Bible teaching on the site contains discussions relating to:

* Greek and Hebrew
* Hermeneutics
* Textual criticism
* Ancient history and culture
* Etc.

While avoiding:

* Opinion and conjecture
* Arguments appealing to things other than scripture, like those appealing to famous people, scholarly consensus, centralized church authority, and/or tradition.
* Etc.

#### Application aware

This site attempts to structure its content to make application straightforward. Sometimes a lot of the challenge in the Christian life has less to do with intellectual understanding of the truth, and more to do with figuring out *how* to apply to it to the hugely varied, intensely messy, and inevitably complicated circumstances of life down in the trenches of the spiritual battlefield.

What this means in practice is that the writings of this site will examine potential personal circumstances to identify possible routes of application, as well as relevant variables to consider more generally. Rather than coming up with dogmatic sets of recommendations for given questions of application, this exercise is supposed to jumpstart the personal process that all individual Christians must go through to apply the truth to their own lives.

Discussion of application shows up in specially marked out sections, which you can [read about below](#application).

#### Level appropriate

This site offers different levels of writing on two different measurement scales: spiritual difficulty (compare Hebrews 5:12-14) and technical complexity/prose difficulty (the difference between academic prose and casual conversation, e.g.). I refer to these as "content level" and "writing level," respectively. The goal in offering multiple levels of materials is for the site to be useful to as wide a range of people as possible; by intentionally tailoring the materials it offers to different groups of readers, it is my hope that all will be able to find some things on this site that are a good fit for their present level.

The mechanics of content level and writing level -- and how they interact with the different content types -- are complicated enough that I have below dedicated a whole section to discussing them. Before discussing these levels in more depth, however, it is prudent to talk a bit more about the content types themselves.

## Content types

### Topical studies

The Topical Studies on this site are longform series covering various topics in depth, in the manner of reference books. Their primary purpose is to flesh out areas of particular importance in a systematic way: the Verse-by-verse Studies on this site are of comparable depth, but they are primarily focused on the biblical text, and for that reason lack the systematic approach of the topical studies. Some of the Topical Studies are focused more on doctrine and theology, and some are focused more on application and implementation, but of course the lines are always somewhat blurry.

In many cases, topical studies are an aggregation of shorter pages from the [Pages section](/pages), along with additional content to glue things together. One might ask—why include the actual content of these pages rather than just including links to the pages? The main answer is because it makes uninterrupted reading possible, without having to constantly be juggling tabs and keeping track of where you are in multiple documents. It also makes these studies more useful when they are printed out, which some folks like to do—links don’t work on paper!

### Pages

The Pages section contains brief but thorough treatments of individual concepts, and of all sections on the site, contains the most content. The written content of pages will be updated with improvements and corrections over time (like all writing on this site), making these living documents.

Groups of pages may be collected and glued together with some additional content to form [topical studies](/topical-studies).

### Verse-by-verse studies

The Verse-by-verse Studies on this site provide detailed interpretation, in the manner of an opinionated technical commentary. Their primary purpose is to establish the meaning of the text with a rigorous, step-by-step approach that leaves nothing out, sacrificing a degree of brevity for depth.

<!-- TODO: mention links to Logos, OliveTree, FreeBiblecommentary, etc.) -->

Example button array. Come up with example for Study Notes too.

#### The difference between verse-by-verse studies and study notes

So what is the difference between the Verse-by-verse Studies and Study Notes on this site? The short version is that the Verse-by-verse Studies justify the interpretations presented, while the Study Notes simply assert them. The Verse-by-verse Studies also contain certain things the Study Notes do not: additional in-line resource links (to Greek/Hebrew texts and technical commentaries), helpful notes for intermediate students of Greek/Hebrew (notes not so much focused on establishing meaning as saving time for such students), and an embedded original translation of the text (currently more for the Greek New Testament than the Hebrew Old Testament; my Greek is stronger than my Hebrew).

### Study notes

The Study Notes on this site are notes on the text of the Bible, in the manner of a study Bible. Their primary purpose is to briefly describe the meaning of the text in a no-frills sort of way.

### Questions and answers

The Q&As on this site are dedicated to shorter treatments of various topics, organized in a question and answer format. Some of these Q&As come from correspondence with site readers, some are from my own correspondence with my teachers and mentors (I'm the one asking questions in these), and finally others (both questions and answers) are completely of my own creation.

### Ministry info

The ministry info section on this site is dedicated to providing information relevant to various ministries (such as apologetics, evangelism, music, etc.), in the manner of job handbooks.

### Guides

This section contains pages with embedded video guides on various topics, like using Bible study software. Video makes more sense than text as a medium for guides, but there are still various benefits to having the videos live on pages on my website rather than only showing up on YouTube (see [below](/about-the-site/#why-pages-for-video-guides)).

I highly recommend that if you wish to link to any of my guides, you link to the guide pages on my website rather than directly to the YouTube videos. You can read more about why I recommend such in the above link.

### Study group recordings

I have long run an online Bible study group. This section contains descriptions of the studies we have done over time, with links to the corresponding YouTube playlists. We do not move particularly fast, but we also try to avoid seriously off-topic rabbit trails.

Please note that these videos are posted "as is" and are not corrected or improved over time. For this reason, you should err on the side of trusting the written content on this site more than anything that shows up in the videos. (For a more thorough discussion, see [below](/about-the-site/caveats-with-recordings-of-study-groups)). I am simply offering the video recordings because it costs me very little effort to do so, and some people may find them helpful, even if they are not always perfect.

Currently, the Bible study only contains people I know well, but we are interested in expanding. If you are interested in participating, please email me at [steven@bibledocs.org](mailto:steven@bibledocs.org).

### Greek resources

This section contains pages pertaining to the study of Ancient Greek, particularly the Greek of the New Testament and its time.

Some pages may link to videos from a Greek study group that I run (if discussion in the video is relevant to the page), and some of these videos, in turn, may link to pages on the site. In general, I would recommend focusing on the written content on the pages, as it will always be kept up to date, whereas the videos will not ever receive changes or corrections over time. (For a more thorough discussion, see [below](/about-the-site/caveats-with-recordings-of-study-groups)). I am simply offering the video recordings because it costs me very little effort to do so, and some people may find them helpful, even if they are not always perfect.

### Hebrew resources

This section contains pages pertaining to the study of Biblical Hebrew.

Some pages may link to videos from a Hebrew study group that I run (if discussion in the video is relevant to the page), and some of these videos, in turn, may link to pages on the site. In general, I would recommend focusing on the written content on the pages, as it will always be kept up to date, whereas the videos will not ever receive changes or corrections over time.

## Levels

### Content level

Content on this site is labeled as to its overall spiritual difficulty level, as it seems to me. This sort of labeling is subjective and hand-wavy, it is true, but hopefully it can be at least somewhat useful as a guide. The labeling looks like so:

<ul>
<li><span class="basic">basic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="basic">basic+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="intermediate">intermediate</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="intermediate">intermediate+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="advanced">advanced</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="advanced">advanced+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="mixed">mixed</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
</ul>

The distinction between the bare labels and the "plus versions" (e.g., <span class="basic">basic</span> and <span class="basic">basic+</span>) is the "ease of acceptability / controversy factor" -- things with plus labels are more controversial and/or harder to accept, as it seems to me. It so happens that many of the things that are controversial and/or harder to accept are more advanced teachings, as one might expect. Christians disagree about the basic parameters of the gospel very little, but particulars of eschatological chronology quite a bit, for example.

While this site's writings do run the full spectrum, the two content levels this site focuses on the most are <span class="basic">basic</span> and <span class="advanced">advanced+</span>, as described above in [the section about content focus](#content-focus).

#### Why only three levels of content?

The main reason why I only define and use three content levels is because the lines are so blurry and indistinct. I would be quite uncomfortable breaking things down any more, since fine-grained categorizations would really imply a level of precision that simply isn't there.

Part of this is because different people find different things hard (i.e., my <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span> might be your <span class="basic">basic</span>), so any labels I affix are really my best guesses as to how "most Christians" will relate to the content. The same goes for my decisions about what content I give the plus distinction and what content I do not.

#### What content level(s) should I focus on?

This is a question that is difficult to answer. New believers really should focus on the basics of the gospel and what it means to be Christian (for example), but after that the best order to approach things really becomes something of a personal matter.

More than anything else, figuring out "where you are" is probably best done with some personal experimentation. As a general principle, however, I can recommend following your interests, since interest is a crucial component of effective learning.

### Writing level

This site also tries to account for varied reading levels by offering two levels of writing that are different in terms of technical complexity and prose difficulty.

The higher level of writing on this site:

* Contains [technical discussion sections](#technical-discussion) centering around points of Greek and Hebrew grammar and lexicography, scholarly arguments about textual issues, difficult topics in biblical archaeology, and so forth.
* Has more complicated sentence structure and lots of stylistic variation, with many subordinate clauses, parenthetical statements, and complex flows of ideas.
* Is written formally in a rather high speech register. Perhaps the best way to put is that I actually unironically use words like notwithstanding, moreover, and furthermore.
* Is rather unrestrained in vocabulary usage and usage of foreign borrowings like the Latin phrases *par excellence* and *sine qua non*, the French *raison d'être* and *hors de combat*, and other things like this.
* Does not spend any time defining terms unless doing such is necessary to avoid ambiguity or connotational baggage.

While the lower level of writing on this site:

* Completely omits [technical discussion sections](#technical-discussion), and has a noticeably lower level of technical complexity. Writing glosses over a lot of the details in lieu of simpler explanations: "A Greek word taken by many to mean X actually means Y once you dig into it a bit more. This has Z implications."
* Has much simpler overall sentence structure. Writing contains mostly simple sentences, or two independent clauses joined by "and" or "but". Avoids complex subordinate clauses, lots of parenthetical statements, and other things of this sort.
* Is written informally in a more conversational speech register. This doesn't necessarily mean that the writing isn't rigorous, just that it doesn't sound so academic and stuffy.
* Is noticeably more muted in vocabulary usage and usage of foreign borrowings. Generally tries to avoid less-common and/or longer words and instead use more common and/or shorter words, to bring the overall reading level down.
* Spends more time defining terms rather than taking definitional knowledge for granted.

Even in the higher level of writing, I do try to avoid truly arcane words and academic abbreviations. The idea isn't to write in an overly erudite or scholastic manner, but simply to offer a higher level of writing for those that can handle it.

#### What are the benefits of higher level writing?

The benefits of writing at a lower level are fairly straightforward: more people will be able to make use of the materials (including folks lacking substantial education, children, non-native English speakers, and so on). Even advanced people can make use of materials written at a lower level with simpler sentence structure, vocabulary, and so on. So why not only offer things at a lower level of writing and save the time of keeping up with two different versions for all the content? What does higher level writing get us?

Well, why stop here? Why should English (much less language in general) have multiple words with overlapping meaning? Why even bother with complex sentence structure when we could just use sentences with single independent clauses for everything? Why doesn't everyone just write to the lowest common denominator? After all, this would enable the most people to read and understand the writing.

Here's a couple reasons:

* Higher level writing allows for more specificity, nuance, and subtlety in communication (as mediated by rich vocabulary usage, for example). This is why you will *never* find academic papers written at a low level -- because you "gain communicative power" (in a manner of speaking) from writing at a higher level, as long as your readers have enough education to keep up.
* For people that can handle it, higher level writing is much more engaging and less boring.

This second one is very important. When people's mental faculties are being stretched, they have better directional attention; the important bit is not *over*-stretching one's capabilities. People lacking substantial education, children, and non-native English speakers will have a noticeably lower reading level than an American college graduate at the top of their class, for example. While the former groups of people might need to squint in concentration in reading lower level writing (their minds busy processing more foundational things like basic sentence structure and parts of speech -- especially for non-native English speakers), lower level writing presents little novelty and diversity for well-educated people with a higher reading level. It holds their attention less well than writing with more stylisic variation and rich vocabulary, in other words, and this is an actual problem.

Although not directly related to enhancing the experience of readers, it is also true that I personally write at a higher level by default (that's what being forced to write lots of college papers does to you, I guess). When I am hammering out a draft on something, consciously forcing myself to write at a lower level gets in the way of my flow, at least to a degree. Even if I were to only publicly offer lower level writing on the site, in other words, I'd probably start out writing some higher level form anyhow.

#### Why only two levels, and not more?

Short answer: because maintaining multiple versions of the content takes a lot of time, and the marginal benefit of any additional writing levels after the first two is not worth this time opportunity cost.

Arguably, it might be nice to have higher level writing without technical explanation (instead glossing over the details) and/or lower level writing with technical explanation written at the same lower level (simpler sentence structure, more restrained vocabulary usage, etc.). The reason why these options don't exist is because they aren't nearly as likely to be relevant as the two permutations that are actually used: the people likely to be interested in technical discussion are probably going to have enough education to be able to handle the higher level of writing, and the people reading the lower level of writing probably aren't going to care about technical minutiae.

If time were no factor then I *would* offer even more levels. But time is a factor, so I don't.

#### At which writing level should I read?

There is not really a pat answer to this question, although most people with any degree of higher education should be able to handle the higher level writing on this site without too much trouble. Additionally, if you know you want to get into the nitty-gritty technical details, those only show up in the higher level writing (although all technical discussion is marked out in [special content sections](#special-content-sections) so is easy to avoid if you aren't interested in it).

While I would tend to steer people without any higher education towards the lower level writing so that dense prose doesn't get in the way of the Bible teaching for them, some of these folks will be just fine reading the higher level writing -- after all, formal education is not everything. The same can be said of children -- some kids read far above the level generally expected of them. Kids learn fast anyhow.

The only real hard recommendation I can make is that non-native English speakers stick with the lower writing level until they are quite confident of their ability. English is a very difficult second-language because of its large vocabulary and lack of predictability/consistency.

Just as with [figuring out what content level(s) to focus on](#what-content-level-s-should-i-focus-on), personal experimentation is a good idea.

### How the levels interact with the site's content types

Here is a brief overview of how the levels interact with all of this site's primary content types:

|                             | Content Level                    | Writing Level |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Topical Studies             | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Pages                       | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Verse-by-verse Studies      | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Study Notes                 | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Q&As: Self-Generated        | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Q&As: Reader Correspondence | Typically mixed                  | Higher        |
| Q&As: Mentor Correspondence | Typically advanced or advanced+  | Higher        |
| Ministry Info               | Typically intermediate           | Both          |
| Guides                      | N/A                              | Lower         |
| Study Group Recordings      | Typically mixed                  | Higher        |
| Greek Resources             | N/A                              | Higher        |
| Hebrew Resources            | N/A                              | Higher        |

Some general notes about the table:

* Pages from the content types in the table above that have a content level of “Any of the levels” can be of any of the content levels, from <span class="basic">basic</span> all the way through <span class="advanced">advanced+</span>.
* Pages from the content types in the table above that have a writing level of “Both” are offered with both a higher level version of the page and a lower level version of the page.

Some notes specific to various content types:

* While writings in the categories of Topical Studies and Pages can end occasionally up with a content level of <span class="mixed">mixed</span>, this is not particularly common.
* Verse-by-verse Studies and Study Notes are organized chapter-by-chapter on this site, and the content levels here will thus be guided by how "hard" chapters are, as it seems to me. So, for example, James 2 is given a higher content level than narrative chapters within the gospels. The content level for any given chapter of the Bible will be the same across the Verse-by-verse Studies and the Study Notes.
* The three subtypes of Q&As all behave a bit differently. Q&As that are completely generated by me behave in essentially the same way as Pages. The other two Q&A types that involve actual written exchanges (between site readers and myself, between myself and my mentors) are only offered at a higher writing level to avoid "rewriting history" ([see below](#this-content-is-not-ever-rewritten-at-a-lower-writing-level)). While my correspondence with site readers is often variable in overall spiritual level (why it often ends up labeled as <span class="mixed">mixed</span>), the correspondence I have with my mentors is most commonly about complicated things ((why it often ends up labeled as <span class="advanced">advanced</span> or <span class="advanced">advanced+</span>)).
* Most writings in the category of Ministry Info have a content level of <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span>. Working out the specifics of ministries in general and one's own ministry in particular is not really something for new believers, but it is also not "hard teaching" as far as things go. It's more a question of "of what type am I?" than "how exactly do these things work again?"
* Study Group Recordings typically end up with a content level of <span class="mixed">mixed</span> since the discussion within our Bible study tends to range widely in its level (although I would say it most frequently hovers between <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span> and <span class="advanced">advanced</span>).
* Since Guides are intended to be straightforward and easy to follow, they are only offered in a lower writing level (and there is only one video, rather than two split by presentation level). The reverse is true for Study Group Recordings, Greek Resources and Hebrew Resources: all of these are only offered at a higher writing level (and video level), since the people making use of these resources, as a general rule, will have no use for a lower writing level. In all four cases, not having to maintain two versions of the content ends up saving me a lot of time.
* Writings in the categories of Guides, Greek resources, and Hebrew resources have no content level, as these things are typically not spiritual in nature, *per se*. The guides on this site are primarily focused on practical matters of "how to do X," and the language resources would be at home on any secular University's language department portal (although textual examples are overwhelmingly drawn from the Bible). Links for these content types will therefore not be prefixed with a content level, as they don't have one.

## Special content sections

I take pains to mark out various sections in the writing on this site, according to the contents they contain. There are two big reasons for this practice:

1. Marking out the content sections makes explicit boundaries between types of content. For example, being completely clear in labeling teaching from application is important for ensuring that people don't become dogmatic about things that the Bible does not actually teach as global absolutes (i.e., become dogmatic about things that should be specific to only their particular circumstances).
2. Marking out the content sections makes it very easy to skim writings to find content of a specific type or to avoid content of a specific type when reading. For example, if someone is interested in reading mostly about application, they can look for green sections in the text and quickly skim over the rest. If someone doesn't have a technical background and wants to skip technical discussion (involving matters of Greek, Hebrew, analysis of scholarly positions, and so forth), they can simply scroll through orange sections in the text.

Text that does not fall into any of the content sections (i.e., text without any special background color) should generally be taken to be Bible teaching with direct support from scripture.

You can see examples of each of the content sections below, with Lorem Ipsum text in place of actual content. In the wild, these content sections may end up being quite a bit longer, even containing multiple headers and sub-headers.

### Quotes

{{% quote src="#quotes" text="Source" %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /quote %}}

I find that quoting text in larger blocks (even multiple paragraphs) is often useful. While many formatting procedures indent block-quotes, this ends up wasting a lot of space over the long-term. Changing the background color while otherwise leaving the styling the same is the most practical way to handle longer quotes, and that is exactly what is done here.

The source for a given quote is linked in the label of the section ("Quote from {Source}"). While I do quote from different things at different times, a disproportionately large number of the longer quotes present on this site come from [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/).

### Indirect reasoning

{{% indirect-reasoning %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /indirect-reasoning %}}

Ultimately all Bible teaching needs to be based on scripture. However, this does not mean that all teaching can necessarily point to specific verses that directly prove the point at hand.

For example, the Bible says nothing directly about smoking marijuana. However, the Bible clearly states that we are to submit to government authority (Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17). If the government makes smoking marijuana illegal (as it is in some states in the United States), then it becomes wrong for Christians to do it, even though the Bible never specifically calls it out as wrong. (Additionally, since being drunk and being high are similar in many ways, all the verses condemning drunkenness can also be indirectly applied to smoking marijuana).

As another example, consider the question of arranged marriage. While not common in Western society, there are still areas in the world where it is more the norm than not (such as some places in India). Yet, some parties want to legalistically ban the practice of arranged marriage for all people. There is no verse in scripture along the lines of "there is no problem with arranged marriage" (i.e., a verse directly apropos to the question at hand); however, we have plenty examples of it in scripture without any negative comment. For example, Isaac and Rebecca, and even Mary and Joseph, the human parents of our dear Lord and Savior. So, using indirect reasoning, we can still dogmatically say that there is no problem with arranged marriage, even though the Bible doesn't say such directly.

Keep in mind that this kind of teaching is different from opinion and conjecture. Teachers have a responsibility to teach the truth (which is objective and absolute), not personal opinions. No, what this content section deals with is not conjecture, but conclusions that are are reached somewhat indirectly from reasoning based on direct scripture.

So why bother marking it out, rather than having all teaching presented as fundamentally the same? For one thing, while we as teachers can still be confident in indirect arguments from scripture if we go about the process the right way, by their very nature, there are more "things to go wrong" -- it is easier for teachers to mess things up in indirect arguments, simply because there are more steps between the interpretation in question and scripture. When the Bible says something directly, it's pretty hard to get things wrong, but when you have to string together a more complex argument to get from A to B, imperfect human logic can lead to incorrect conclusions.

In this way, marking out indirect reasoning can signal to readers "you ought to check this section a bit more closely to make sure you see how the conclusions are ultimately traceable to direct scripture."

#### Arguments from probability

Arguments from probability deserve a special mention. Generally, these arguments are not deductive in nature, but inductive. This means that they don't really mesh with the black-and-white approach to truth advisable for Bible teaching. However, given that they may still serve as guideposts when considering things, they may occasionally show up in these sections of indirect reasoning.

A good example of an appropriate use of an argument from probability can be seen in the debate surrounding the false notion that the gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew (e.g., [see here](https://ichthys.com/mail-Matthew%20in%20Hebrew.htm)). If Matthew were in fact originally written in Hebrew, we would expect to have some old Hebrew manuscripts (closer to the first century AD) to back up such a claim. However, we don't. The gospel of Matthew shows up overwhelmingly in Greek, and while Hebrew copies of Matthew do eventually appear, they are late.

People who push for Matthew being written originally in Hebrew might make an argument along the lines of "Matthew was originally written in Hebrew, but only Greek copies happened to get preserved due to historical happenstance." While we have no direct scriptural evidence we can use to refute such a claim, an argument from probability regarding the lack of Hebrew textual evidence shines light on what this claim really is: complete and utter rubbish.

### Application

{{% application %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /application %}}

As already mentioned several times on this page, the discussions of application on this site are noteworthy relative to other content since they are the only writings that contain things other than direct exposition from scripture. This is because application is very much an individual matter.

Each of us has a unique combination of spiritual gifts given to us at salvation (not to mention our own inborn talents and aptitudes, things also coming ultimately from the hand of God), along with personal experiences that have shaped us over many years, and a collection of present circumstances limiting the sample space of workable choices before us. Put simply, each of us is unqiue with unique circumstances, so what is right for me may not be right for you, and vice versa.

Of course, some things in scripture *are* completely black and white (e.g., "flee *porneia*"); these are not areas of application. On the whole, however, these black-and-white matters only compose a small fraction of the total number of things facing us each and every day. For this reason, it is vitally important that Christians learn to hone their own spiritual discernment and learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit. 

#### The content of these application sections

Writing in these special application sections does not set out to prescribe but to describe; rather than coming to conclusions, individual application sections instead focus on:

* Examination of potential personal circumstances, and how different circumstances might change the fabric of the decision space.
* Identification of variables that are likely to be relevant and important.
* Analysis and discussion of these variables based on data, (my) personal experience, general observation, and reason and logic (e.g., arguments from probability). Cost-benefit analyses, evaluations of pros and cons of various options, and other things of this sort. (On the concept of weighing different variables in making decisions, see [this page](https://www.steventammen.com/pages/decision-analysis/) from my personal website).
* Exploration of routes of application, often including visual flowcharts.

Following the concept that "a picture is worth a thousand words," these flowcharts help visualize decisions within various matters of application. Let me here emphasize that, like all suggestions regarding application, these are not to be taken as hard-and-fast rules, but merely places to start examining potential routes of application based on various circumstances. Here's an example relating to the question of how much to work:

[![Career Decisions](career-decisions.png)](career-decisions.png)

On these flowcharts, the gray ovals represent the start point and end point(s) for the process, the beige diamonds represent choices within the process (with the orange labels labeling the decision branches), and the white rectangles represent sub-processes to be completed.

We need to be relying first and foremost on the guidance of the Holy Spirit to get things right, but this does not mean that we cannot or should not also utilize more systematic methods like those described here (analyzing problems, weighing considerations, and making evidence-based decisions).

#### Ours is a God of the impossible, and faith is a muscle that must be exercised

One final caveat regarding application is that while it is reasonable and appropriate to make a habit of "doing our homework" when making decisions (as in the more systemetized process above), it is important that we not wed ourselves *only* to practical considerations, for ours is a God of the impossible. For example:

* Moses, God's chosen representative to appeal to Pharoah to free the Israelites from Egypt, was not a good speaker (Exodus 4:10, Exodus 6:12, Exodus 6:30-7:2).
* David, still a young lad, was the one to defeat Goliath, rather than a seasoned miltary veteran.
* Peter, a fisherman without apparent educational credentials (compare Acts 4:13), became an important leader in the early Church.

In all these cases, "logic" would demand a different course of action than what was ordained in the (perfect and singular) Will of God. Yet these men, in faith, acted as God would have them act nonetheless. Their example should not be lost on us.

Faith is a muscle that must be exercised. Sometimes God sends tests our way that are more or less along the lines of choosing to believe His testimony (as found in the Bible) over what our eyes may see and our ears may hear. Our systematic analysis may tell us to do one thing, for example, while we perhaps feel led to something that ranks quite poorly in that analysis.

The line to walk here is appreciating the importance of faith in our decisions (and taking great pains to not be closed to paths that require us to trust God and not have everything perfectly figured out) while not at the same time inherently valuing decisions that require lots of faith, as if they were somehow better on account of them being more impractical and unrealistic. In other words, while sometimes stepping out against seemingly impossible odds is exercising godly faith (so we should never truly count most paths of application out, even if they seem unworkable from our perspective), sometimes doing such is also just foolish. Knowing the one from the other is why application is hard, and requires spiritual growth to the point of maturity.

### Technical discussion

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

{{% /technical-discussion %}}

[As described above](#writing-level), the higher level of writing on this site sometimes contains technical discussion that is not included in the lower level of writing for the same content. In general, the purpose of this discussion is to formally justify points made without toning things down much. This is not to say that discussions that fall into this special content section are made purposefully impenetrable or anything like that, but simply that the discussion is not in any way tempered for an audience with less knowledge.

The upshot of this for most people is that you can probably safely ignore these sections unless you are interested in the full treatment. I am careful to include "the upshot" of technical discussions in the normal text, meaning that these sections are completely optional. (If you skip them, I won't suddenly reference something from them further down, e.g.).

The exact topics of technical discussion sections can vary, but the main idea is that they are focused on things that lay Christians really need not worry about understanding fully unless they have particular interest. A non-exhaustive list of things that can show up in technical discussion sections:

* Analysis, critique, and comparison of scholarly and doctrinal viewpoints on various matters.
* Many things related to Greek and Hebrew
* Many things relating to textual criticism
* Many things relating to more complicated topics in hermeneutics
* More complicated facets of biblical archaeology
* Etc.

{{% /cautionary-notes %}}

Content falling into these cautionary notes sections is of two primary types:

* Warnings against false teaching
* Warnings against traps and pitfalls in application

Whether or not you read these sections (and/or how much time you spend seriously considering them) should naturally depend some on your overall level of spiritual maturity. Once a certain level of maturity is obtained, we are inherently more resistant to being blown off course by things that are false (see Ephesians 4:14-16), and also have more spiritual discernment to help us better grasp the general character of what we ought to be about (Romans 12:2). However, it never hurts to get a degree of exposure and inoculation to dangers in both these areas, so that when you encounter them in the wild, they don't take you off-guard. (The principle is much the same here as with vaccines in medicine).

The false teaching under consideration runs the full spectrum, from almost blindingly obvious things ("Give me money for my private yacht and God will bless you!") to the much more subtle.

The traps and pitfalls in application also vary in nuance, ranging from "No, honoring your parents does not mean you should help them deal drugs" to less simple matters more like "Sometimes it can be a mistake to be too specific in the advice you give to impressionable new believers as they may come to rely on your word more than their own developing spiritual discernment, which can cause problems for both them and you down the road."

Some people might protest that application is inherently an individual matter (see above) -- how can you dogmatically call some things out as "wrong" given this? Perhaps the best way to answer this is by analogy. In college, I had a Greek professor who often liked to remind us (particularly after tests!) that "Just because there are many correct translations does not mean that there are not incorrect ones." The same idea holds here. While we cannot be dogmatic about what someone else definitely should do, we *can* be dogmatic about some things they definitely *should't* do.

## Caveats with recordings of study groups

I run three different online Christian study groups (a Bible study group, a Greek group, and a Hebrew group), record our meetings, and post the videos on YouTube.

There are several important caveats that should be kept in mind with these videos:

### These videos may not represent my current views

While, like all responsible teachers, I endeavor to only teach those things I am myself confident in, this does not make me immune from being wrong. Even the best of us occasionally come to see that we have been mistaken about something when new evidence rolls in.

Because there is no time-efficient mechanism for updating these video recordings, they are never updated or corrected over time, unlike all the written content on this site. For this reason, there is always the possibility that these videos contain things that are incorrect, or at least not-quite-correct.

### These videos contain “shooting from the hip”

While I do prepare for the meetings of the study groups, a lot of what is said is ad-hoc, coming off the top of my head. I do try to avoid being *too* loose with things, but there is no way to get around the fact that these study recordings contain some degree of me “shooting from the hip,” unlike the more rigorous written materials of this site. This might mean that I occasionally make remarks that are simply incorrect, I put the emphasis somewhere it shouldn’t be, and things of this sort.

While at times, the consequences of me shooting from the hip end up being little more than me being somewhat inelegant in my speech, it is occasionally more than just this. As a rule of thumb, I would say that I am actually straight up wrong fairly infrequently, but phrase things in a less-than-optimal way much more frequently.

### These videos contain the thoughts of others

I am not the only person talking on these recordings. I have made the point above that you ought to take my extemporaneous speech on the recordings with a grain of salt, but I can vouch even less for the thoughts of others.

In general, many of the folks who participate are trustworthy and knowledgeable, but these are just generalizations, and even insightful people sometimes stumble.

If I *really* disagree with something someone else said, I will generally challenge it. However, this does not mean that I necessarily agree with everything else that I don’t as explicitly challenge. For example, sometimes it can be difficult to constructively critique a statement, or it simply wouldn’t be very profitable to do so.

Oftentimes I find that I disagree with phrasing more than anything else; that is, I would probably try to make a statement more rigorous, less blunt (and potentially offensive), or perhaps less absolutist (as if it must necessarily be true, with no room for debate).

### What is the upshot of all these observations?

For all of the reasons above, if something said in one of these study recordings seems “off” or “fishy,” I highly recommend you look on the site to see if the topic is covered in a written study somewhere. It is possible that the (more up-to-date, more rigorous) written study will correctly handle something that is incorrect in the video, or simply cover it better.

## Peculiarities with posted correspondence in the questions and answers section

By "posted correspondence," I mean the two subtypes of Q&As (Reader Correspondence, Mentor Correspondence) that deal with actual email conversations rather than the subtype that is entirely self-generated by me.

### This content is not updated in the normal way

Not being able to update videos in any time-efficient way is one thing, but what of posted email correspondence? Such conversations could hypothetically be transparently updated over time, yet I still choose not to do such when Q&As involve communication with other people. Why? Because I don't ever want to misrepresent the words of others.

Let's say I clean up my writing from a response I sent someone, and overwrite what I actually sent them with my new shiny version. Their writing is all based on what I actually sent, but since my new version is what readers of the Q&A see, they might get a warped view of the exchange.

Most of the time this might not present much of a problem. For example, if I'm just making an explanation I wrote better, then there's really not much harm to come from that. But what if the conversation is a bit more heated, with points and counterpoints made? If I change "my side" of the discussion, that is kind of like winners rewriting the history books.

All the Q&As are anonymous, it is true, so one might argue that these would be victimless crimes, as it were. But the thought of it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so my policy is to post all conversations as they really happened, absenting personal information and circumstances.

With this being said, the benefits of being able correct and/or update my writing are undeniable. The question is thus if there some way to have my cake and eat it too?

#### Post hoc notes

The phrase ["post hoc"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/post%20hoc) essentially means "after the fact." The problem with updating writing from past exchanges transparently is that the reader is never made aware that changes were made since the exchange. But as long as I clearly label changes as post hoc notes -- notes containing information added during or after publication rather than being part of the initial exchange -- then no one can get the wrong idea about things.

Some notes may be added "in-line" while others may be too long for this, so that they are instead contained in sections with a different, purple background color (much in the same way special content sections were marked out above). Here's examples of both kinds of post hoc notes with Lorem Ipsum text:

##### In-line post hoc note

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [**Post hoc note:** this is an inline note], sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

##### Longer post hoc note

<div style="background: #f2d9f2; border-radius: 5px; padding: 0px 10px;">
<strong style="display:block; text-align:center;"><a href="/about-the-site/#post-hoc-notes">Post hoc note</a></strong>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
</div>

### This content is not ever rewritten at a lower writing level

Based on this same principle of not rewriting the history of conversations that actually happened, I do not offer any posted correspondence in a lower level version with simplified writing.

Simplifying my own words might warp the reader's perception of the conversation that actually happened (compare the above discussion), but at the same time, I know more or less what I was thinking when I wrote things, so the overall damage would at least be contained. In contrast to this, imagine all the hidden shoals in me trying to simplify the writing of others -- without being inside their head, how do I know if I even properly understand what it is they were trying to say? Hopefully it is clear then why I do not even attempt to rewrite posted correspondence at a lower level.

## FAQs

### Ministry and website

#### Why the name "BibleDocs"?

It is accepted good practice (as well as my own opinion) that URLs of websites should be generally descriptive of their content. It also helps if they are as short as possible, for a variety of reasons (such as being easier to remember and easier to type).

Put simply, this website primarily contains text documents <!-- (HTML, PDF, ePub, etc.) -->centered around the Bible. Hence BibleDocs. This URL is both descriptive and short.

Having a dash in the URL would make it more cumbersome to share orally -- to avoid ambiguity, the URL would have to be read "Bible dash docs dot org." As it is, it can be read simply as "Bible docs dot org," and people will tend to automatically type in the correct address (without a dash) when they get to their computer.

#### Why .org not .com?

This site is dedicated to Bible teaching, offered freely to all; this is a ministry of grace. Traditionally, .com domains were the province of commercial entities, while .org domains were the province of nonprofits. Over time, many people started using .coms for everything, including nonprofit work, and they became more dominant.

However, since it seems to me that .org domains do not present recognizability problems for people who are less technically aware (contrast less well-known alternate global top level domains like .io and .co, as used by some startups), and are unambiguous with respect to commercial intent (unlike .com domains), it makes sense for this site, which is firmly in the nonprofit camp, to use a .org domain.

#### Why have fancy web design? Does the shininess take away from the content?

Compared to Ichthys, say, this website has a bit more interface sparkle. I have taken care to keep content pages entirely text-centric with no unecessary interface distractions; the shininess most assuredly *does not* take away from the content. Most of the more complicated interface stuff shows up on the home page, which has some fancier content sectioning and grids of image links.

The idea behind this is not any sort of "marketing-first" approach (this sort of thing makes me completely nauseous when I encounter it in other Christian websites -- all style and no substance), but simply to use modern web design so that the interface does not present a stumbling block to anyone. Put simply, for better or worse, some people are put off by a website that is "too 1990s," so I have just made the website look more like most other modern websites.

People who don't care about interface (i.e., the people that would be fine with a home page containing nothing but lists of links embedded in text) aren't going to care either way, but making things shinier will work out better for people who do care more about interface. The idea here is more or less along the lines of "being all things to all people" (compare 1 Corinthians 9:19-23).

I'm also a web applications developer by day. What can I say?

#### Who is behind this ministry?

This ministry is currently a one-man operation run by me, Steven Tammen. You can read more about me on the [about the author page](/about-the-author).

#### Does this ministry accept donations or other financial support?

No. This is a ministry of grace -- offered freely to all -- with no expectation of compensation. I work a normal job to support myself and those dependent on me, while providing these materials to the Church as my true calling in life. Cf. Paul's tentmaking, 1 Corinthians 9. (Paul, I'm sure, was much better at this than I am).

As that chapter makes clear, there is nothing wrong with pastor-teachers being paid for their efforts. For various reasons, I have chosen the path I have. Among other things, being financially independent allows me to be completely outspoken about issues that I might otherwise be hesitant to speak up about, as doing so could compromise my livelihood if I were a full-time pastor. (Unfortunate as this reality is).

If you are searching for worthy causes to contribute to, [see below]().

#### Is this ministry associated with any denomination or group?

No. Further, as my formal Greek and Hebrew study was undertaken at the[ University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) -- a secular research university (rather than a seminary) -- I do not even have a historical association with any denomination or group.

Broadly speaking, this ministry falls within the conservative evangelical tradition. However, it splits with much of contemporary Christianity on a number of points, such that I prefer to simply say that this ministry is what it is.

#### Why is this ministry focused on written text largely to the exclusion of videos, podcasts, and so on?

In short, because text is the medium *par excellence* for dedicated study, for a variety of reasons. <!-- You can read more about my thoughts on this[ on my secular website](https://www.steventammen.com/screen-reading/). -->

This is not to say that there are not valid reasons for videos and podcasts to exist. For one thing, you can't read a study in the car, when working out, when cooking, etc. This reason alone is enough to make media that can be converted to audio very useful in terms of being time-efficient.

Moreover, some people are dyslexic and are much faster listening to things than reading them (most people are the opposite). Some people are visually impaired and physically *cannot* make use of text as a medium (or can only do so at a severely reduced capacity). You get the idea.

Nonetheless, for most people, when sitting down and studying in a dedicated fashion, text reigns far supreme. It is for this reason that this ministry focuses on text to the exclusion of all else. If you are interested in audio/video content, I would recommend you check out [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists), an in-depth YouTube teaching ministry centered around informational videos Khan-Academy-style, or [Bible Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChhe0vK1hz8bxzcphHWpFmg/playlists), another in-depth YouTube teaching ministry. (You can rip the audio from the YouTube videos from either ministry to get the studies as MP3's).

#### Why pages for video guides?

Unlike most content on this site, which is all text due to the enormous advantages text has as a study medium, <!-- (see /pages/advantages-of-text-as-study/medium) --> the actual content of guides is primarily video-based, since videos are objectively better for guides (which really ought to “show” rather than “tell”). So why even bother having this section on the site, and instead just leave all the organization of videos on YouTube?

Two big reasons. First, if I ever want to update a guide by uploading an updated video and subsequently unlisting the old video (so it doesn’t appear on my YouTube profile, but also doesn’t break already-existing links to it; compare 301 redirects), it is beneficial to preserve the same URL for the guide. If people link to the URL of the guide page on my website, then when I update the guide, while the video may have changed to some degree, *they never have to manually update their links* to point to the most up-to-date version of the guide. From their perspective, it happens transparently, minimizing work for them. I benefit by (primarily) having only the most recent versions of my content receiving link traffic.

Second, while it is true that video guides make lots of sense, it is very common for me to want to discuss things brought up in a guide or tangentially related to a guide in more detail. Keeping such discussion (that doesn’t benefit from the video medium in the same way as actual guide content — like demonstrations and such — does) in text means it receives all the benefits of text as a medium, as above, and also, importantly, *keeps it out of the video*. Keeping guide videos short, focused, and to-the-point is extremely important. While it would be possible to put some of this “guide-related content” in the description of YouTube videos, it is better to put it on the site, where there is much more flexibility (e.g., I can actually use hyperlinks with link text, use images, have sections with different background colors, etc.) and it can take advantage of the (completely automatic) creation of section header links and a table of contents that readers can use in linking to specific parts of the page.

#### Can I change the Bible version used in verse tagging?

Yes. You can change settings related to verse tagging [on the settings page](/settings/#reftagger-control-panel).

### Connections and associations

#### You said you don't take donations. Do you know of good causes?

For a variety of reasons, it is my opinion that believer-to-believer aid is best done directly (especially in our modern internet age, where giving via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home), [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/), and the like is easy and secure). No matter how efficient a charity proper is (and some are in fact a whole lot better than others: see [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/)), it will always have a lot more overhead than direct giving.

Contributing to others without any middlemen also allows you to directly judge the worthiness of the recipients of your support (contrast again charities proper). It is an unpleasant truth that not all people who receive charity money need said money, or will use it for good purposes (for example, they might use it to buy drugs, or use to buy food and then use their own money instead to buy drugs). Ultimately, while there is certainly nothing wrong in helping alleviate material poverty, we are not here to ease economic distress, but to share the gospel that people might be saved, and to help them grow in the truth thereafter. Money that goes towards these spiritual ends is in truth much more important.

For this reason, I find it best to prioritize giving money either to Christians who are legitimately in need of aid due to difficult material circumstances (not due to a rash of poor decisions on their part, but largely as a result of testing outside their control), or to Christians who are in need of money to help support their service to the body of Christ (by freeing up their time, for example). Towards these ends:

- One public ministry that takes donations that I can recommend wholeheartedly is [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists).
- There are also other private individuals I support that I would be happy to get people in contact with. You can email me at [steven@bibledocs.org](mailto:steven@bibledocs.org) for more information.

Note that money is not the only way we can assist one another. I have helped various people set up ministry websites, for example. A contact of mine has helped another with some rehabilitation exercises based upon his experience as a personal trainer. And so on.

I personally maintain an [address book](/address-book) for the purpose of connecting believers I know with one another based on need and interest. If there is specific expertise you have that you are interested in sharing with the Body of Christ, you can email me ([steven@bibledocs.org](mailto:steven@bibledocs.org)) and I will make sure to add it specifically (and list your contact information publicly, if you are comfortable with such).

## Backend

See also the [GitHub repository's Readme](https://github.com/StevenTammen/bibledocs.org/blob/master/README.md).

### Content

The content of this site is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) with an excellent [Realtime Markdown Preview Plugin](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) as my editor of choice, along with a lot of macros and text expansions done through the Windows scripting language [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

If Vim is a bit scary, I would recommend either setting up [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and editing content through the online WYSIWYG interface, or using [Typora](https://typora.io/) (a Markdown editor) locally.

### Exporting to HTML

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as its static site generator. Pages are run through templates to produce web-ready output. Hugo is incredibly fast, and has been in development long enough that the templating it offers is sufficient for such things as automatically creating content display pages (for all the content that matches a particular category, for example), or conditionally showing page elements depending on what “kind” (Hugospeak: taxonomy) of page is being generated.

### Hosting

This site has the source content located in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/bibledocs.org/), with the generated files being hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify has an extremely fast global content delivery Network (CDN) that caches the entire site, since everything is static. I am using Netlify as my DNS as well, since having the DNS through them lets the CDN work at maximum effectiveness with little configuration.

Netlify also allows for continuous deployment by means of a build command. [Netlify.toml](https://github.com/StevenTammen/steventammen.com/blob/master/netlify.toml) contains information relating to the continuous deployment I use via Netlify (mainly information pertaining to the Hugo command to run on their server). Whenever a build is triggered (I push to the GitHub repository containing the source), Netlify automatically updates all the cache fingerprints for assets, so only the most recent files are on the CDN. Not having to worry about invalidating out of date assets has been one of my favorite things about this current workflow.

### Domain redirects and subdomains

Netlify automatically handles the 301s between the www and non-www versions of the site. I am keeping the www subdomain for several reasons:

1. Having a proper subdomain (rather than a CNAME at root, as in [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/)) allows for Netlify’s CDN to work somewhat more effectively, as described [on this page](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/28/to-www-or-not-www/). The performance considerations apparently revolve around how Netlify’s CDN interacts with the caches commonly kept by DNS providers.
2. Using a proper subdomain allows for cookie separation on subdomains. This is the biggie. Using an Apex domain does not allow you to be selective about which subdomains use the cookies of the main domain, which is a bad thing. Unnecessary cookies slightly increase security risk, and, perhaps more importantly, slow down page loads. This is especially noticeable if you store static assets on the same domain as your primary site (rather than using a separate site entirely, like some big websites do). This is because the cookies will get sent for *every single static asset loaded* – every style sheet, every script, every image. A few kilobytes of cookies can amount to a fairly significant increase in page size if many static assets are used. I much prefer to use a static subdomain on the main site for serving static content (rather than using a separate domain entirely), since it allows you to mirror static URLs to exactly correspond with the content URLs they are associated with. (For example, [www.mysite.com/posts/somepost/](www.mysite.com/posts/somepost/) might have an image stored at [static.mysite.com/posts/somepost/img1.png](static.mysite.com/posts/somepost/img1.png)). This is much more intuitive and easier for readers to link to, and also happens to save a not insubstantial amount of money in the long run by making extra domain registration costs unnecessary.
3. There is not any performance reason to use a bare domain if you can just type in the bare domain and get redirected to the www subdomain anyway (a redirect so fast a human could never process it). So you can still do less typing by ignoring the www if you wish, but the performance benefits of the www subdomain will still be in effect.

### SSL

Netlify provides [easy HTTPS for custom domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/ssl/) by partnering with [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). While security is not super important for this site as I don’t have user sessions or deal with credit card information, I am 100% behind encrypting everything simply on principle.

I also force HTTPS sitewide. So all non-HTTPS requests will automatically get converted to HTTPS requests.

### Performance: gzipping, minification, etc.

Netlify automatically minifies and gzips many content types. It is theoretically possible to gain a better compression level by running a more size-efficient DEFLATE encoder (like [Zopfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopfli)), but the added cycles would slow down site builds for not much gain.

If I anticipate little change in a static asset (a referenced Javascript library, a big image), I may run it through Zopfli to get that maximum compression level. If I link to a an already compressed file, Netlify won’t mess with it.

### Email

I use [forwardemail.net](https://forwardemail.net/en/pricing) to handle all email through the site (rather than, say, Google Apps for Business).


## Continuous improvement

I view this site as a perpetual "work in progress" rather than a collection of static documents in an immutable framework. This constant refinement over time is, in my opinion, essential to long-term quality. Changes to individual pages can be tracked by viewing the commit history of their markdown source in the site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/bibledocs.org/). I may clean out the commit history every once in a while if it gets too cluttered, but, for any given page, you'll generally be able to get a pretty good idea of what's happened in the last few commits.
