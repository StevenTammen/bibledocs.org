## What "beginning" is in view?

The "beginning" of Genesis 1:1 is the beginning of God’s actions regarding the material universe, not the beginning of the material universe. The short version of what I mean by this is that Genesis 1:1 is saying

{{% original-translation p="Genesis 1:1" %}}

In beginning [His actions regarding the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth (i.e., created the material universe itself — which was not previously existent).

{{% /original-translation %}}

Not

> In the beginning [of the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth.

Beginning is not definite in the Hebrew of Genesis 1:1 nor the Greek of John 1:1, despite how almost all translations (improperly) take it. That is, the texts actually say "in beginning" not "in the beginning."

We have בְּרֵאשִׁית not בָּרֵאשִׁית in Genesis 1:1. We have Ἐν ἀρχῇ not Ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ in John 1:1. (Genesis 1:1 in the Septuagint also reads Ἐν ἀρχῇ rather than Ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ).

In terms of Genesis 1:1, without the definite article it makes less sense to take the "beginning" described as the beginning of the material universe... was spacetime somehow already in existence during God’s creation of the heavens and the earth? Instead, it makes more sense to take the "beginning" described as the beginning of God’s actions regarding the material universe. This distinction is not merely some exercise in pedantry, but is in fact critically important in properly understanding God’s relation to creation.

The Trinity -- including Christ, the divine *logos* (λόγος) = Word, the agent of creation (compare John 1:3) -- existed before the material universe itself existed. God exists "outside" spacetime — He snapped His fingers, and it came into existence *ex nihilo*, out of nothing. His existence is in no way linked to the beginning of the material universe (which, confusing to our limited brains, coincides with the beginning of time as we think of it — compare special relativity). In fact, it is actually right and proper for us to say that God existed *before* time — he created it, after all.

## How did God exist before space and time?

Well, part one is accepting that as material beings, we are never really going to "get it" — since we are finite and very much bound by linear time, we have exactly zero hope of truly conceptualizing what it means to to be outside of spacetime. Part two is Exodus 3:14-15, God’s identity as I AM (Hebrew: יהוה, transliterated YHVH):

{{% /hebrew-i %}}

Put simply, existence is tied up in who God is. God is the Alpha and Omega, He who is and was and is to come, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End (Revelation 1:8; 22:13). Of what consequence is time to God?

## Recap and summary

To summarize, then, translating John 1:1 and especially Genesis 1:1 as definite (or at least doing such with no further explanation) confuses the matter of God’s pre-creation existence because translating as such tends to make people think that the beginning referenced is "the definite, finite, beginning of material existence/spacetime" (rather than the beginning of God’s actions regarding the material universe). But if this is the case — and God’s creation of the heavens and the Earth proceeded with spacetime already existing, rather than the creation of the heavens and the Earth *being* the creation of spacetime — then is God part of spacetime? Is he bound by it? Is he merely a super-creature?

Of course not. But best to be clear.

Even though the operative phrase in John 1:1 is often translated "in the beginning", there is no definite article present in the Greek (i.e., no "the"). As such, the Greek phrase en archei is a deliberate parallel of the phrase in Genesis 1:1, bereshith, which, likewise, has no definite article (although of course the English versions never reflect this important fact). The lack of the article in both cases is significant. When English speakers hear, "in the beginning", they assume, not completely without reason, that there was some point of departure for everything (including perhaps God – and that is a grave mistake to make). There was a discrete "beginning" for the world we see, the physical universe of space and time (as well as the heavenly dimensions we cannot presently see), but not for God who "is" and always "was" and always "will be" (irrespective of time or space). God existed before He made the universe, before He created the angels, and before any of the seen or unseen parts of the present cosmos came into being through His creative act. Put another way, God transcends time and space. How this is and what this entails defies description by creatures such as we are who have been made for time/space and exist only in time/space. But that is the way it "is", and that is why the language in Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1 is so careful. One could translate the former "the first thing God did [in respect to the universe we now see] was create the heavens and the earth"; and John 1:1 "before creation, the Word was with God". That, in any case, is what the phrases mean respectively: God existed, God "was" before anything was created by Him.
The above has important implications for understanding "who" God is, and also for understanding the Trinity. To put this as simply as possible, God is spirit (rather than "a spirit"), and His existence as such precedes the cosmos we can see and is completely independent of it. The world only exists because God created it, and only continues to exist because He "holds it together" (that is the meaning of the Greek at Colossians 1:17). God could have created a quadrillion such universes in the blink of an eye, and still certainly can.

Here’s a quote from [Bartek](/links/#writings-from-the-desk-of-TODO) on some of the significance of all this:

{{% scripture src="https://ichthys.com/Bartek/John1-1.pdf" text="Bartek > John 1:1" %}}
The Greek [of John 1:1] says "in beginning" (there is no definite article before "beginning" in Greek) and that is an exact equivalent of the Hebrew בְּרֵאשִׁית (bereshith) in Genesis 1:1 which has the same meaning and to which John here directly refers ("beginning" is anarthrous in Hebrew as well). Genesis 1:1 says that "in beginning God created the heavens and the earth", thus bereshith denoting the state at the point when God began the work of creation (Luginbill, n.d.) – not the beginning of creation itself. The latter view results in a logical error, as according to it at the point when God began to create – which is here described as "in beginning" - creation would already have to have been there, as only then "in beginning" could be taken to mean "beginning of creation", but the very point is that it is at that point that God started His creative work.

By writing en archē John refers to the same point in time as Moses did in Genesis 1:1 – the point when as yet there was nothing. And just as Moses moves forward from that point to tell of God’s first creative act ("In [the] beginning God created the heavens and the earth"), so John describes the state before creation came into being. And before creation came into being, the Word was (John 17:5; cf. Micah 5:2).

### Genesis 1:1 is a statement of historical description not a forward-looking summary

We’re not yet done handling the misunderstandings surrounding this first verse of the Bible. Partially caused by the common improper inclusion of the definite article in translation, many people take Genesis 1:1 as a forward-looking summary of the seven days described in the following verses rather than as a statement of historical description.^[fn:1]

[fn:1] : Although the improper inclusion of the definite article does not logically necessitate taking Genesis 1:1 as a forward-looking summary (i.e., it is perfectly possible to translate as "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" while simultaneously not taking the verse as a forward-looking summary), it does make such an interpretation somewhat more attractive. It is somewhat a chicken-or-the-egg situation: does this interpretation get put forward because of the improper inclusion of the definite article, or is the definite article improperly included (largely) because of this interpretation?

Taking Genesis 1:1 as a forward-looking summary means understanding things in the following way:

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth (event 1): first this thing happened (event 1.1), and then this thing happened (event 1.2), …

As opposed to viewing verse 1 as a historical event that preceded the things described in following verses:

> In beginning, God created the heavens and the earth (event 1). Then this thing happened (event 2), and then this thing happened (event 3), …

I could make my own technical argument as to why the second view is correct, but Ichthys has some good discussion on this already in [Part 2 of the Satanic Rebellion Series](https://ichthys.com/sr2-copy.htm#I.%20Linguistic%20Evidence%20for%20the%20Genesis%20Gap:):

{{% scripture src="https://ichthys.com/sr2-copy.htm#I.%20Linguistic%20Evidence%20for%20the%20Genesis%20Gap:" text="Ichthys > SR2" %}}
First of all, the opening sentence of the Bible (taken by itself, and examined without any preconceptions) purports to be just what we are suggesting here: an historical description of God's first action vis-à-vis the material universe, namely His original creation of it. On the other hand, problems for the alternative summary-statement theory arise as soon as we move on to verse two. For the earth is there described as being "without form, and void" (KJV). But if verse one is not an actual description of the creation of the heavens and the earth, but rather merely a summary of the whole seven days that follow, then how are we to explain the fact that there is no re-statement of its initial creation in the detailed account? Where did this formless "earth" come from? Are we to suppose that it did somehow exist before original creation? That would be quite a blow for all who genuinely believe in a God who transcends the universe and in His ex nihilo creation of it (see section II below). If, on the other hand, earth really was originally created "from nothing", it seems beyond odd not to mention that creation in the detailed account of the seven days (if indeed we are to assume that they represent original creation), and, on that account, strained to assume that the bald statement of its creation in verse one is a mere summary.

Now, this leaves us at the point where we are taking Genesis 1:1 as describing God’s ex nihilo creation of the material universe ("the heavens and the earth") rather than acting as a summary statement for the verses that follow.

## Verse 2

The question that follows is thus 




We’ll get to exactly what the so-called "Genesis Gap" is when discussing the second verse just below, but for now note that it is essentially impossible to take verse 1 as a forward-looking summary if one at all cares about what the Hebrew actually says.

I know this seems jarring to many because it means, in essence, that I am saying that anyone who does not come to this conclusion is being unfaithful to the biblical text. Perhaps this starkness would not be so striking were it not for the fact that essentially all translations have it wrong. So am I saying that translators and theologians for hundreds of years have done violence to the grammar of the first and second verses of the Bible? Yes, yes I am.
Consider the fact that the number of people believing one interpretation over the other in this particular case is of almost no consequence because everyone who does not have Hebrew is led to believe the "Genesis 1:1 as forward-looking summary" position by default; English translations leave no other option. On the other hand, imagine if this were the translation generally put before people:

From Ichthys

Before all else, God created the heavens and the earth. But the earth came to be ruined and despoiled – darkness lay upon the face of the abyss while God's Spirit brooded over the surface of its waters.
Genesis 1:1-2

This isn’t some indistinct matter of opinion; it’s grammar. The fact that most all English translations "get this wrong" and most people
