## What "beginning" is in view?

Genesis 1:1 is the first verse in the Bible. It mentions the word "beginning." The question is then, what beginning is in view? One possibility is that the beginning is referring to the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe.  Another possibility is that the beginning is referring to the beginning of the material universe itself.

If the beginning is referring to the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe, then we might translate: 

{{% original-translation p="Genesis 1:1" %}}

In beginning [His actions regarding the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth (i.e., created the material universe itself — which was not previously existent).

{{% /original-translation %}}

But if the beginning is referring to the beginning of the material universe, then we might translate: 

> In the beginning [of the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth.

The Hebrew text of Genesis 1:1 in the Old Testament supports the first possibility. The Greek text of Genesis 1:1 in the Old Testament also supports the first possibility. (Since the Old Testament was initially written in Hebrew, this Greek version of the Old Testament was a translation for people who could only read Greek, not read Hebrew. It was called the Septuagint). Finally, the Greek text of John 1:1 in the New Testament supports the first possibility. John 1:1 also mentions beginnings, and is closely parallel with Genesis 1:1. 

These all support the first possibility because of something called a "definite article." This means that all three texts say "*the* beginning" rather than just "a beginning." 

Without the definite article it makes less sense to take the beginning in Genesis 1:1 as the beginning of the material universe. This is because doing such would seem to imply that space and time were somehow already in existence during God's creation of the heavens and the Earth. (Sometimes "space and time" are written together as "spacetime," since physicists have shown that the two things are closely related). 

God exists as three persons that share one essence. This doctrine is known as the Trinity. All three members of the Trinity existed before the material universe itself existed. God exists "outside" spacetime. When he commanded it to come into existence from nothing, it did. God's existence is in no way linked to the beginning of the material universe. In fact, it is actually right and proper to say that God existed *before* time, because he created time. 

## How did God exist before space and time?

We human beings are very small and finite. Due to this limited perspective, we don't have much hope at truly understanding exactly what it means to be outside of space and time. This acknowledgement of our own limits is the first step to accepting the difficult idea of God existing outside of space and time.

The second step is understanding God's identity as I AM. In Exodus 3:14–15 God declares to Moses that His name is "I AM." Put simply, existence is tied up in who God is. God is the Alpha and Omega, He who is and was and is to come, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End (Revelation 1:8; 22:13). For this reason, time is of little consequence to God. 

## Recap and summary

We discussed how Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1 do not have direct articles, meaning the texts read "a/an" not "the." This supports the idea that the beginning referred to is the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe, not the beginning of the material universe itself. Not translating properly or failing to explain this properly can obscure this fact.

The big issue with not getting this right is that it might give the false impression that God’s creation of the heavens and the Earth proceeded with spacetime already existing. Some people might think based on this that God is merely a very powerful creature that is also bound by space and time in the universe like we are. But we saw above that God exists outside spacetime. 

The right way to take it is instead that God's creation of the heavens and the Earth *is* the creation of spacetime.
