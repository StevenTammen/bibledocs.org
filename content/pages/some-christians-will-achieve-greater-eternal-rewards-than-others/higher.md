In this material world of ours, distinctions are made every day with regards to merit and distinguished service. While it is true that the idea of "everyone gets a trophy" has been gaining ground of late, it is nonetheless the case that most people do not seem to have great philosophical objection to the idea of different levels of recognition and reward for different levels of service.

When the topic is switched to eternal spiritual rewards for Christians, however, many people seem to have a much more visceral reaction. Perhaps it is because eternal rewards are, well, eternal. Perhaps it is because the idea of salvation coming by grace through faith and not by works is (rightly) highly emphasized as a core teaching, drilling into people a sort of distrust for any reward mentality. Or perhaps, sad as it is to say, some people resist this idea because, upon a bit of self-reflection, they realize that they will not be among the highly decorated if there are actually distinctions in eternal reward. Whatever the reasons, it has been my observation that while the teaching of eternal distinction in reward for Christians is relatively straightforward in scripture, it is in practice a doctrine that many people have issues accepting. The goal of this page is to briefly put forward some of the scriptural evidence for the concept and deal with some common objections.

## A general overview of the teaching

Scripture is quite clear that upon Christ’s return, judgement will be rendered as to the works of men. For example:

{{% nasb h="600px" p="Matthew 16:27  | 2 Corinthians 5:10 | Revelation 22:12" %}}

{{% scripture p="Matthew 16:27  | NIV84" %}}
For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.
{{% /scripture %}}

{{% scripture p="2 Corinthians 5:10 | NIV84" %}}
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
{{% /scripture %}}

{{% scripture p="Revelation 22:12 | NIV84" %}}
“Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done."
{{% /scripture %}}

{{% /nasb %}}

All these passages speak of an evaluation of our works. It follows naturally that if some people have "better works" than others, then they will receive more reward — there is no other way to responsibly interpret these passages.

Paul gives us some more detail on the process of evaluation in 1 Corinthians 3:

{{% nasb h="400px" p="1 Corinthians 3:10-15" %}}

{{% scripture p="1 Corinthians 3:10-15 | NIV84" %}}
**10** By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds. **11** For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. **12** If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, **13** his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man’s work. **14** If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. **15** If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.
{{% /scripture %}}

{{% /nasb %}}

After the fires of judgement, only those things we build upon the sure foundation of Jesus Christ will remain (words and thoughts as well as actions: compare Matthew 12:36–37). This passage incontrovertibly teaches that some people — those who build with gold, silver, and precious stones rather than wood, hay, and stubble; those whose works are not consumed in the fire of evaluation — receive greater reward than others.

Finally, consider the passages that teach that many of the last will be first and the first last:

{{% nasb h="300px" p="Mark 10:31 | Luke 13:30" %}}

{{% scripture p="Mark 10:31 | NIV84" %}}
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.


{{% /scripture %}}

{{% scripture p="Luke 13:30 | NIV84" %}}
Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.”
{{% /scripture %}}

{{% /nasb %}}

These passages directly teach that there is ranking in heaven. If we were all the same in eternity, it would not be possible to have people who are first and last. QED. 

### The parable of the talents and the parable of the minas

These two parables also clearly teach that the level of our reward in eternity is dependent upon what we do here on Earth:

#### The parable of the talents

{{% nasb h="800px" p="Matthew 25:14-30" %}}

{{% scripture p="Matthew 25:14-30 | NIV84" %}}
**14** “Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. **15** To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. **16** The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more. **17** So also, the one with the two talents gained two more. **18** But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. 
**19** “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. **20** The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’ 
**21** “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’ 
**22** “The man with the two talents also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.’ 
**23** “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’ 
**24** “Then the man who had received the one talent came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. **25** So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’ 
**26** “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? **27** Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. 
**28** “ ‘Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. **29** For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. **30** And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

#### The parable of the minas

{{% nasb h="800px" p="Luke 19:11-27" %}}

{{% scripture p="Luke 19:11-27 | NIV84" %}}
**11** While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. **12** He said: “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. **13** So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Put this money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’ 
**14** “But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’ 
**15** “He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. 
**16** “The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’ 
**17** “ ‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’ 
**18** “The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’ 
**19** “His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’ 
**20** “Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. **21** I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’ 
**22** “His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow? **23** Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?’ 
**24** “Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ 
**25** “ ‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’ 
**26** “He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away. **27** But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.’ ”

#### Discussion

While these two parables are not identical in all the particulars, they teach more or less the same thing. When interpreting a parable, an important first step is identifying exactly what things in the parable stand for. With this in mind:

- In both these parables, the master represents our Lord, Jesus Christ.
- In both these parables, the servants represent believers... with the exception of the servant who buries his money and is subsequently thrown into the darkness -- Matthew 25:30 -- for faith without works is dead (that is, not true faith; compare James 2:17).
- In both these parables, the money given to the servants (us) represents all that God has given to us -- talents/aptitudes, material possessions, opportunities, and so on. (In truth, all we have in life comes from the hand of God, in Whom all things hold together -- Colossians 1:17).
- In both these parables, the going away of the master represents Christ's ascension to be with the Father -- veiled from our eyes -- and the return of the master represents the second advent of Christ.
- In both these parables, the rewards given to the servants after the master's return represent the rewards that will be bestowed upon believers after Christ's second advent in the judgement and reward of the Church.

#### These parables pose issues for the false doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture

While far from the most direct or convincing evidence against the false doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture, it is nonetheless true that these passages must be explained away if one is to adopt the doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture.

The doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture typically postulates some sort of pseudo-return of Christ before the tribulation (at which point the Church is raptured, in the manner of 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17), with the full second advent (the eschatological "coming" or "return" of Christ mentioned in Matthew 24:27, 37; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; and elsewhere -- Greek [παρουσία](https://biblehub.com/greek/3952.htm), parousia) happening before Armageddon at the end of the tribulation. In the intervening period, so the doctrine goes, Christians are spared from the judgements on the world described in Revelation since they are not on Earth but in heaven.

Accordingly, what supporters of the pre-trib position must explain vis-à-vis these two parables is as follows:

- If the return of the master represents this supposed pseudo-return of Christ (such that the judgement and reward of the Church precedes the tribulation), then why is the return in The Parable of the Minas presented as permanent/absolute? (In Luke 19:15, the aorist participial phrase λαβόντα τὴν βασιλείαν, meaning essentially "after receiving the kingdom," is modifying the returning master... would he receive the kingdom if he were not actually returned in full?).
- If the return of the master represents the actual second advent of Christ -- so that the evaluation of the servants' production described in these parables is happening not at the point of the supposed rapture, but at the point of Christ's full return at the second advent -- then how do you reconcile the fact that the parables present the judgement and evaluation of the servants' production as the first interaction between them and the master (whom they have not seen in a long time), while the doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture necessitates raptured Christians (servants) being in the presence of their master for *years* before being evaluated?

In contrast to the above problems, taking the timing of the rapture -- the events described in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 -- to be Christ's full second advent (i.e., putting forward only one *parousia* of Christ, at the end of the tribulation) meshes with the parables perfectly: Christ (the master) returns once -- permanently -- and immediately judges the Church (the servants of the parables) based on their production.

The parable of the talents (Matt.25:14-30), and the parable of the minas (Lk.19:11-27), though not identical in all details do teach the same principles. In both cases, the master or king represents our Lord, while we are represented by his servants. In each telling of this parable, the servants are given money belonging to their lord and commanded to make good use of it until he returns (with his return representing the Second Advent). The money given to (us) represents the means, opportunity, and authority (cf. Mk.13:34) to act for the Lord in His stead here on earth according to the gifts we have been given (*n.b.*, the English word "talent" actually comes from this parable). Talents and minas are both monetary units used throughout the ancient Mediterranean world from Babylon to Rome. Depending upon the specific standard employed, the approximate weight of a talent could range from some 60 to 100 pounds. At current rates for gold, therefore, a single talent might be worth as much as a million and half dollars in contemporary terms (although its buying power in the ancient economy where money was scarcer in relative terms would be significantly greater). A mina (or mna), was commonly one sixtieth of a talent and thus, while still very valuable, was worth considerably less (i.e., comparing the total value of the amounts given to the servants who received the talents to that given to the servants who each received a single mina equates roughly to eight million dollars versus twenty to thirty thousand dollars). The disparate range between these two similar parables indicates a similarly large range in the gifts and opportunities we are given, but the standard of judgment is the same in every case: our Lord expects a return on His investment, and will reward us wonderfully and marvelously in proportion to our efforts (i.e., the one whose mina gained ten more is placed over ten cities; the one whose mina gained five more is placed over five cities), but will do so with a reward that abundantly exceeds our results to an unimaginable degree (i.e., by the standards of the ancient world even more so than today, rulership over a city would be vastly more valuable than a single mina). For our purposes here, we see in both versions that the servants who accomplished the most are judged and rewarded first, and that the judgment continues in a descending order until it reaches the servant who accomplished nothing.



 Put a bit differently, how can one say that Christians will somehow be in the presence of Christ for a long time before the process of judgement and reward when these passages mention the return of the master and evaluation of the servants in essentially the same breath?

That is, according to these passages, the judgement and reward of the Church directly follows the return of the master -- the two things proceed lockstep. (Compare also Daniel 12:13 -- reward is described as immediately following resurrection of the dead, which we know is talking about the same event as the gathering up of living believers per 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).



## How can differentiation in eternal rewards be reconciled with the parable of the vineyard workers?

### Discussion

TODO: rework this whole section. 

See https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part6.htm#the%20parable%20of%20the%20workers%20in%20the%20vineyard

At first glance, this parable can seem to go against the point that we have repeatedly made above that eternal rewards are not all the same, instead being awarded proportionally based upon the actual measure of people’s dedication to the Lord in this life. After all, all the workers here receive the same wage, despite some doing much more work than others.

So what gives? Put simply this apparent contradiction comes from missing the fact the denarius in this parable refers to salvation rather than recompense for one’s labor for the Lord; the "pay" here is of a totally different character than the recompense from all passages above. The whole point of this parable is that we can’t work our way into heaven, because salvation is a gift of grace. Thus, the thief on the cross (compare Luke 23:39–43) will receive exactly the same salvation as a lifelong believer — a blissful eternity of fellowship with God and one another with no tears or pain (among other things) — despite believing only in his last moments of life.

There is no contradiction in God giving out salvation freely (on the basis of Christ’s sacrifice for us on the cross) while still rewarding believers for their above-and-beyond response to Him. He certainly wouldn’t have to to be just (for, as Luke 17:10 states, "we are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty," and God does not in truth need anything from us), but all the passages above make it clear that God is so rich in kindness and grace that on top of saving us out of our sins by judging His one and only son in our place (i.e., freely giving us the denarius of salvation — even if we are workers in the last afternoon shift), He also gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our love for Him by working in faith to earn even higher levels of reward.

## TODO





God’s rewards are not zero-sum, so the only thing preventing everyone from achieving the highest level of eternal reward is themselves.

As the passage from 1 Corinthians 3 above states, some people really will be saved "as through fire," with little more than this single denarius of salvation — given to them scandalously without true merit — to show for their time on earth. 



Are we all judged according to the same standard? 

This is a common question that pops up when talking about evaluation and reward. In many ways the answer to this question is yes and no.

In some sense, we are all equally called to perfection (compare Matthew 5:48). All of us are called to grow spiritually, pass the spiritual tests God puts before us to temper our faith, and then help others do likewise — and all spiritual rewards, no matter the person, are essentially based on these things (see the doctrine of the crowns/crowns of reward as described in Part 18 of the Peter Series on Ichthys and in a document from doctrines section of Bible Academy).

However, the exact way God evaluates us personally really does depend upon our individual circumstances, our pasts, the gifts and resources we possess, and a whole host of other factors too varied and complex to enumerate with any degree of specificity and/or comprehensiveness. Compare: 

47 "The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. 48 But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
Luke 12:47–48

The expectations God has for us are thus in some ways conditional upon the resources we have been blessed with in this life. It can be hard for our limited human brains to fathom the complexities involved in evaluating human conduct in terms of individual circumstances and past experience — not to mention private motivations and intentions of the heart, and other such hidden things — but we can be confident that God is completely unerring in His Justice. No person will receive any more nor less than that which they truly deserve. (And of course it is not as if we have any ground to stand on in demanding recompense from God, as anything good we have accomplished in this body is ultimately through the power of the Spirit; compare Luke 17:10).
From pastor to church janitor, from well-educated privileged elite to inner-city gang escapee, all people are judged not on how they compare to other people with different circumstances, but on how they make use of the things actually given to them. This explains in part how the last can be first and the first can be last in the final reckoning of things.

The timing of judgements

The timing of judgement is different for different groups of believers. All believers before Christ’s second advent will be judged before the establishment of the Millennium (in fact, scripture teaches that some of the reward of Church age Christians will be related to positions within His perfect Millennial administration — see Revelation 2:26–27, and compare Luke 19:11–27). Millennial believers will be judged before the creation of the new heavens and earth — a different time. 

These respective judgements are described in more detail in Part 6 of the Coming Tribulation Series on Ichthys: Judgement of the Church, Judgement of Millennial believers. (While this topic is tangential to the topic at hand, you can also read about the timing and nature of the judgement of unbelievers in another section of this same study).













pages/legitimacy-of-reward-motivation-for-believers

- Greek of Hebrews 11:6 links drawing near to God to believing that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. Indirect statement with dual object: "believe that… and."
- Basically no clearer way to say that reward motivation is important than how things are put here.
- Hebrews 11:26 and Moses, in heroes of the faith section, Moses commended for looking towards his reward.


Ichthys quote:

In the context of the passage immediately above, 2nd Corinthians 5:10, we see Paul using this future judgment to motivate our behavior here and now: because this future judgment is the crowning event of our lives on earth (though it takes place after resurrection), we should "make it our [primary] ambition to please Him (i.e., our Lord Jesus Christ)" (v.9). For if we were to find ourselves standing before Him this instant, we would certainly realize more fully and deeply than we can presently imagine that all of the troubles and pleasures of this life had meaning only in so far as we overcame them in service to Him (or failed to do so). In fact, the word Paul uses to express what should be our goal or desire or mind-set is the Greek philotimeomai (φιλοτιμέομαι), meaning etymologically and essentially "to love honor/office/promotion". This verb is used throughout Greek literature to express the inner drive of highly motivated individuals to compete for the top honors in society, be it in politics, athletics or any other field. Individuals characterized in this way are "ambitious", that is, possessed of a burning desire for success in their respective fields of endeavor. As Paul says elsewhere (1Cor.9:25), non-Christians pour their all into their work, professions or pursuits "to win a perishable prize, but we do it to win an imperishable one".
