In this material world of ours, distinctions are made every day with regards to merit and distinguished service. While it is true that the idea of “everyone gets a trophy” has been gaining ground of late, it is nonetheless the case that most people do not seem to have great philosophical objection to the idea of different levels of recognition and reward for different levels of service.

When the topic is switched to eternal spiritual rewards for Christians, however, many people seem to have a much more visceral reaction. Perhaps it is because eternal rewards are, well, eternal. Perhaps it is because the idea of salvation coming by grace through faith and not by works is (rightly) highly emphasized as a core teaching, drilling into people a sort of distrust for any reward mentality. Or perhaps, sad as it is to say, some people resist this idea because, upon a bit of self-reflection, they realize that they will not be among the highly decorated if there are actually distinctions in eternal reward. Whatever the reasons, it has been my observation that while the teaching of eternal distinction in reward for Christians seems relatively straightforward in scripture, it is in practice a doctrine that many people have issues accepting. The goal of this page is to briefly put forward some of the scriptural evidence for the concept and deal with some common objections.

## A general overview of the teaching

Scripture is quite clear that upon Christ’s return, judgement will be rendered as to the works of men. For example:

{{% quote p="Matthew 16:27 | NIRV" %}}
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.
{{% /quote %}}

{{% quote p="2 Corinthians 5:10 | NIV84" %}}
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things *done* in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
{{% /quote %}}

{{% quote p="Revelation 22:12, NKJV"%}}
And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward *is* with Me, to give to every one according to his work.
{{% /quote %}}

All these passages speak of an evaluation of our works. It follows naturally that if some people have “better works” than others, then they will receive more reward — there is no other way to responsibly interpret these passages.

Paul gives us some more detail on the process of evaluation in 1 Corinthians 3:

{{% quote p="1 Corinthians 3:10-15" tsrc="https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part6.htm#1st%20Corinthians%203:10-15" %}}
**10** According to the grace of God given to me like a wise architect I have laid down a foundation, and another is building upon it. But let each one take care how he builds upon it. **11** For no one can lay another foundation except the One that has been laid down: Jesus Christ. **12** And if someone builds upon his foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones, [or] with wood, hay, and stubble, **13** [in either case] his work will be made manifest [as to its true quality], for the Day [of judgment] will make it clear [for what it truly is], because it will be revealed (lit., uncovered) with fire. And the fire will evaluate (lit., "assay") the work of each person as to what its [true] quality is. **14** If anyone's work which he has built [on his foundation of faith in Christ] remains (i.e., is not burnt away by the fiery evaluation), he will receive a reward [for it]. **15** If anyone's work is burnt up, he will suffer the loss [of any potential reward for it], but he himself will be saved – but in this way [just described] as through fire [which evaluated his false works as worthless and burnt them up].
{{% /quote %}}

After the fires of judgement, only those things we build upon the sure foundation of Jesus Christ will remain (words as well as actions, words being a subset in some sense of actions: compare Matthew 12:36–37). While the general principle of building upon the foundation of Christ is one thing, this passage also incontrovertibly teaches that some people — those who build with gold, silver, and precious stones rather than wood, hay, and stubble; those whose works are not consumed in the fire of evaluation — receive greater reward than others. 

Finally, consider the passages that teach that many of the last will be first and the first last:

{{% quote p="Mark 10:31" %}}
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
{{% /quote %}}

{{% quote p="Luke 13:30" %}}
Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.
{{% /quote %}}

These passages directly teach that there is ranking in heaven. If we were all the same in eternity, it would not be possible to have people who are first and last. QED. 


### The parable of the talents and the parable of the minas

These two parables also clearly teach that the level of our reward in eternity is dependent upon what we do here on Earth:

#### The parable of the talents

{{% quote p="Matthew 25:14-30, NKJV" %}}
**14** “For *the kingdom of heaven is* like a man traveling to a far country, *who* called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. **15** And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey. **16** Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. **17** And likewise he who *had received* two gained two more also. **18** But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord’s money. **19** After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.

**20** “So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them.’ **21** His lord said to him, ‘Well *done,* good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’ **22** He also who had received two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.’ **23** His lord said to him, ‘Well *done,* good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’

**24** “Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. **25** And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, *there* you have *what is* yours.’

**26** “But his lord answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. **27** So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. **28** So take the talent from him, and give *it* to him who has ten talents.

**29** ‘For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. **30** And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

#### The parable of the minas

{{% quote p="Luke 19:11-27, NKJV" %}}
**11** Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately. **12** Therefore He said: “A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. **13** So he called ten of his servants, delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business till I come.’ **14** But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We will not have this *man* to reign over us.’

**15** “And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. **16** Then came the first, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas.’ **17** And he said to him, ‘Well *done,* good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.’ **18** And the second came, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned five minas.’ **19** Likewise he said to him, ‘You also be over five cities.’

**20** “Then another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief. **21** For I feared you, because you are an austere man. You collect what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.’ **22** And he said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth I will judge you, *you* wicked servant. You knew that I was an austere man, collecting what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow. **23** Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?’

**24** “And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give *it* to him who has ten minas.’ **25** (But they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas.’) **26** ‘For I say to you, that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. **27** But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay *them* before me.’ ”

The parable of the talents (Matt.25:14-30), and the parable of the minas (Lk.19:11-27), though not identical in all details do teach the same principles. In both cases, the master or king represents our Lord, while we are represented by his servants. In each telling of this parable, the servants are given money belonging to their lord and commanded to make good use of it until he returns (with his return representing the Second Advent). The money given to (us) represents the means, opportunity, and authority (cf. Mk.13:34) to act for the Lord in His stead here on earth according to the gifts we have been given (*n.b.*, the English word "talent" actually comes from this parable). Talents and minas are both monetary units used throughout the ancient Mediterranean world from Babylon to Rome. Depending upon the specific standard employed, the approximate weight of a talent could range from some 60 to 100 pounds. At current rates for gold, therefore, a single talent might be worth as much as a million and half dollars in contemporary terms (although its buying power in the ancient economy where money was scarcer in relative terms would be significantly greater). A mina (or mna), was commonly one sixtieth of a talent and thus, while still very valuable, was worth considerably less (i.e., comparing the total value of the amounts given to the servants who received the talents to that given to the servants who each received a single mina equates roughly to eight million dollars versus twenty to thirty thousand dollars). The disparate range between these two similar parables indicates a similarly large range in the gifts and opportunities we are given, but the standard of judgment is the same in every case: our Lord expects a return on His investment, and will reward us wonderfully and marvelously in proportion to our efforts (i.e., the one whose mina gained ten more is placed over ten cities; the one whose mina gained five more is placed over five cities), but will do so with a reward that abundantly exceeds our results to an unimaginable degree (i.e., by the standards of the ancient world even more so than today, rulership over a city would be vastly more valuable than a single mina). For our purposes here, we see in both versions that the servants who accomplished the most are judged and rewarded first, and that the judgment continues in a descending order until it reaches the servant who accomplished nothing.

## How can differentiation in eternal rewards be reconciled with the parable of the vineyard workers? 

### The parable of the vineyard workers

{{% quote p="Matthew 20-16, NKJV" %}}
“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. **2** Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. **3** And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, **4** and said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went. **5** Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. **6** And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ **7** They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.’

8 “So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them *their* wages, beginning with the last to the first.’ 9 And when those came who *were hired* about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius. **10** But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius. **11** And when they had received *it,* they complained against the landowner, **12** saying, ‘These last *men* have worked *only* one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.’ **13** But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? **14** Take *what is* yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man *the same* as to you. **15** Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’ **16** So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.”

### Discussion

At first glance, this parable can seem to go against the point that we have repeatedly made above that eternal rewards are not all the same, instead being awarded proportionally based upon the actual measure of people’s dedication to the Lord in this life. After all, all the workers here receive the same wage, despite some doing much more work than others.

So what gives? Put simply this apparent contradiction comes from missing the fact the denarius in this parable refers to salvation rather than recompense for one’s labor for the Lord; the “pay” here is of a totally different character than the recompense from all passages above. The whole point of this parable is that we can’t work our way into heaven, because salvation is a gift of grace. Thus, the thief on the cross (compare Luke 23:39–43) will receive exactly the same salvation as a lifelong believer — a blissful eternity of fellowship with God and one another with no tears or pain (among other things) — despite believing only in his last moments of life.

(See also [a similar discussion of this parable from GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/parable-laborers-vineyard.html)).

There is no contradiction in God giving out salvation freely (on the basis of Christ’s sacrifice for us on the cross) while still rewarding believers for their above-and-beyond response to Him. He certainly wouldn’t have to to be just (for, as Luke 17:10 states, “we are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty,” and God does not in truth need anything from us), but all the passages above make it clear that God is so rich in kindness and grace that on top of saving us out of our sins by judging His one and only son in our place (i.e., freely giving us the denarius of salvation — even if we are workers in the last afternoon shift), He also gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our love for Him by working in faith to earn even higher levels of reward.

## TODO





God’s rewards are not zero-sum, so the only thing preventing everyone from achieving the highest level of eternal reward is themselves.

As the passage from 1 Corinthians 3 above states, some people really will be saved “as through fire,” with little more than this single denarius of salvation — given to them scandalously without true merit — to show for their time on earth. 



Are we all judged according to the same standard? 

This is a common question that pops up when talking about evaluation and reward. In many ways the answer to this question is yes and no.

In some sense, we are all equally called to perfection (compare Matthew 5:48). All of us are called to grow spiritually, pass the spiritual tests God puts before us to temper our faith, and then help others do likewise — and all spiritual rewards, no matter the person, are essentially based on these things (see the doctrine of the crowns/crowns of reward as described in Part 18 of the Peter Series on Ichthys and in a document from doctrines section of Bible Academy).

However, the exact way God evaluates us personally really does depend upon our individual circumstances, our pasts, the gifts and resources we possess, and a whole host of other factors too varied and complex to enumerate with any degree of specificity and/or comprehensiveness. Compare: 

47 “The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. 48 But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
Luke 12:47–48
The expectations God has for us are thus in some ways conditional upon the resources we have been blessed with in this life. It can be hard for our limited human brains to fathom the complexities involved in evaluating human conduct in terms of individual circumstances and past experience — not to mention private motivations and intentions of the heart, and other such hidden things — but we can be confident that God is completely unerring in His Justice. No person will receive any more nor less than that which they truly deserve. (And of course it is not as if we have any ground to stand on in demanding recompense from God, as anything good we have accomplished in this body is ultimately through the power of the Spirit; compare Luke 17:10).
From pastor to church janitor, from well-educated privileged elite to inner-city gang escapee, all people are judged not on how they compare to other people with different circumstances, but on how they make use of the things actually given to them. This explains in part how the last can be first and the first can be last in the final reckoning of things.

The timing of judgements

The timing of judgement is different for different groups of believers. All believers before Christ’s second advent will be judged before the establishment of the Millennium (in fact, scripture teaches that some of the reward of Church age Christians will be related to positions within His perfect Millennial administration — see Revelation 2:26–27, and compare Luke 19:11–27). Millennial believers will be judged before the creation of the new heavens and earth — a different time. 

These respective judgements are described in more detail in Part 6 of the Coming Tribulation Series on Ichthys: Judgement of the Church, Judgement of Millennial believers. (While this topic is tangential to the topic at hand, you can also read about the timing and nature of the judgement of unbelievers in another section of this same study).













pages/legitimacy-of-reward-motivation-for-believers
Greek of Hebrews 11:6 links drawing near to God to believing that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. Indirect statement with dual object: “believe that… and.”
Basically no clearer way to say that reward motivation is important than how things are put here.
Hebrews 11:26 and Moses, in heroes of the faith section, Moses commended for looking towards his reward.
In the context of the passage immediately above, 2nd Corinthians 5:10, we see Paul using this future judgment to motivate our behavior here and now: because this future judgment is the crowning event of our lives on earth (though it takes place after resurrection), we should "make it our [primary] ambition to please Him (i.e., our Lord Jesus Christ)" (v.9). For if we were to find ourselves standing before Him this instant, we would certainly realize more fully and deeply than we can presently imagine that all of the troubles and pleasures of this life had meaning only in so far as we overcame them in service to Him (or failed to do so). In fact, the word Paul uses to express what should be our goal or desire or mind-set is the Greek philotimeomai (φιλοτιμέομαι), meaning etymologically and essentially "to love honor/office/promotion". This verb is used throughout Greek literature to express the inner drive of highly motivated individuals to compete for the top honors in society, be it in politics, athletics or any other field. Individuals characterized in this way are "ambitious", that is, possessed of a burning desire for success in their respective fields of endeavor. As Paul says elsewhere (1Cor.9:25), non-Christians pour their all into their work, professions or pursuits "to win a perishable prize, but we do it to win an imperishable one".
