### Summary {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-summary}

When Jesus says that Jairus' daughter is "sleeping", and says that Lazarus (the brother of Mary and Martha) is "sleeping", well, why? Were they sleeping, or were they dead? Why would Jesus put things like this?

#### Q: If Jesus said they were sleeping, but they were dead, isn't there a contradiction? {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-q-if-jesus-said-they-were-sleeping-but-they-were-dead-isn-t-there-a-contradiction}

Hebrews 9:27 says that each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, but:

- In John 11:11 Jesus tells his disciples that Lazarus is sleeping, but then when they say that he will soon get better, then Jesus clarifies that he is dead.
- Also, in Matthew 9:24, Jesus says that the girl isn’t dead, she's only asleep, but in this case he doesn’t further clarify that she’s actually dead.

My question is why does he say that they’re sleeping instead of saying that they’re dead, and why does he clarify that Lazarus is dead but not the girl?

Also, in Luke 16 when Jesus tells about the rich man and Lazarus, he doesn’t mention sleeping: he says that they died.

Don't Hebrews 9:27 and Luke 16 go against the idea that they’re sleeping?

#### Answering point by point {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-answering-point-by-point}

There is a lot to unpack here! Some good questions.

I'm going to go piece by piece. This got rather long, but hopefully it will hit all the facets.

<!-- --- -->

##### First of all, the Lazarus of Luke 16 is not the same Lazarus as John 11 {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-first-of-all-the-lazarus-of-luke-16-is-not-the-same-lazarus-as-john-11}

Let's start with one of the easier things to address. Just like today, in antiquity, plenty of people shared names. So it is that we have:

- Mary the mother of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene (among other Mary's mentioned in the NT)
- John the Baptist (the Son of Elizabeth and Zechariah) and John the brother of James (who was one of the 12 Apostles)
- James the brother of Jesus (who wrote the book of James), James the brother of John (who was also one of the 12 Apostles, alongside his brother), and James the son of Alphaeus (yet another of the 12 Apostles)

One might go on. The point is, just like today, it was not all that uncommon for different people to have the same name. This can get confusing rather quickly.

<!-- --- -->

And so, of course, while it is completely reasonable to line up the two people named Lazarus, the shared name alone is not proof of them being the same person. In fact, there is some evidence to the contrary:

- In John 12:3, we are told that Lazarus' sister Mary anointed Jesus's feet with nard, an expensive type of perfume. Additionally, John 11:19 says "many Jews" came to comfort the sisters in the loss of their brother. From these verses and others, it is apparent that Mary, Martha, and Lazarus were relatively affluent and well-connected.
- But the Lazarus of Luke 16 is a beggar---perhaps the lowest social station possible.

So quite simply, from the Bible itself, it seems unlikely that these two men are the same person.

<!-- --- -->

I should also note that [some people think the account of Abraham and Lazarus in Luke 16 is just a parable](https://www.gotquestions.org/Luke-16-19-31-parable.html) (rather than a recounting of something that actually happened). It's a bit tangential, but I believe this to be decidedly wrong, as we are given no indication that this is merely a parable.

Here's what my mentor has to say on the subject:

{{% quote src="https://ichthys.com/mail-soul-sleep2.htm" text="Ichthys" %}}

Jesus most certainly does not say that it is a parable, although that is His practice when engaging in parables. Also, what other parable of our Lord's can you cite where historical people with definite names are employed? When Jesus is using a parable, the gospels generally say so. On the other hand, parables do not attribute definite historical actions to definite and precise historical people whom we know from elsewhere in the Bible as having done things they actually did not do. Finally, even were it a parable, that would still have to mean that the circumstances of the parable could not and would not teach theological error (cf. Mark 3:23-27 where Jesus' speaking "in parables" recounts an actual historical situation; Satan is certainly real and not a myth, nor is any of the information given there about the devil to be explained away).

##### Jesus' describing Lazarus as "sleeping" in John 11 {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-jesus-describing-lazarus-as-sleeping-in-john-11}

It is very clear from John 11 that Lazarus was dead; unlike in the Matthew 9 passage (which we will get to in a moment), there can be no doubt whatsoever here on the part of anyone. For in John 11:17, we hear that Lazarus had already been entombed for four days before Jesus arrived in Bethany.

So why then did Jesus employ the language of sleeping instead of death? Quite simply, he was speaking euphemistically. We still do this nowadays as well. For example, in English we might say someone "passed away" or "is no longer with us" or "went to be with Jesus" rather than bluntly saying that they died. But all of these things clearly are getting at the concept of death.

<!-- --- -->

An on-topic quote from my mentor:

{{% quote src="https://www.ichthys.com/mail-Sleep-as-Euphemism.htm" text="Ichthys" %}}

Now, to address the specifics of your question [about the false doctrine of so-called "soul sleep"], I believe that the major part of the issue (and indeed the essential grounds for the origin of it historically) is the use of the euphemism "sleep" for those who have died. A euphemism, of course, is a circumlocution or certain phraseology that is "more pleasant" or "less offensive" than giving something its most direct and abrupt name. This is why the veterinarian says, "I sorry to have to tell you that your cat 'has passed'", instead of saying "Your cat is dead". And if we feel compunctions about being direct in the case of the death of somebody's pet, how much more inappropriate would it be for us to say of someone's family member "He's dead." In fact, the use of euphemism is a Spirit-inspired device. Note for example the avoidance of direct terms for sexual and other biological functions in the Pentateuch. And in terms of death, our Lord's example will stand as one which cannot be denied. For He told the disciples, "Lazarus is sleeping", whereas He was being appropriately kind in using this standard biblical euphemism for death (Jn.11:11-15).

<!-- --- -->

All this is a long way of saying that when people in the Bible say "he/she is asleep", they often mean "he/she is dead", without there being any conclusion to be drawn from the nature of the euphemism about the current state of the individual – and rightly too, since we cannot actually see the person in heaven (or torments as the case may be). The problem of course is that in English we do not use the same idiom. Our euphemisms for death are numerous, but it is not our practice to say that a person is "asleep". In our cultural view, that would seem cruel (rather than kind) because it would seem to imply that they could be "awakened" when in fact of course they can no longer be (viewing things from our secular and materialistic perspective, at any rate). However, here we do see the superiority of the biblical idiom, for Jesus does say He is going to "wake up" Lazarus – and so He does! That, of course, was a miracle that has rarely been reproduced in the history of the world. But it does show that behind the word "sleep" used in the biblical euphemism for death, there lies the possibility of awakening – not of this physical body in its present corrupt state (aside from uncommon miracles as in the case of Lazarus), but of the body transformed in resurrection at the return of Jesus Christ. We see the promise latent in the euphemism "sleep" in Martha's words to the Lord: "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day", in response to Jesus' words "Your brother will rise again" (Jn.11:23-24). But please note that the word "rise", Greek *anistemi*, while it is the standard word for resurrection is also the standard word for getting up and waking up from sleep. So whether we are talking about genuine sleep, or miraculous resuscitation of the body as with Lazarus, or the actual resurrection and transformation of the body at our Lord's return, in all of these cases we have "sleep" followed by "rising". That is to say, unquestionably it is the body which sleeps and then rises. But when we die we are "out of [this] body and face to face with the Lord" (1Cor.5:6; cf. Phil.1:20-24). The euphemism of sleep is thus clearly and entirely directed to the body, not the spirit (the "soul", an unfortunate translation of the Hebrew *nephesh* and the Greek *pscyhe* is really where the two meet at present, "the heart"; see the link: ["The dichotomy of man"](https://ichthys.com/3A-Anthro.htm#4.%20The%20Dichotomy%20of%20Man)).

<!-- --- -->

Because we in our culture do not use sleep as a euphemism for death in the same way their culture did, it can be harder for us to pick up on this when we read English translations and "think from the English worldview", so to speak. But in fact, to properly grasp the meaning of the Bible, sometimes we must endeavor to put ourselves in the shoes of a first-century Hebrew-speaking person from Judea (for example), and then read the Bible from that perspective. You may hear this termed "culture-sensitive interpretation" or something of the sort. It's not that the truth ever changes or anything of the sort; rather, it is simply that we must "do our homework" when it comes to interpreting the Bible according to the audience to whom it was written.

And when we do that, hopefully it becomes clear why Jesus' words here are no contradiction. For we can see from John 11:13 that in saying "Lazarus sleeps" he had in fact very much meant in saying this that Lazarus was dead. That is quite literally what John 11:13 says!

##### Jesus' describing Jairus' daughter as "sleeping" in Matthew 9 {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-jesus-describing-jairus-daughter-as-sleeping-in-matthew-9}

This passage appears across the Synoptic gospels: Matthew 9:18-26; Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56. It can often be helpful to read all the gospels in parallel to see how the same events are described by the different writers.

Nonetheless, we'll limit ourselves to the Matthew account here, since with respect to this question of why Jesus said the girl was "sleeping", there isn't much difference.

First of all, some context:

- The people forming the crowd at Jairus' house were, in all likelihood, "professional mourners". The concept may seem a bit foreign to us in our time, but the idea is similar to hiring a pianist to play hymns at a loved one's funeral, or something of the sort.
- These people were, to put it somewhat crudely, "there for the money". They would have been hired to perform the culturally-expected funerary proceedings, which meant a lack of decorum on their part ought not shock us as if they were family members proper, sad as that is to say.

This is why these people mock Jesus' statement in Matthew 9:24. They would be thinking something along the lines of:

> We were just hired to do the funeral things for this girl, and now this joker shows up and says she's not even dead, but only asleep?! Puh-lease mister, gimme a break (\*eye roll\*). Just let us get back to work so we can collect our payment.

So this is the "setting of the scene" for this passage here in Matthew.

<!-- --- -->

###### It is not a euphemism this time, but something completely different {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-it-is-not-a-euphemism-this-time-but-something-completely-different}

It might be tempting to think Jesus was merely using sleep as a euphemism for death here too (just like in John 11), but there are some issues with taking that approach:

- First, as you are quite right in pointing out, Jesus never clarifies to say the girl was in fact dead. That would have been a very natural thing to do when the crowd began to mock him in verse 24. After all, if he really did mean in saying that the girl was sleeping that she was dead, why would he hide it then?
- Second, note that Jesus shoos the people away. He kicks them out of the house, and makes them wait outside. If there were nothing else going on here---and he were merely speaking euphemistically---then why would he do this?

So what *was* going on here, then?

<!-- --- -->

In my opinion, the best best way to interpret this passage is that Jesus knew full well that the girl was dead, but yet He said she was sleeping, and very intentionally never clarified whether it was a euphemism or not. (Culturally, as we have said, it was in fact a euphemism in common use, but people here would still have wondered if He was being literal or not, especially when the girl actually came walking out in short order). There are two reasons for this that I can see:

- Jesus (well, more specifically, his miracles) drew immense crowds. But people drawn in in by the "shiny things" and spectacle of it all would merely make it harder for Jesus to accomplish his ministry (culminating in the cross, where he paid for the sins of us all). The phenomenon can be clearly seen in, for example, Mark 1:40-45. You might also compare Matthew 9:30, Matthew 12:16, and so on. The basic idea is that Jesus, as a general rule, wanted to keep his miracles veiled and something decidedly less than shouted from the rooftops to avoid the celebrity of it all, since it interfered with the Father's Will for Him.
- Even aside from his own celebrity, consider the life this poor girl would lead if Jesus raised her from the dead in an unambiguous sort of way in front of a large crowd. Himself aside, it is quite likely that He avoided doing this to spare her and her family the sheer amount of interference this would cause in the rest of their lives.

<!-- --- -->

If Jesus insisted she was sleeping, sends everyone out, and then she appears a few minutes later, rumors take over and do the rest of the work. No doubt the girl and her family would receive some attention if people thought Jesus had miraculously healed her from very serious illness, but on the other hand, Jesus did that reasonably often with plenty of other people too. So after a time, the nosiness of others would die down, and they could live in peace. But if He unambiguously raised her from the dead in front of all? That's a wee bit more of a thing.

There are only two other instances of Jesus raising people from the dead aside from Jairus' daughter (this passage). One we've already talked about: the raising of Lazarus in John 11. The other is the widow of Nain's son in Luke 7:-11-17. One might fairly ask why then, if He might wish to avoid fame for himself and others as a matter of practicality (as I just argued for), did Jesus not try to play off these two as well (that is imply in some way that He was not actually raising people from the dead)? Some points:

- In the case of the widow of Nain's son, Jesus raised him during the funeral procession. No plausible deniability there, right? And so too with Lazarus, who had already been entombed for four days before Jesus got to Bethany, like we discussed above. So one obvious reason why Jesus didn't do some "they're only sleeping" business in these cases is because it would simply be impossible.
- Aside from that, there is also the fact that these were both adult men. Even with interfering busybodies (or worse) bothering them on account of the miracle, they would be capable of warding off anything problematic from them and their families (cf. John 12:10---this is no mere speculation on my part). But a young girl? Not so much. Especially given the relatively higher degree of vulnerability women were forced to contend with in antiquity.

<!-- --- -->

I will acknowledge that much of what I have just said is based on inference and a degree of speculation on my part (that is, it is not as if the Bible says these things very explicitly). However, I do believe this is more than just an opinion---I believe this is the actual truth of it, indirect as it may be. For I see little other explanation that satisfies all the elements at once without having other problems. Jesus sending the people out especially makes little sense under most other possible interpretations.

I should note that some people might be offended that this line of thinking suggests that Jesus intentionally misdirected the beliefs of others (critics would call it lying). To that I would ask what they think of the actions of the Hebrew midwives in Exodus 1:15-22 (and also what God thought about the actions of the midwives in that context), and also the actions of Rahab in Joshua 2 (and cf. the New Testament praise of Rahab's actions in Hebrews 11:31 and James 2:25). No doubt this teaching will ruffle some feathers, but part of growing up spiritually is learning to distinguish moral virtue from legalistic rules that have the appearance of holiness, but are in fact incompatible with true righteousness.

##### What of Hebrews 9:27? {#lazarus-and-jairus-daughter-are-they-sleeping-or-dead-what-of-hebrews-9-27}

If Hebrews 9:27 says that people die once, then what of Lazarus and Jairus' daughter? Aren't they dying twice?

Let me say, it gets even worse than just these two. What about the people mentioned in Matthew 27:50-53? Even more, if you take the two witnesses of Revelation (cf. Revelation 11:3-10) to be Moses and Elijah like I do (and there is a strong case for this, although that is ultimately a topic for a different time), then they will be walking around smiting bad guys with style some few thousand years after they last walked the Earth. Yet they are certainly said to be dead after the beast kills them (Revelation 11:7). So what gives?

It will probably make skeptics scoff, but there is death, and then there is *death*. Biblically speaking, there is a difference between "resuscitation" (as was the case for Lazarus and Jairus' daughter, and all the other examples also mentioned above), and "resurrection" (in the manner of 1 Corinthians 15). Dead people are resuscitated. *Dead* people are resurrected into their eternal bodies.

I'm sure that sounds all sorts of hand-wavy, but there it is. Put simply, all those who are resuscitated are not dead in the eternal sense of never again walking the earth in mortal bodies of fleshly corruption. From the human perspective, dead people are dead people. But with God's perfect foreknowledge and foreordination of all things, only those whom He does not foreknow as being resuscitated are positionally dead in the sense of being in the state they shall be in until Judgement Day. The two "types of dead" really are quite different, then, even if human beings can never tell the difference.

**Question #4:** 

Someone had asked if Lazarus (whom Jesus raised from the dead) had died twice, and if so, how does one reconcile that with this verse?

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 9:27 | KJV" %}}
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
{{% /scripture %}}

<!-- --- -->

**Response #4:**

Lazarus really was an unusual case - but not unprecedented: Jesus also raised the widow's son and the rich ruler's daughter, and Elijah and Elisha also will have what I would call a "resuscitation" to their credit during the Tribulation (Rev.11). Hebrews 9:27 was of course written in full knowledge of all these cases as Hebrews 11:35 makes clear: "[by faith] Women received back their dead, raised to life again" (and indeed, Paul himself resuscitated a young man who had fallen out of a window in Ephesus).

The way I would look at Hebrews 9:27, which does not contradict these miracles and is not ignorant of them, is that in all of these cases there was indeed still a ***final*** physical death. Therefore nothing can or could ever stand in the way of the coming "judgment" - save Christ being judged in our place. Thus the examples of those who were temporarily brought back to life actually ***confirm*** Hebrews 9:27, because even those who benefitted from the most amazing miracle of resuscitation from the dead could not even so avoid the appointment we all have with a final, ultimate end to the physical life of this corrupt body we now inhabit. Only through the resurrection by virtue of our faith in Him who is the Resurrection and the Life do we avoid the last judgment which leads to the second death and instead pass on to life eternal in Jesus Christ.

In Him with whom we shall live forever, the One who was judged for us, our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

**Question #3:** 

Concerning those who were raised momentarily in Matthew 27:53, how do we reconcile that with this Hebrews 9:27? How was it that these people had to die a 2nd death on this earth, although the Bible teaches us we die once.

{{% scripture p="Hebrews 9:27 | KJV" %}}
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
{{% /scripture %}}

<!-- --- -->

**Response #3:** 

This verse is certainly true for the vast majority of mankind. These ***very few*** people constitute an exception – although it's not much of an exception since, following resuscitation, they again fell into the same category of us all in regard to Hebrews 9:27, eventually facing a physical death from which there would be no more reprieve – and that is the real point of Hebrews 9:27, not that we don't have to die more than once, but that we are going to exit these corrupt physical bodies eventually and then face God's judgment – either the judgment of the righteous or the judgment of the unrighteous, depending on our attitude towards Jesus Christ in this life – ***and there is absolutely nothing we can do about these facts*** (so we best draw the right conclusions).

Certainly, the widow's son whom Elijah brought back, the Shunammite's son whom Elisha brought back, Tabitha, whom Peter brought back, and the boy who fell from the window in Ephesus whom Paul brought back are surely not around any more. By all indications they went on to live normal lives after being brought back from the dead, and then died physically as it is appointed. Whereas those who are resurrected can never die again (and there was nothing in any of these or similar cases to indicate that the physical, earthly body of these so resuscitated was changed in any way other than the miracle of resuscitation). There is also the even rarer case of transmutation. Enoch (and so far Elijah) did not meet with physical death in the normal way, yet they will be resurrected and appear before the judgment seat of Christ the same as we all will. Finally, Paul's statement in Hebrews 9:27 was made after all of the events discussed above, and from that point forward was, has been, and will continue to be true without further exceptions so far as we can tell from scripture.

In Jesus with who we shall live forever in the glory of eternal bodies that can never die.

#### Q: Does Jesus' use of the sleeping terminology have anything to to do with resuscitation? {#does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-do-with-resuscitation-q-does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-to-do-with-resuscitation}

Could the reason that Jesus used the sleeping terminology in John 11:11 and Matthew 9:24 have anything to do with the fact that these individuals would be resuscitated and wake up again? (As opposed to people who die but are not resuscitated)?

<!-- --- -->

#### Comments on our specific cases {#does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-do-with-resuscitation-comments-on-our-specific-cases}

I think Jesus' use of the sleeping terminology in John 11 and Matthew 9 is completely separate from his foreknowledge that these folks would be resuscitated rather than staying dead.

<!-- --- -->

##### Lazarus' case {#does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-do-with-resuscitation-lazarus-case}

In the case of Lazarus, the euphemism would be just as true in their culture if Lazarus never was resuscitated and stayed dead. That would be how the euphemism was mostly used in practice, after all, since it would be far more normal for people to stay dead than to be raised back to life.

<!-- --- -->

##### Jairus' daughter's case {#does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-do-with-resuscitation-jairus-daughter-s-case}

And in the case of Jairus' daughter, like I argued, even though she was actually dead and Jesus knew so, He said what he did (that is, took advantage of the euphemism people clearly knew culturally) to make things purposefully ambiguous to others, so that neither He nor the girl and her family would receive as much negative attention from it.

<!-- --- -->

##### The basic concept: sleeping is primarily associated with death, not resuscitation {#does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-do-with-resuscitation-the-basic-concept-sleeping-is-primarily-associated-with-death-not-resuscitation}

In neither case was his usage of this terminology really directly tied to the resuscitation, even though it turned up in both of these places. That is, I see the association of sleeping as being primarily with death, not resuscitation.

We also ought to note that there are places where sleeping is mentioned alongside death but not resuscitation (e.g., 1 Kings 2:10---"Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David"), and also places where resuscitation is mentioned but not sleeping (e.g., Paul's raising of Eutychus in Acts 20:7-12). These observations mean that we ought to understand the sleep references as being primarily associated with death, not resuscitation.

<!-- --- -->

#### More explanation about how sleeping and death are tightly linguistically coupled {#does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-do-with-resuscitation-more-explanation-about-how-sleeping-and-death-are-tightly-linguistically-coupled}

The verb for raising someone from death is the same as awakening/rousing someone from sleep in both Hebrew and Greek---see Hebrew's *qutz* ([קוּץ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6974/esv/wlc/0-1/)) and Greek's *egeiro* ([ἐγείρω](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1453/esv/mgnt/0-1/)), and the relevant concordance entries for this type of usage (that is, when the verbs are being used of death not sleep).

You might especially compare passages that clearly describe death as a perpetual sleep from which one does not awaken. For example:

- Jeremiah 51:39, 57;
- Job 14:12

Or passages that describe those that have been buried as sleeping in the ground:

- Daniel 12:2

So it's not just by accident that the verbs overlap in usage, but because of an enduring semantic relationship between the concepts, present in English as well (perhaps most commonly in poetic phrasing---cf. John Donne's famous Sonnet ["Death, be not proud"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44107/holy-sonnets-death-be-not-proud)), and actually most other languages too I'd reckon. Not that I've done a formal study of it, but it just makes sense for us humans to associate these two concepts that have similar surface appearances.

#### Q: How does the concept of resuscitation affect the afterlife? {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-q-how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife}

Since I'm unfamiliar with the concept of resuscitation vs. resurrection, I'd be happy to hear more about it generally, but I also have a specific question:

How does the concept of resuscitation affect the afterlife? Like where did Lazarus and Jairus’ daughter go when they died (considering that they were resuscitated and not resurrected)?

<!-- --- -->

#### On the nature and composition of human beings {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-on-the-nature-and-composition-of-human-beings}

Human beings are "dichotomous"---composed of two distinct parts. Those two parts are the body, and the spirit. There is no "third thing" (what they call in Lat*tertium quid*), even though this point is widely misunderstood, such that people often think that the concept of "soul" is distinct from body and spirit.

Biblically speaking, we do not "have" souls, but we ourselves *are* souls. That is to say, a soul is the combination of body and spirit together that makes us "us". The word translated as soul in Hebrew is *nephesh* ([נֶפֶשׁ](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5315.htm)), and in Greek it is *psukhe* ([ψυχή](https://biblehub.com/greek/5590.htm); cf. the English word psyche).

I am not a big fan at all of translating these Greek and Hebrew words with the English word "soul" due to all the problematic connotative baggage that term has picked up over the centuries. These Greek and Hebrew words can be better translated (as appropriate based upon context) with, for example, these other English words:

- Heart
- Mind
- Person
- Life (in the sense of "a human life"/"a living being")

You might compare hearing something along the lines of "When the ship went down, 200 souls were lost." What is meant in that statement is that 200 human beings/living persons drowned. Also, think about a statement like "He felt the sting of her words deep down in his soul." Couldn't we replace soul with heart there, and have exactly the same sense?

At any rate, the point is that humans are made up of body and spirit (two things), not body, spirit, and soul (three things).

<!-- --- -->

#### Types of death {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-types-of-death}

There are three "types of death" that human beings can experience:

- Physical death
- Spiritual death (spiritual separation from God)
- Eternal death (also called the "second death")---spending eternity in the Lake of Fire, eternally separated from God

When Satan told Eve that she would "surely not die" in Genesis 3:4, he spoke a half-truth. While disobeying God did not cause immediate physical death for Adam and Eve, their actions caused immediate spiritual death (spiritual separation from God), and in fact would cause eventual physical death... even if not instantaneously. Further, if God had not provided a gracious means of escape for us in the blood of Jesus Christ (symbolized and foreshadowed by God's gifting of the animal skins in Genesis 3:21, which is often called the *protoevangelium*), all of us---Adam and Eve included---would necessarily face certain eternal death as well.

Our present topic is focused upon the first type of death: physical death.

<!-- --- -->

#### Defining terms: physical death means someone's human spirit departs their physical body {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-defining-terms-physical-death-means-someone-s-human-spirit-departs-their-physical-body}

When someone dies physically, their human spirit leaves their physical body; they cease breathing. Wording things that way is in fact precisely the proper way to think about it since in both Hebrew (*ruach*, [רוּחַ](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7307.htm)) and Greek (*pneuma*, [πνεῦμα](https://biblehub.com/greek/4151.htm)), the exact same word is used for both spirit and breath. That is to say, the human spirit is present when breath is present, and not when not.

I should note that the fact that this identical duality in meaning is present across both languages is at least somewhat noteworthy. Hebrew and Greek are not at all linguistically related (Hebrew being a Semitic language, and Greek being an Indo-European language), so the fact that both languages have this same exact concept points to a universal spiritual truth. (One might also compare Latin's *spiritus*, which also has the same dual meanings, but contrast the two separate German nouns *geist* and *atem*, and the fact that we have two separate words in English too).

Regardless, the key takeaway point is that physical death is the removal of someone's human spirit from their physical body.

<!-- --- -->

#### What happens after that? {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-what-happens-after-that}

Finally, after all that groundwork, we are ready to start addressing the main thrust of the question. Put simply, what happens after physical death, and are things any different in the case of a person who will be resuscitated?

Let's start with the "normal" case, and explain the general mechanics of things.

<!-- --- -->

##### Before Christ's ascension vs. after Christ's ascension vs. in eternity proper {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-before-christ-s-ascension-vs-after-christ-s-ascension-vs-in-eternity-proper}

Discussing what happens after physical death for humans is complicated by the fact that it has not been constant throughout human history, and where/how we will spend eternity with God in the New Heavens and New Earth is yet again different.

Since some of these topics are ultimately a bit tangential to the present matter, I'm not going to spend too much time here, but a brief summary of the basics is in order.

###### "Heavenly geography" {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-heavenly-geography}

My mentor created a picture to describe what can be termed "heavenly geography":

![Heavenly Geography](https://ichthys.com/waters.gif)

<!-- --- -->

Some brief notes:

- The "Waters Above" and "Waters Below" separate the three main divisions from each other. Compare the "sea of glass" mentioned in Revelation 4:6 and Revelation 15:2.
- The Third Heaven is where the Father currently resides, separated from the world due to the tainting presence of sin in this current creation. This will no longer be the case (i.e., the Father will no longer be separated from us, but will dwell alongside us) when this current creation is destroyed and replaced with the New Heavens and New Earth at the end of history.
- The Kosmos (composed of the Earth and the *shamayim* = "heavens" plural = Earth's atmosphere and the wider universe) is where we currently dwell.
- Hades (or "Sheol" or "the Grave") is composed of further subdivisions:
  - "Abraham's Bosom", or paradise: the "good part" of Hades where pre-cross believers used to be located. (We'll talk more about that in a moment).
  - "Torments": the "bad part" of Hades where unbelievers go to await the Great White Throne Judgement at the end of history.
  - "The Abyss" or "Tartarus": where certain fallen angels are currently incarcerated on account of transgressing God's limitations put upon them (see 2 Peter 2:4, and cf. Jude 1:6).
  - "The Lake of Fire": where all unbelieving humans and angels will be cast for all eternity (although it is presently uninhabited, and will remain as such until that future point of irreversible judgement).

I should note that in English, we tend to be a bit loose with how we use the word "hell". In practice, sometimes people mean by it Torments (where unbelievers are before the Great White Throne Judgment at the end of history), and sometimes they mean the Lake of Fire (the final resting place of unbelievers in eternity). Those two places are technically distinct from one another, although neither is pleasant in the least.

<!-- --- -->

###### Before Christ's ascension {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-before-christ-s-ascension}

Before the [events described in Ephesians 4:7-10](https://ichthys.com/4A-Christo.htm#3%29_The_Transfer_of_Believers_from_the_Subterranean_Paradise_to_the_Third_Heaven) (Christ's ascension), pre-cross believers went to Hades, into the part of it known as "Abraham's Bosom". This is where Lazarus and Abraham are in Luke 16:19-31. As we mentioned before, Hades contains multiple subdivisions, including Abraham's Bosom and another section (called "Torments") where unbelieving humans go after death. The two sections are separated by a great chasm, such that nobody can cross between the two sections. (This is what Luke 16:26 is getting at).

Abraham's Bosom, though separate from the presence of the Father, was not some neutral or negative holding space or prison, but was a form of paradise (cf. Eden).

<!-- --- -->

###### After Christ's ascension {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-after-christ-s-ascension}

After the [events described in Ephesians 4:7-10](https://ichthys.com/4A-Christo.htm#3%29_The_Transfer_of_Believers_from_the_Subterranean_Paradise_to_the_Third_Heaven) (Christ's ascension), all of those who were previously in Abraham's Bosom were led by Christ into the presence of the Father in the Third Heaven. This is the victory Christ won for us on the cross: the veil of separation between us and God was completely and utterly split. When the Father accepted Christ's payment for our sins, death was defeated, and God now sees believing humans only through the blood of Christ. Therefore, since then, when believers die, they join all of our previously-departed brothers and sisters in the Third Heaven, where our ancient forebears were led after Christ's ascension.

Unbelievers still go to Torments in Hades, however. That part has stayed consistent.

<!-- --- -->

###### In eternity proper {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-in-eternity-proper}

There is described in Revelation a period of 1,000 literal years known as the Millennium, wherein Christ will rule from Jerusalem in this present creation. It will be a time of overflowing peace and prosperity like no other time before.

But eternity proper is different from the Millennium. At the end of history, this current creation will be destroyed (Cf. Psalm 102:26; Isaiah 13:13; Isaiah 34:4; Isaiah 51:6; Matthew 24:35; Revelation 6:14; Revelation 20:11). Then God will create the New Heavens and New Earth, the New Jerusalem will descend, and we will dwell there in perfect bliss for all eternity (with no more tears, no more pain, and perfect fellowship with not only each other, but also elect angels and God).

That is the eternal state of believers and elect angels. By way of contrast, unbelievers will find themselves thrown into the Lake of Fire for all eternity, alongside Satan and the other fallen angels.

<!-- --- -->

##### Wait, is it just human spirits in these places? But what about resurrection bodies? {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-wait-is-it-just-human-spirits-in-these-places-but-what-about-resurrection-bodies}

Unfortunately, a lot of "pop culture" representations of heaven involve pearly gates, clouds, floating gold streets, and what have you---things that make it seem somehow floaty and ephemeral rather than physical. This is not compatible with the Bible's descriptions of the afterlife.

The Bible is clear that in final resurrection we will be "like" Christ (1 John 3:2, and cf. 1 Corinthians 15:35-58), and will dwell upon the remade Earth (now free from sin and death) rather than up in the clouds somewhere. We will have bodies that are incorruptible, "spiritual bodies" that will be ruled over by spiritual impulses rather than the sinful fleshly ones like we have at present. We can only grasp the barest outlines of exactly what this means, but the key point is that our spirits will still be housed in bodies, even if they are different than the ones we are now in.

So what about before the resurrection, we might ask? Did the people in Abraham's Bosom have bodies of some form? What about those in the Third Heaven now?

<!-- --- -->

###### Interim bodies {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-interim-bodies}

The answer to these questions is yes---people in the afterlife (even before the resurrection) have bodies too. Recall at the beginning of today's video how we talked about the composition of humans---how we are composed of body and spirit. How could humans exist as only spirit? It is simply not how God has made us, ontologically speaking.

Clothing is a metaphor employed in the Bible for the concept of human spirits being joined with physical bodies (cf. 2 Corinthians 5:1-4; Revelation 6:11, 7:9). For a human to be, well, a human, a human spirit must be embodied and joined with some form of "vessel" = a physical body.

Scripture therefore indirectly teaches a concept that my mentor has termed "interim bodies". This is the idea that after we die physically but before the resurrection, human spirits of departed believers (in Abraham's Bosom before, and now in the Third Heaven) are clothed by God in temporary bodies. Bodies of this sort are both distinct from the sort of body we possess in this life (that is, a fleshly body infested with sin), and the sort of resurrection body (like Christ's) we shall eventually possess (the so-called "spiritual body", or *soma pneumatikon*, of 1 Corinthians 15:44).

<!-- --- -->

One of the reasons why this teaching is often missed or misunderstood is because of [a complex textual issue relating to 2 Corinthians 5:3](https://ichthys.com/mail-Resurrection-Body-Eternal-Future.htm#interim%20body%20taught%20in%202nd%20Corinthians%205:3). Textual criticism is the art and science of figuring out what the original text of the Bible said; since the Bible was copied and recopied many times over the decades and centuries, changes could creep in and corrupt the text. The exact specifics of this particular textual matter are a bit beyond what I want to get into here (although see the link if interested in the gory technical details), but suffice it to say that the proper way to translate 2 Corinthians 5:3 is actually along the lines of "when we are **un**-clothed (i.e., because we have died, and our spirits have left our physical bodies), we will not be found naked (i.e., God will clothe our spirits with some new body)" rather than "when we are clothed (i.e., joined with a body of some form), we will not be found naked (i.e., we will not end up being disembodied)". Note that the meaning is entirely flipped between those two options, and also note the nearly tautological sense of the second (incorrect) option.

To put that into a bit plainer English: 2 Corinthians 5:3---when translated using the correct textual base---says that when we put off our present bodies when we die physically, we will not be found naked in the sense of being without a body for our human spirit. Ergo, interim bodies.

There is other evidence too:

- In Luke 16:19-31, do disembodied spirits have tongues that experience heat (Luke 16:24)? How could one recognize Abraham, Lazarus, and the rich man if they were merely disembodied spirits when in Hades?
- Compare again those verses from Revelation that mention the white robes: Revelation 6:11, 7:9. Do disembodied spirits have robes? But they couldn't be resurrection bodies there either, since the resurrection hasn't yet occurred.
- Etc.

<!-- --- -->

I should be clear that there is very much here we do not know. For example, a quote from my mentor:

{{% quote src="https://ichthys.com/mail-interim%20state.htm" text="Ichthys" %}}
We have very little to go on when it comes to the constitution of the interim body (just the passages I have cited previously [that is, 2 Corinthians 5:3; Revelation 6:11, 7:9]). Revelation calls it a "white sheet to wear"; 2nd Corinthians also uses the clothing analogy saying that we "won't be found naked"; and in Luke 16 both those in paradise and those in torments are recognizable, can speak, reason, and seemingly function in most important ways just as we presently can. Were I to speculate, I would say that the materiality or physicality of the interim body is less pronounced than for either of the other two. We know that we can eat in both the natural and resurrection bodies (cf. Lk.24:40-43), but there is neither need nor (probably) opportunity to eat in the interim state (whether it be the paradise of the past or the third heaven of the present), and I would imagine that this is true of much of the physical interaction which is commonplace now and will be after the resurrection again. Then again, the rich man asks Abraham to have Lazarus dip the tip of his finger into water to cool his tongue - it doesn't happen, of course, but it may be that he was observing eating in drinking across the "great fixed gulf" (I can't say for sure).

##### So answering that question of "what happens after physical death, in the normal case?" {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-so-answering-that-question-of-what-happens-after-physical-death-in-the-normal-case}

Assuming we are talking about a believer:

- Before Christ's ascension, they would have ended up in Abraham's Bosom in Hades, in an interim body.
- After Christ's ascension, they will end up in the Third Heaven, in an interim body.

And then after the resurrection, each person shall possess a resurrection body, just like Christ's body after he was resurrected. The *soma pneumatikon* of 1 Corinthians 15:44.

<!-- --- -->

#### And what about for those who are resuscitated? {#how-does-the-concept-of-resuscitation-affect-the-afterlife-and-what-about-for-those-who-are-resuscitated}

Put simply, matters of the afterlife are no different when it comes to those people who are resuscitated, except they go backwards from the interim body state to the physical world in addition to the normal forward version of that passage, whereas others only ever make that transition in the forwards direction alone. Once they make the transition the second time (i.e., die for the second time after being resuscitated), it is as if there were nothing irregular about their afterlife experience at all.

That is to say, when Jairus' daughter died the first time (assuming for the sake of argument she met the standards of belief necessary for salvation at the time of Matthew 9), she would have found herself in Abraham's Bosom in an interim body, until her human spirit was called back to her physical body here in the world, at which point the interim body in Abraham's Bosom would have no longer been necessary. But then, after she lived out the remainder of her days, she would once again have died physically, and if she was still a believer, she would have again found herself in an interim body (although probably now in the Third Heaven, since she would have likely died long after Jesus had ascended, since she was so young at the time of His ministry).

#### Q: Could you explain more how all this works with respect to the finality of death? {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-q-could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death}

In Luke 16, a chasm is described as separating the two parts of Hades (such that no one on either side can cross over). Also, Hebrews 9:27 says that each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment.

So how does the concept of resuscitation affect the finality of death? It seems to me like Luke 16 and Hebrews 9:27 describe death as final, but then these people die twice...? What gives?

<!-- --- -->

#### Luke 16 - on the chasm of separation {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-luke-16-on-the-chasm-of-separation}

See our [previous video](TODO) for more on "heavenly geography", and the subdivisions of Hades.

I am not entirely sure what bearing the chasm mentioned in Luke 16:26 has on the finality of death, as you see things, but assuming you take its mention to be something along the lines of "there exists not only an uncrossable separation between Abrahm's Bosom and Torments in Hades, but also between Hades and our world", well that is very true. Those in the afterlife are "contained", if you want to look at things that way, but looking at things from the other direction, so are we. We cannot cross over there any more than they can cross over here.

In fact, the unyielding nature of this separating boundary between life in the world and death in the underworld has always been a major theme in mythological systems. Consider the story of [Orpheus and Eurydice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_and_Eurydice) in Greek myth, for example.

If the conceptual hang-up is that in resuscitation people once in Hades somehow exit and traverse the boundary said to be so vast and uncrossable, well resurrection poses just as much a problem in this regard as resuscitation, does it not? And *that* is certainly completely central to our faith (as Paul argues most eloquently in 1 Corinthians 15:16-19). Christianity does not "work" without the resurrection of the dead.

So what to make of this? How do we puzzle it out? The key point is that in resurrection and resuscitation both, it is not humans that do the crossing of the uncrossable boundaries on our own, but God that causes it to happen. Compare Matthew 19:26.

<!-- --- -->

I also don't think we should lose sight of the fact that raising people from the dead (resuscitation) was clearly recognized as being utterly miraculous. It is *not* normal, but completely extraordinary---that's the whole point! So far from arguing "well, resuscitation can't actually be a thing, because it would mean that dead people have to cross an uncrossable boundary", we should instead be emphasizing how awe-inspiring it is that God, out of His overflowing grace and mercy and love, actually Himself violates the natural order He has set up, for our benefit!

This reminds me in some respects of people struggling with exactly how the divine nature of Jesus Christ could possibly come to be bound to a physical body in the incarnation. It is fine to wonder and ponder and meditate upon (for it is certainly not easy to metabolize), but past a certain point, the important thing is that God *did* send His one and only Son into the world to take on humanity and die for our sins, so that we might be reconciled to Him. Shouldn't we focus on the wonder and awe of that, rather than focusing on raising objections to the "logic" of it, so to speak?

That's not meant to be a rebuke or anything, by the way. We just need to be sure to keep our focus upon what is truly important, and not let ourselves get tripped up by trying to apply human logic to God... who is decidedly *not* bound in the ways that we are as humans. God created the Universe in the blink of an eye; He can do whatever He pleases within it. Even things that are completely impossible from the human perspective.

<!-- --- -->

#### Hebrews 9:27 - Perhaps speaking in terms of "types of death" was a poor choice on my part {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-hebrews-9-27-perhaps-speaking-in-terms-of-types-of-death-was-a-poor-choice-on-my-part}

I'm afraid in the prior video [when I discussed Hebrews 9:27](), I was not as clear I should have been. I spoke in terms of of a type of death leading to resuscitation, and a type of death leading to resurrection/judgment. I argued that Hebrews 9:27 is referring to the second kind and not the first kind, and that while human beings cannot know the difference between the two states (that is, whether someone who has died will come back or not), God does, based upon his perfect foreknowledge and foreordination of everything.

While I don't think there is anything technically wrong with what I said, perhaps this is not actually the ideal framework for trying to explain the concept, now that I think about it. Since it's not so much that the "dying" is different (so to speak), so much as what comes after it. That is, the difference comes from the following condition of the human being's existence more than it comes from how they left the physical world the first time around.

So, for example, if Jairus' daughter died of illness (as is likely, given that she was only about 12 years old per Luke 8:42, and the text gives us no reason to think it was anything different), then her death from illness was no different than that of someone who would not ultimately be resuscitated. There was nothing special about this part, *per se*. What was special came only afterwards: that someone who was once dead (well and truly dead, not merely asleep) once again had life. *That* is the special thing---the miracle---not the "type of death".

What I had been trying to get at before was that there is a sort of death after which one stays dead, and that is true of all humans, even those who were resuscitated in the interim. Permanent physical death eventually comes for us all, and cannot be avoided by anyone.

<!-- --- -->

#### A better way to talk about it, perhaps: focusing on the vocabulary and context of Hebrews 9:27 more {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-a-better-way-to-talk-about-it-perhaps-focusing-on-the-vocabulary-and-context-of-hebrews-9-27-more}

This will be a bit detailed and technical, which is sort of why I hadn't done the deep dive the first time around. However, I do hope it will help you make sense of Hebrews 9:27 better, despite the complexity.

<!-- --- -->

##### Hebrew 9:27's wider context {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-hebrew-9-27-s-wider-context}

Leaving aside a wider thematic analysis of the entire book of Hebrews (although see [here](https://ichthys.com/Hebrews-Home-Page.htm)), chapter 9 specifically of Hebrews can be broken down as follows:

Hebrews 9:1-15 contrasts the sacrifices of the Earthly Sanctuary with the sacrifice (singular) of Christ in the Heavenly Sanctuary. The sacrifices in the Earthly Sanctuary cleansed only the outside, but the blood of Christ won for Him entrance into the Heavenly Most Holy Place once for all (verse 12), and allows us to cleanse not only our exteriors, but also our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God (verse 14). We are now under a new covenant (verse 15).

Hebrews 9:16-24 speaks of the role of blood in covenants. We are told that these sorts of covenants are sealed with blood (verses 16-18). Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness (verse 22). In the prior sacrifices, the earthly tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies had to be cleansed with the blood of calves (verse 21), but the heavenly things had to be purified with better sacrifices than these (verse 23). For the blood of Christ was not payment to enter a sanctuary made with human hands, but rather payment to enter heaven itself (verse 24).

Hebrews 9:25-28 makes it clear that unlike the prior ritual sacrifices that had to be offered again and again, Christ does not enter heaven to offer himself repeatedly, since "He appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself" (verse 26). When He returns again, it will not be to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him (verse 28).

<!-- --- -->

##### The Greek adverb *hapax* {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-the-greek-adverb-hapax}

To better explain the "once" in Hebrews 9:27---part of the wider statement "people are destined to die once"---we will primarily be focusing in on the last few verses of the chapter (Hebrews 9:25-28), and even more specifically, the usage of the Greek adverb *hapax* ([ἅπαξ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g530/esv/mgnt/0-1/)), which is the Greek word that many versions translate as "once" here.

Put simply, sometimes this adverb can be used in the sense of "one time, as opposed to more times", but sometimes it also takes on the meaning "once for all". This second meaning has overtones of completion and finality: in this case, the adverb is modifying something that has been rendered done in such a way that it will be perpetually valid, and never need repetition.

So, for example, contrast these uses:

- Last month I crashed my car once (i.e., one time, as opposed to more times) when someone cut me off in traffic. Thankfully, the damage from that accident was quite minor, but then I dented the bumper again yesterday when the power steering suddenly stopped working when I was backing up!
- Unlike normal people, Johnny only ever seems to total cars when he crashes them. While the rest of us get into fender-benders occasionally, Johnny crashes a car once (i.e., once for all), and then that's it; the car will inevitably be toast after that. This is why Johnny's car insurance rates are sky high.

See the difference? I quite like the analogy of a single fender-bender (the "single time" meaning) vs. totaling a car completely (the "once for all" meaning), as I think it illustrates the differing concepts well.

Before we look at how *hapax* is used in Hebrews 9 specifically, let's look at a couple other examples from scripture to make sure we understand the difference between these two meanings of *hapax*.

2 Corinthians 11:25 is a good example of a verse where the sense of the *hapax* is most certainly "one time, as opposed to more times" rather than "once for all". Since why would Paul be beaten with rods three times, shipwrecked three times, but then be stoned once for all rather than stoned one time? Contextually, that would make no sense.

Jude 1:3 is a good example of a verse where the sense of the *hapax* is most certainly "once for all" rather than "one time, as opposed to more times". Since how could the faith be delivered unto the saints multiple times? What would that even mean?

##### The Greek adverb *hapax* in Hebrews 9 {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-the-greek-adverb-hapax-in-hebrews-9}

In Hebrews 9, the Greek adverb *hapax* shows up in verses 7, 26, 27, and 28.

As in all translation, we determine how to translate primarily based upon context. In Hebrews 9:7, we must translate the *hapax* as "one time" rather "once for all" because Hebrews 9:25 says that the high priest entered the inner room every year (Greek: κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν), not just one time and then never again.

In Hebrew's 9:26, we ought to translate that *hapax* as "once for all", since it is obviously being contrasted with the "often" or "frequently" (Greek: [πολλάκις](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4178/esv/mgnt/0-1/)) of Hebrews 9:25. So too in Hebrews 9:28---the sense is still clearly contrasting the effectiveness and finality of Christ's sacrifice with the feebleness of the repeated sacrifices of the Law.

This means the *hapax* of Hebrews 9:27 is set directly parallel with the "once for all" usage of Hebrews 9:28. In fact, the verses begin with with "**27** καὶ καθ᾽ ὅσον... **28** οὕτως καὶ", which translates to something like "**27** and just as... **28** so also". We thus conclude that the sense of the *hapax* in Hebrews 9:27 *must* be "once for all" rather than being "one time".

###### The importance of the "once for all" concept as it pertains to Christ's work completely forces our hand in translating Hebrews 9:26, 28 {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-the-importance-of-the-once-for-all-concept-as-it-pertains-to-christ-s-work-completely-forces-our-hand-in-translating-hebrews-9-26-28}

This latter part of Hebrews 9 is not the only place the finality and completeness of Christ's work is clearly emphasized in scripture. For example, see:

- 1 Peter 3:18
- Romans 6:10
- Hebrews 7:27
- Hebrews 9:12
- Hebrews 10:10

1 Peter 3:18 is using *hapax*, but the rest are actually using the Greek adverb *ephapax* ([ἐφάπαξ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2178/esv/mgnt/0-1/)). This different word has two meanings:

- "At once" in the sense of "at the same time" (you can see this usage in 1 Corinthians 15:6).
- "Once for all", just like *hapax*.

That second meaning of *ephapax* is in view in Hebrews 9:12. Even though this verse is using this different adverb in Greek, it means the same thing as the *hapax* in Hebrews 9:26, 27, 28. I just hadn't mentioned before in our discussion of *hapax* in Hebrews 9 since it is in fact a different word.

At any rate, all of this is to show how it is irresponsible to take Hebrews 9:26 and Hebrews 9:28 as anything other than "once for all". We *must* translate that way, if we care at all about interpreting scripture with scripture, as we should.

And if the *hapax* Hebrews 9:28 must be translated as "once for all", then so too must the *hapax* in Hebrews 9:27, as we covered just previously.

###### So Hebrews 9:27 does not contradict the idea of resuscitation, QED {#could-you-explain-more-how-all-this-works-with-respect-to-the-finality-of-death-so-hebrews-9-27-does-not-contradict-the-idea-of-resuscitation-qed}

The reason why all this is important is as follows:

- If the *hapax* in Hebrews 9:27 means "one time", any cases of resuscitation would contradict this verse. Since then those people die not one time, but more than one time.
- But if the *hapax* in Hebrews 9:27 means "once for all", then there is no contradiction whatsoever. Because it is a true statement that all humans die once for all (since even those people who are brought back to life for a time will still face eventual permanent physical death), then Hebrews 9:27 does not contradict the idea of resuscitation in the least.
