## Summary {#summary}

Does it mean anything that both Lazarus and Jairus' daughter came back to life after Jesus said they were "sleeping?" Does "sleeping" necessarily predict eventual resuscitation? The answer to this question is no. Sleep as a metaphor/euphemism is more linked with death than resuscitation, and other evidence from the Bible helps us show that the normal way to take things is actually that those who are "sleeping" are dead. That these two specific individuals happened to be resuscitated does not change the fact that the metaphorical/euphemistic usage of sleep is linked to death, not resuscitation.

### Q: Does Jesus' use of the sleeping terminology have anything to to do with resuscitation? {#q-does-jesus-use-of-the-sleeping-terminology-have-anything-to-to-do-with-resuscitation}

Could the reason that Jesus used the sleeping terminology in John 11:11 and Matthew 9:24 have anything to do with the fact that these individuals would be resuscitated and wake up again? (As opposed to people who die but are not resuscitated)?

<!-- --- -->

### Comments on our specific cases {#comments-on-our-specific-cases}

I think Jesus' use of the sleeping terminology in John 11 and Matthew 9 is completely separate from his foreknowledge that these folks would be resuscitated rather than staying dead.

<!-- --- -->

#### Lazarus' case {#lazarus-case}

In the case of Lazarus, the euphemism would be just as true in their culture if Lazarus never was resuscitated and stayed dead. That would be how the euphemism was mostly used in practice, after all, since it would be far more normal for people to stay dead than to be raised back to life.

<!-- --- -->

#### Jairus' daughter's case {#jairus-daughter-s-case}

And in the case of Jairus' daughter, like I argued, even though she was actually dead and Jesus knew so, He said what he did (that is, took advantage of the euphemism people clearly knew culturally) to make things purposefully ambiguous to others, so that neither He nor the girl and her family would receive as much negative attention from it.

<!-- --- -->

#### The basic concept: sleeping is primarily associated with death, not resuscitation {#the-basic-concept-sleeping-is-primarily-associated-with-death-not-resuscitation}

<!-- p="1 Kings 2:10; Acts 20:7-12" -->

In neither case was his usage of this terminology really directly tied to the resuscitation, even though it turned up in both of these places. That is, I see the association of sleeping as being primarily with death, not resuscitation.

We also ought to note that there are places where sleeping is mentioned alongside death but not resuscitation (e.g., 1 Kings 2:10---"Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David"), and also places where resuscitation is mentioned but not sleeping (e.g., Paul's raising of Eutychus in Acts 20:7-12). These observations mean that we ought to understand the sleep references as being primarily associated with death, not resuscitation.

<!-- --- -->

### More explanation about how sleeping and death are tightly linguistically coupled {#more-explanation-about-how-sleeping-and-death-are-tightly-linguistically-coupled}

{{< /subjects >}}
<!-- p="Jeremiah 51:39; Jeremiah 51:57; Job 14:12; Daniel 12:2" -->

The verb for raising someone from death is the same as awakening/rousing someone from sleep in both Hebrew and Greek---see Hebrew's *qutz* ([קוּץ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6974/esv/wlc/0-1/)) and Greek's *egeiro* ([ἐγείρω](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1453/esv/mgnt/0-1/)), and the relevant concordance entries for this type of usage (that is, when the verbs are being used of death not sleep).

You might especially compare passages that clearly describe death as a perpetual sleep from which one does not awaken. For example:

- Jeremiah 51:39, 57;
- Job 14:12

Or passages that describe those that have been buried as sleeping in the ground:

- Daniel 12:2

So it's not just by accident that the verbs overlap in usage, but because of an enduring semantic relationship between the concepts, present in English as well (perhaps most commonly in poetic phrasing---cf. John Donne's famous Sonnet ["Death, be not proud"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44107/holy-sonnets-death-be-not-proud)), and actually most other languages too I'd reckon. Not that I've done a formal study of it, but it just makes sense for us humans to associate these two concepts that have similar surface appearances.

## Video/audio transcript {#video-audio-transcript}

{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - hey guys so tonight we're going to be doing a follow-on video to a previous one we did talking about Jesus's use of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="7" display="00:07" %}} - sleeping terminology in John chapter 11 and Matthew chapter 9 and now we're just going to be looking at a couple things  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="13" display="00:13" %}} - in a bit more detail so here are the topics that we're going to be going over here uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="19" display="00:19" %}} - follow on question that we're going to be talking about is does Jesus's use of the sleeping terminology have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="26" display="00:26" %}} - to do with resuscitation so basically is he using uh the word sleep rather than death simply because we know that these  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="34" display="00:34" %}} - people will be resuscitated and we're going to talk about the two cases that we've already been focusing on so  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="39" display="00:39" %}} - lazarus's case in John chapter 11 and gyrus daughter's case in Matthew chapter 9 and uh we're going to argue that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="47" display="00:47" %}} - sleeping is actually primarily associated with death not resuscitation so the answer to this particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="53" display="00:53" %}} - question is no not really um Jesus is using sleep as a euphemism for death and then taking advantage of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="60" display="01:00" %}} - associations there rather than really it having very much to do with resuscitation directly and then we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="65" display="01:05" %}} - just going to talk a little bit about that linguistic connection between death and sleep and so this isn't just Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="71" display="01:11" %}} - and Hebrew this is sort of most languages in fact kind of have a tie between these two concepts and that kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="77" display="01:17" %}} - of explains why Jesus uses death for or sorry sleep for death in these cases as well so it's kind of nothing out of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="84" display="01:24" %}} - ordinary we would say okay so first thing just going over that question again in a little bit more  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="94" display="01:34" %}} - detail here um we're just going to pose it as this could the reason that Jesus used sleeping terminology in John  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="103" display="01:43" %}} - chapter 11 and Matthew chapter 9 so that is with Lazarus and gyrus his daughter have anything to do with the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="110" display="01:50" %}} - these individuals would be resuscitated and wake up again as opposed to people who die but are not resuscitated and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="117" display="01:57" %}} - the idea here behind this question is sort of of if Jesus knew that these people would wake up and we know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="125" display="02:05" %}} - people from sleep wake up then maybe that's why he would use the word sleep here instead of death like it could be  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="131" display="02:11" %}} - sort of foreshadowing if you will the idea that these people would uh be raised from the dead resuscitated come  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="138" display="02:18" %}} - back to life in a way that most people who die are not and so could Jesus have been using this uh sort of to say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="146" display="02:26" %}} - no these people aren't Dead uh they are going to come back to life as sort of a a like a word choice to reflect that for  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="155" display="02:35" %}} - knowledge um and so could that be why Jesus used this terminology of sleeping rather than just coming right out and  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="163" display="02:43" %}} - saying directly that they were dead and so the short answer to this question is I really don't think this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="172" display="02:52" %}} - the case I think Jesus's use of the sleeping terminology in John 11 and Matthew chapter 9 is actually completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="180" display="03:00" %}} - separate from his foreign knowledge that these folks would be resuscitated rather than staying dead so Jesus obviously  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="186" display="03:06" %}} - knew that he was going to raise them from the dead but I don't think that he was using this terminology of sleep  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="192" display="03:12" %}} - rather than death uh just because he knew that they would be resuscitated I think he's using it as we shall see just  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="200" display="03:20" %}} - because that is such a a common Association uh between these words between sleep and death so in Greek and  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="207" display="03:27" %}} - Hebrew and English in most other languages too presumably that he's using this because sleep is so tightly coupled  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="213" display="03:33" %}} - with death and it really doesn't have very much to do with resuscitation on the whole of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="221" display="03:41" %}} - it so in the case of Lazarus in John chapter 11 the euphemism uh that is using sleep as a euphemism for death  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="231" display="03:51" %}} - well it would actually be just as true in their culture if Lazarus was never resuscitated and stayed dead that is as  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="238" display="03:58" %}} - we went over in the previous video we know that um perhaps in the Hebrew culture at the time in which Jesus was  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="245" display="04:05" %}} - around they had this association between sleep and death kind of in a way that we don't so much in English it's not that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="252" display="04:12" %}} - that is never used as an association but it's just probably not as common in our everyday speech as it was for them as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="259" display="04:19" %}} - a euphemism so you know we say things like someone passed away um and things like that but for them this was a pretty  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="266" display="04:26" %}} - common euphemism for death and so the point I'm making here is that most of the time when people use this euphemism  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="274" display="04:34" %}} - the person who they were using it of they they didn't come back to life so in fact this is kind of an atypical case  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="282" display="04:42" %}} - because mostly when people said that they meant that someone is dead like is in very dead and not coming back and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="288" display="04:48" %}} - it would kind of almost undercut the exact question we're asking here of would Jesus used this specifically to  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="295" display="04:55" %}} - foreshadow or uh kind of make it clear that these people were going to be awakened from their quote unquote sleep  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="302" display="05:02" %}} - the answer is kind of no because the very fact that he uses this the very fact that it's a thing in their culture  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="308" display="05:08" %}} - that Association like 99.9% of the time doesn't refer to people who are resuscitated because you know across the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="317" display="05:17" %}} - entire biblical narrative there aren't very many people who are ever raised from the dead um so Jesus it wasn't just  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="322" display="05:22" %}} - Lazarus and Gus's daughter there was the Widow's son um a widow of of nine in in uh forget where exactly that is I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="332" display="05:32" %}} - it's in Luke Luke chapter 7 I want to say um we went over that in the previous video but there really aren't very many  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="337" display="05:37" %}} - instances of this so for the most part culturally they would use this expecting the person who they say is quote unquote  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="346" display="05:46" %}} - sleeping to stay dead um that is the euphemism that they would be using most commonly applied in the case of people  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="354" display="05:54" %}} - who wouldn't be resurrected and so you can kind of see how that that means that this question I mean it's a it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="359" display="05:59" %}} - reasonable question because people do wake up from sleep and people don't come back from death and so you can kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="365" display="06:05" %}} - see well maybe the word choice would be special because of that but actually just because of how this this euphemism  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="370" display="06:10" %}} - would be used culturally that kind of isn't the right way to think about it um and so all this to say this particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="379" display="06:19" %}} - case with Lazarus um it would be more normal for people to expect Lazarus not to come back and so when Jesus says this  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="387" display="06:27" %}} - everyone would know that he was using it as a euphemism because as we discussed previously by the time Jesus got to  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="394" display="06:34" %}} - Bethany where Mary and Martha and Lazarus lived uh Lazarus had already been in tuned for four days and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="402" display="06:42" %}} - everyone clearly knows that Lazarus is dead um and so that's why when Jesus says this they would know that he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="407" display="06:47" %}} - using this as a euphemism for death and it wouldn't have any significance like they wouldn't look at him and be like  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="414" display="06:54" %}} - well he said he's sleeping so that must mean that it's something different like oh what's Jesus going to do do now they  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="420" display="07:00" %}} - would understand this as a clear reference to Lazarus actually being dead now when it comes to the case of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="429" display="07:09" %}} - gyrus daughter it's basically the same thing that we talked about before so I argued in the previous video that even  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="437" display="07:17" %}} - though Jesus knew that she was actually dead he said what he did that is he took advantage of this association between  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="446" display="07:26" %}} - sleeping and death that was this common euphemism especially in their culture to kind of make things purposely ambiguous  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="452" display="07:32" %}} - to others so that neither he nor the girl and her family would receive as much negative attention from it and we  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="459" display="07:39" %}} - went into the reasons for that in the last video but the point is here that Jesus used the Sleep  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="467" display="07:47" %}} - terminology not because you know he was making the point that she was going to be awakened as opposed to most other  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="474" display="07:54" %}} - people but he was using it in association with the euphemism that we've gone over um specifically to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="481" display="08:01" %}} - it unclear in this particular case whether she actually was dead or not um playing off this idea that um there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="490" display="08:10" %}} - this association between these Concepts well people who weren't in the room with them when Jesus raised her from the dead  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="496" display="08:16" %}} - would hear this well you know people thought she was dead her family had called the professional mourners there  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="503" display="08:23" %}} - was there they were mocking him saying no she's actually dead silly why are you going in there and then Jesus does this  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="510" display="08:30" %}} - and says no she's just asleep purposefully to kind of Muddy the water so that it would kind of run this  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="517" display="08:37" %}} - interference uh between his ministry and these people who would be wowed by the celebrity of it and the same thing with  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="525" display="08:45" %}} - the girl and her family like we argued in that other video uh to kind of keep all of the attention and the pressure  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="531" display="08:51" %}} - and even the uh you know potential for the rulers of the Jewish people at the time to Target them specifically because  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="540" display="09:00" %}} - um as we learn in John 12 they were seeking to kill Lazarus because his testimony basically of well I was dead  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="549" display="09:09" %}} - and Jesus raised me was causing people to believe and so obviously these folks had uh a personal stake in making people  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="559" display="09:19" %}} - not believe um you know Jesus's uh uh the gospel was not it wasn't subversive politically but it turned people away  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="568" display="09:28" %}} - from the ruling powers that be basically they couldn't control people if people were believing the truth and so they  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="576" display="09:36" %}} - would seek to actually put Lazarus to death like we talked about in last video and so to spare this family that Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="583" display="09:43" %}} - would use this Association to make things less than clear right so people might say well uh you know people don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="590" display="09:50" %}} - rise from the dead there's no way he did that so she must actually only been sleeping and you know they just made a  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="595" display="09:55" %}} - mistake she wasn't actually dead she just looked dead people would kind of start that rumor because of this and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="603" display="10:03" %}} - as we've said that's kind of my take on why Jesus did this why he used that terminology in this case in Matthew  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="609" display="10:09" %}} - chapter 9 but the point is it's still not specifically because Jesus fornew that she would be raised um as in he  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="618" display="10:18" %}} - would have said this you know regardless it wasn't to foreshadow the fact that she'd be resuscitated so much as it was  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="625" display="10:25" %}} - to play into this whole purpose that we talked about previously all right so to finish off this video  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="634" display="10:34" %}} - we're just going to talk a little bit more about the associations between sleeping and death and how that's kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="640" display="10:40" %}} - of the relationship here not so much between sleeping and resuscitation so kind of what we just  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="647" display="10:47" %}} - talked about in these two cases was how in neither in John chapter 11 or Matthew chapter 9 was Jesus's use of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="655" display="10:55" %}} - terminology kind of directly tied to the resuscitation even though it ended up turning up in both of these cases where  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="662" display="11:02" %}} - resuscitation was present and so that kind of what that means is that I see the association of sleeping as being  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="670" display="11:10" %}} - primarily with death not with resuscitation so kind of the sleeping terminology showed up here because these  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="677" display="11:17" %}} - people were dead in the case of Lazarus or because Jesus was trying to make it purposely ambiguous for practical  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="684" display="11:24" %}} - reasons in the case of Gus's daughter not because these people were going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="690" display="11:30" %}} - resuscitated and so further evidence that this is kind of the case that is that the association goes that direction  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="697" display="11:37" %}} - is that there's actually places where sleeping is mentioned alongside death but not resuscitation so in First Kings  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="705" display="11:45" %}} - chapter 2 verse1 uh this reads then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="712" display="11:52" %}} - is a way of saying well David died and then was you know buried in the city of David um so this is a clear reference to  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="719" display="11:59" %}} - sleep being used for death as a euphemism but there is no Resurrection after this David was not one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="725" display="12:05" %}} - people in the Bible that was raised from the dead so this is an example of sleeping being mentioned alongside death  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="732" display="12:12" %}} - in a case that has absolutely nothing to do with resusitation and there's also kind of the reverse  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="738" display="12:18" %}} - case here there's also places where resuscitation is mentioned but no mention of sleeping at all and so an  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="745" display="12:25" %}} - example of this comes in Acts chap 20 when Paul raises a young man named udus from the dead after he falls out of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="753" display="12:33" %}} - window when Paul was teaching late at night um so this particular story I'm not really going to pull it up but you  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="759" display="12:39" %}} - can check the references here acts chap 20: 7-2 uh gives this account of Paul  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="765" display="12:45" %}} - raising this this young man from the dead and nowhere in that account is sleeping mentioned and so uh kind of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="773" display="12:53" %}} - thesis of the question here was well could the sleeping related language be related to this idea of resuscitation  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="781" display="13:01" %}} - well if that were the case you know maybe we'd expect it to show up here as well so kind of runs counter to that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="786" display="13:06" %}} - idea and so these observations are just kind of pointing out how the evidence here uh really does show that the Sleep  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="795" display="13:15" %}} - references are primarily associated with death not resuscitation and so that's kind of how we should think about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - topic that's where the evidence of scripture points  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="809" display="13:29" %}} - finally we're just going to go into a little bit more detail about this Association here that we just introduced  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="815" display="13:35" %}} - between sleeping and death so first off uh kind of speaking in terms of linguistic associations the verb for  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="824" display="13:44" %}} - raising someone from Death so someone who has died raising them from the dead is actually the same verb as Awakening  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="832" display="13:52" %}} - or rousing someone from sleep in both Hebrew and Greek so this verb here C in Hebrew and a in Greek um these are the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="843" display="14:03" %}} - verbs in question here and the relevant concordance entries uh for this particular type of usage that is uh when  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="851" display="14:11" %}} - the verbs are being used to raise people from the dead rather than waking them up from sleep um you'll see that it's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="856" display="14:16" %}} - same verb for both of these cases actually and so kind of why this is relevant is then you can see how closely  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="865" display="14:25" %}} - the concepts of sleep and death are related to each other in both Hebrew and Greek then and so that is sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="872" display="14:32" %}} - indirect evidence we can actually see s sort of some direct references to this that kind of pushed the metaphor or push  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="880" display="14:40" %}} - the euphemism even further here so we're going to look at some passages here from Jeremiah and job and just kind of show  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="886" display="14:46" %}} - how this association between sleeping and death is it's mentioned right there in the Bible you know very  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="892" display="14:52" %}} - unambiguously so here's one of those verses from Jeremiah Jeremiah 51:39 says this when they become heated up I will  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - serve them their banquet and make them drunk that they may become jubilant and may sleep a Perpetual sleep and not wake  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - up declares the Lord so this Perpetual sleep that they don't wake up from that is what death would be and then another  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="919" display="15:19" %}} - verse same chapter a few verses later Jeremiah chapter 51: 57 says I will make her princes and her wise men drunk her  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="928" display="15:28" %}} - Governors her prefects and her mighty men that they may sleep a Perpetual sleep and not wake up declares the king  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="935" display="15:35" %}} - whose name is the Lord of hosts and so again we see this reference to a Perpetual sleep that people won't wake  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="941" display="15:41" %}} - up from and this is how we clearly see that sleep is being used to refer to death and that there's this strong  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="948" display="15:48" %}} - association between the concepts finally this passage here from Job chapter 14 job  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="955" display="15:55" %}} - 14:12 says so man lies down and does not not rise until the heavens are no longer he will not awake nor be aroused out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="963" display="16:03" %}} - his sleep so again this idea that people who are dead are sleeping until the resurrection actually um you know shows  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="972" display="16:12" %}} - up elsewhere um but this concept again just showing that this idea of sleeping is used of people who are dead and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="981" display="16:21" %}} - sort of similar concept here we have some passages that talk about how people who are buried uh you know as was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="990" display="16:30" %}} - funerary custom of the ancient Hebrew people as in they buried their dead rather than cremating them for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="997" display="16:37" %}} - um well it describes people who are buried as actually sleeping in the ground so Daniel chapter 12: 2 says many  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1006" display="16:46" %}} - of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake these to everlasting life but the others to disgrace and  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1013" display="16:53" %}} - everlasting contempt so actually sort of a side note here this is a reference to the resurrection here in the Book of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1020" display="17:00" %}} - Daniel so not even new testament old testament here but you can see clearly that this verse is referencing those who  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1026" display="17:06" %}} - sleep in the dust of the ground I.E people who are dead and so again just strengthening that association between  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1033" display="17:13" %}} - the two concepts and so sort of where we're going with all this is that it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1038" display="17:18" %}} - just by accident that these verbs overlap in usage but because of an enduring semantic relationship between  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1045" display="17:25" %}} - the concepts of sleeping and death that's actually present in English as well and so to talk about this uh we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1052" display="17:32" %}} - going to be looking at AET here from a guy named John dun um so this one's pretty famous poem you may have heard of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - it before it's called Death be not proud so I'm gonna just going to go ahead and read through this briefly here and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1067" display="17:47" %}} - we'll talk about several of the lines that are kind of related to uh this conceptual Association that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1073" display="17:53" %}} - talking about so death be not proud by John dun death be not proud though some have  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1080" display="18:00" %}} - called thee Mighty and dreadful for thou art not so For Those whom thou thinkest thou Dost overthrow die not for death  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1089" display="18:09" %}} - nor yet C thou kill me from rest and sleep which by thy pictures be much pleasure then from thee much more must  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1097" display="18:17" %}} - flow and soonest our best men with thee do go rest of their bones and souls delivery Thou Art slave to fate chance  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1107" display="18:27" %}} - Kings and desper men and dos with poison war and sickness dwell and Poppy or charms can make us sleep as well and  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1116" display="18:36" %}} - better than thy stroke why swellest thou then one short sleep past we wake eternally and Death Shall be more no  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1124" display="18:44" %}} - more death thou shalt die okay so obviously poetic language here but some of these lines that we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1133" display="18:53" %}} - going to talk about uh this line here from rest and sleep which which by th pictures be so not so much a metaphor  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1141" display="19:01" %}} - there but clearly linking the concepts of rest and sleep with death and then uh you know rest of their bones in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1150" display="19:10" %}} - line uh that is definitely poetic language here but you know laying someone to rest we have that turn a  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1157" display="19:17" %}} - phrase just in kind of normal English parlance laying someone to rest I.E burying them well that is an association  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1164" display="19:24" %}} - there um but perhaps most clearly we have this Poppy or charms can make us sleep as well well this is actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1172" display="19:32" %}} - directly associating sleep with death right if we're saying that um as well here you know that is poppies and charms  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1180" display="19:40" %}} - can make us sleep just like how death can make us sleep that's the association here um and then of course final line  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1187" display="19:47" %}} - one short sleep past we wake eternally um to the resurrection like J like Daniel chapter 12 talked about actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1196" display="19:56" %}} - um but you can kind kind of clearly see that this is an English poem um and clearly has this association between  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1203" display="20:03" %}} - sleep and death here in English so not that we're going to build our theology um off of John dun sonnet but you can  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1210" display="20:10" %}} - kind of get the idea that the association is there even in English as well now just to close I would actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1218" display="20:18" %}} - probably think that this association between sleep and death is present in most human languages I haven't done a  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1224" display="20:24" %}} - formal study of it but it kind of just makes sense for us humans to to associate these two concepts because  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1230" display="20:30" %}} - they do have similar surface appearances so if someone is kind of looking at someone lying on a bed from a distance  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1238" display="20:38" %}} - can be kind of hard to tell if the person is living or dead or if they're just asleep um so I mean obviously  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1245" display="20:45" %}} - people's chest rising and falling from breathing that's one sign you know do they have breath because as we talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1250" display="20:50" %}} - about in our last video uh breath is actually synonymous with life um so people are alive when they have breath  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1257" display="20:57" %}} - that uh signifies the presence of the human spirit and when people die physically they no longer have breath  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1264" display="21:04" %}} - and that's because the word for spirit and breath are synonyms in both Greek and Hebrew it's the same word you use  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1270" display="21:10" %}} - the same word in Greek and Hebrew to denote uh uh breath and spirit the presence of the spirit so that's where  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1278" display="21:18" %}} - we're going to close this one um again not such a revolutionary Point here we've just gone through and shown that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - there is a clear association between sleep and death in both Greek in Hebrew gave some examples um how the verbs are  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1292" display="21:32" %}} - actually the verb to wake people up is actually the same as the verb to raise them from the dead and some of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1297" display="21:37" %}} - textual examples that just show that the concepts are clearly associated in how they think about them as well as in  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1303" display="21:43" %}} - English and presumably in most other languages but this is all why we say that the associations are between sleep  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1309" display="21:49" %}} - and death much more than they are between sleep and resuscitation which was kind of the main thrust of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1316" display="21:56" %}} - initial question here all right so just to briefly recap what we've gone over in this video we kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1325" display="22:05" %}} - raised the question upfront of could Jesus have been using this this language of sleep because he fornew that these  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1332" display="22:12" %}} - people would be resuscitated and sleep is less permanent than death um so that was kind of the question we started with  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1338" display="22:18" %}} - here we talked about lazarus's case how he'd already been dead for four days between Jesus got there so when he used  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1345" display="22:25" %}} - that word uh people would have obviously taken it they would have known that he was referring to death in Gus's  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1350" display="22:30" %}} - daughter's case which as we talked about previously in the other video um Jesus did this primarily to kind of leave  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1357" display="22:37" %}} - strategic ambiguity in that situation to kind of run interference both for himself and his own ministry as well as  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1365" display="22:45" %}} - uh this girl and her family um so those are Jesus's purposes in using the terminology like we argued in the last  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1372" display="22:52" %}} - video um but kind of more to answer the point of the question we said that sleeping is primarily associated with  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1379" display="22:59" %}} - death and not resuscitation so we talked about how the verbs in Greek and Hebrew for waking someone up are actually used  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1387" display="23:07" %}} - uh to signify raising someone from the dead the same verb is used for both things um and then we actually talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1392" display="23:12" %}} - about how that Association is present in English as well um so this is kind of closing off that question to say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1401" display="23:21" %}} - actually it's much more likely in fact it is the case that the Sleep references here that Jesus uses uh have much more  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1408" display="23:28" %}} - to do with death that is the relationship that's why he's using these words than they did with the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="_s0PMBAP-fs" time="1415" display="23:35" %}} - these particular people would be Resurrected
