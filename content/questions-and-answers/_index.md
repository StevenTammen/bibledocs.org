The Q&As on this site are dedicated to shorter treatments of various topics, organized in a question and answer format. Some of these Q&As come from correspondence with site readers, some are from my own correspondence with my teachers and mentors (I'm the one asking questions in these), and finally others (both questions and answers) are completely of my own creation.

The "answers" contained herein are not necessarily to be taken as holy and unquestionable writ (after all, they are coming from imperfect human beings), but simply as responses to the questions.
