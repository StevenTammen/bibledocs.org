### Q: But must I specifically obey my parents in matter X?

You didn't really answer my question. Do I have to obey my parents' wishes for me or not? Yes or No?

<!-- --- -->

### Third parties should not weigh in on specifics

It's not that simple. As discussed above, a third party has no possible hope of knowing the full picture, and for that reason, should refrain from weighing in on specifics.

Have you figured out what it is God is calling you to? Perhaps the simplest way to come to a Yes-or-No answer in matters like this is to figure out what you are called to. If you are reasonably certain about what God would have of you, then it's just a matter of comparing your parents' wishes against what you feel like you are supposed to do.

If the two don't align, then you are not out of line if you follow God's hand rather than obeying your parents' word, as long as you ensure that you maintain a respectful and deferential attitude toward your parents. (Even and perhaps especially if they are not worthy of it).

The tricky bit then is figuring out what God would have of you, but that's ultimately a topic for a different time. Humility and prayer are both critical elements in listening to the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit (compare 1 Kings 19:11-13).

But what about people who really do have rubbish parents --- what should they do if their parents make requests that seem completely nuts?

it is not your business, nor your parents. (Unless it is

self-centered, self-righteous, ignorant, and dictatorial? The sort that command their children to get good jobs so that they can live lives of luxury and not have to work themselves. These sorts of people do exist

This would seem to greatly disadvantage people whose parents are real pieces of work. I personally know people whose parents tied college money to doing the things commanded by them

If a person calls Child Protective Services on their own parents, is it possible that they are making stuff up? Sure. But

Whose opinion of your conduct do you think ultimately matters more? (Hint: it's the one of the eternal omnipotent creator who holds your judgment in His hands).

However, the question then becomes what exactly this "honoring" means. The Hebrew word translated as "honor" in the ten commandments (Exodus 20:12) is not especially noteworthy: honor is a good translation overall.

One can disagree with someone while still honoring them (otherwise the advisors of kings would have rather short lifespans). One can also honor from afar.

Note that even more than honoring, we are also commanded to *obey* our parents:

{verses}

Compare directive just below relating to slaves obeying their masters in all things, and parents certainly ought to be more loving towards us than slave masters.

The idea that we must submit to unreasonable whims of our parents is mostly false. We are ultimately accountable to God not them, and it should be pretty clear who we ought to be more afraid of displeasing.

So, for example, if you feel like God is leading you into ministry but your family wants you to become a doctor

If we are under the roof of our parents (such that we are financially dependent on them
