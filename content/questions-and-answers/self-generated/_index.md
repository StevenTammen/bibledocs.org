Q&As (both questions and answers) that are completely of my own creation.

While not always the case, it is nonetheless not uncommon for me to use past conversations I had with my mentor (Dr. Robert Luginbill of [Ichthys.com](https://ichthys.com/)) as a starting point in creating these. Much of the time I change around wording, reorder things, omit tangential details, and otherwise modify the substance of the exchanges to such an extent that they truly are something new entirely (albeit still closely related to the starting conversation). However, credit must be given where it is due, and wording in the responses of these Q&As occasionally does come word-for-word from Dr. Luginbill, if I thought he put something so well that I wanted to keep it without modifying it at all. And of course, his answers in the past exchanges largely were what led to me understanding many of the topics that I now write about here.
