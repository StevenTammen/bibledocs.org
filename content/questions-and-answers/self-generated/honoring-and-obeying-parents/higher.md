## Question

So, I know one of the ten commandments is to honor my parents, but they drive me crazy and want to pick out my life for me, even though I don't want what they want for me. What should I do? Do I need to submit myself to them and do as they say? Or can I "honor" them while still choosing my own path?

The Bible is very clear about the importance of giving our parents the respect they are due. It is never presented as "optional" or "just when we feel like it and it suits our purposes."

Under the Law, arrogant disobedience of one's parents was grounds for execution (Israel, as God's nation, being called out for exemplary conduct as bearers of an unattainably perfect standard):

{{% quote p="Leviticus 20:9" %}}
For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him.

{{% quote p="Deuteronomy 21:18-21" %}}
"If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives, and they shall say to the elders of his city, 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.' Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.

Clearly, then, these things are not to be trivialized or taken lightly. In fact, it more than just some vague notion of honor or respect that we are called to give our parents --- we are called to obey them:

{{% quote p="Ephesians 6:1-3" %}}
Children, ***obey your parents in the Lord***, for this is right. "Honor your father and mother" (this is the first commandment with a promise), "that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land."
{{% /quote %}}

{{% quote p="Colossians 3:20" %}}
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
{{% /quote %}}

This is the testimony of scripture.

### Obvious exceptions

If your parents tell you to do something that goes against our charter as Christians, then you have an obligation to obey God not them, of course. (Compare the circumstances under which we ought not submit to government authority: Daniel 6:10 as an example of the principles overriding Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2:13-17). The only opinion we ought to truly value is God's --- what does God think of our action?

Incidentally, those verses about government obedience above also give rise to a second exception: if our parents order us to do something illegal, then we should obviously not obey them.

### Abuse

Christians are called to provide for those in their house (1 Timothy 5:8). If parents are so deficient as to not only not adequately provide for their children, but instead become abusive towards them (whether physically, emotionally, etc.), the relationship has already been severed. Children in this situation owe their "parents" nothing at all --- and would be best served cutting ties and minimizing contact. Forgiveness is mandatory for us as Christians, but that doesn't mean continued contact or trust. To use a visual analogy, anybody who wrongs us terribly is free to approach us to ask forgiveness (and it is right and proper for us to give it to them), but they ought not be surprised to find the business end of a shotgun aimed squarely at their chest the entire time. Forgiving does not mean foolish.

(Incidentally, the above holds true not just for children, but also women who are victims of domestic abuse. The Bible may not mention spousal abuse as valid grounds for divorce as it does infidelity --- compare Matthew 19:9 --- but if women are allowed to sever contact with husbands not willing to honor the marriage bed, it is inconceivable that God's Will is that women suffer years of terrible abuse at the hands of men worse than unbelievers, as 1 Timothy 5:8 puts it).

#### God is the one who decides what abuse is

Questioning and being overly skeptical of victims of abuse is problematic for obvious reasons. But it is also true that some parties feel like shouting "abuse!" at the top of their lungs should be an escape-consequences-free card --- and this is improper.

In other words, teenagers do not get to selectively disobey rules their parents set by declaring them "abusive." Curfews, forbidding underage drinking and premarital sex, and even draconian punishments like grounding are not "abuse." Being beaten half-to-death and sexually assaulted by one's father is abuse. People should be scorned anytime they try to paint the former as in any way comparable to the latter.

Not everything is so cut-and-dry as this though. There certainly are parents out there who emotionally damage their children and undercut their self-confidence to such a degree that it is absolutely abuse --- even if it doesn't leave physical bruises.

Most of the time, it is not for us as third parties to try and parse the lines here. The parties involved know the realities at hand, as does God, of course. If someone is resisting their parents' legitimate authority, God won't let it stand. He also won't let actual parental abuse stand.

### Back to the main thrust of the question

So what of situations when our parents aren't really being abusive per se, but are also being a bit unreasonable (at least as it seems to us)? For example, what if our parents think it is their right to determine our career path, marriage partner, and even what we spend our independently-earned money on?

In general, such matters fall between the clear scriptural directives to obey our parents and clear-cut situations of abuse or improper/illegal commands on the part of our parents. This would put such things in the realm of application.

Note that scripture is strong enough in its exhortations to obey our parents that always obeying our parents should be our default mindset. There's no two ways about it.

#### Culture is important

There are collectivist cultures in the world wherein it is normal for the leader of a family/clan (typically an older male) to decide the affairs of everyone in the group (children being just part of the collective). This typically horrifies certain individuals from Western cultures ("what do you mean her father gets to pick who she marries?!"), but then again, most of these horrified individuals did not grow up in the society in question. By putting themselves in the shoes of the person they feel has been wronged and projecting their own culture, righteous condemnation comes all too easily.

Now, I'm not saying that it is not possible that some of these situations are not in fact problematic. The point is that unless it is really us in these circumstances, it is none of our business. (And here's the rub: how many children in these cultures feel greatly wronged by the situation?).

On the other hand, if, for example, my American parents suddenly decided that they ought to get to pick out who my wife will be without my say, this action, *here in America*, would be considered strange. As a matter of application, even if they positively commanded me to marry someone, it would not seem unreasonable for me to question things rather than meekly submitting to such a directive.



#### It is only our actual circumstances that matter

To generalize this a bit further: just because you can think up hypothetical outrageous situations does not mean *you* have grounds for ignoring *your* parents.

#### Things are different if you are still living at home

If you are living with your parents and still financially dependent upon them, the relationship is different than if you are out on your own and independent. It is right and proper for people to be able to run their households with authority --- and if you don't like it, well, God surely has a reason for you being there.

Once you are your own person more, your parents have less justified say in what it is you do. None of the Bible verses make this distinction in particular, but it is more or less common sense.

#### Our duty to God can help shed light on some of the possible areas of contention

Sometimes we really will have to weigh the input of our parents and decide whether or not it is something that we are called and obligated to follow. While it does always ultimately boil down to specifics only knowable by individuals and God, there are some common things that people clash with their parents on. In no particular order:

- Career (this is probably the biggest one)
- Choice of significant other
- Choice of friends
- Spiritual approach

Sometimes we can gain insight into the proper path of action by considering the spiritual dimension, and whether or not what our parents want for us really squares with what God wants for us.

##### Career

##### Choice of significant other

##### Choice of friends

##### Spiritual approach

But what about people who really do have rubbish parents --- what should they do if their parents make requests that seem completely nuts?

it is not your business, nor your parents. (Unless it is

self-centered, self-righteous, ignorant, and dictatorial? The sort that command their children to get good jobs so that they can live lives of luxury and not have to work themselves. These sorts of people do exist

This would seem to greatly disadvantage people whose parents are real pieces of work. I personally know people whose parents tied college money to doing the things commanded by them

If a person calls Child Protective Services on their own parents, is it possible that they are making stuff up? Sure. But

Whose opinion of your conduct do you think ultimately matters more? (Hint: it's the one of the eternal omnipotent creator who holds your judgment in His hands).

However, the question then becomes what exactly this "honoring" means. The Hebrew word translated as "honor" in the ten commandments (Exodus 20:12) is not especially noteworthy: honor is a good translation overall.

One can disagree with someone while still honoring them (otherwise the advisors of kings would have rather short lifespans). One can also honor from afar.

Note that even more than honoring, we are also commanded to *obey* our parents:

{verses}

Compare directive just below relating to slaves obeying their masters in all things, and parents certainly ought to be more loving towards us than slave masters.

The idea that we must submit to unreasonable whims of our parents is mostly false. We are ultimately accountable to God not them, and it should be pretty clear who we ought to be more afraid of displeasing.

So, for example, if you feel like God is leading you into ministry but your family wants you to become a doctor

If we are under the roof of our parents (such that we are financially dependent on them
