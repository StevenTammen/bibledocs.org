### Q: Is the resurrection causally linked to the forgiveness of sins? What about 1 Corinthians 15:17?

Recently, our Bible study group discussed what the resurrection accomplished on top of what was achieved by Jesus' crucifixion upon the cross and the judgement he bore therein. Here's how I understand things:

We Christians are separated from God by sin and death (which proceeds from sin: James 1:15). On the cross, Jesus bore the judgement for our sins in his body (1 Peter 2:24). The payment for our sins is metaphorically called "the blood of Christ." With Jesus taking God's judgement of our sins in our place, the cross solved once-for-all "the sin problem" that separates humanity from God.

However, Paul states in 1 Corinthians 15:17 that "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins." This would seem to imply that the efficacy of the cross is in some way intrinsically tied to the resurrection. If it were just a mention of overcoming death, then we might say that a clean split could be made vis-Ã -vis the cross solving the sin problem and the resurrection solving the death problem (inasmuch as they could be separated). However, the fact that this verse ties the forgiveness of our sins to the resurrection seems to throw a wrench into that.

So, at risk of asking a question that I should perhaps already know the answer to, what exactly does the resurrection "do"? We can say that the payment for our sins was made in the darkness of the cross (so-called ["penal substitutionary atonement"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_substitution)), right? Then what does the resurrection have to do with it? Or is the resurrection in fact primarily focused on the "death problem"? Then what of 1 Corinthians 15:17?

I poked around on [Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com/) a bit but didn't bump into anything that addresses this head-on (although it's entirely possible I missed something). Feel free to link me somewhere if I did.

One other thing:

Towards the end of our study, there was a discussion of the phrasing "Jesus was punished by the Father [for our sins]." It was said that phrasing things this way is problematic because of course Jesus did nothing wrong, and further, would not such punishment be incongruent with the perfect unity of the Trinity (i.e., the Father punishing the Son)? After talking in circles a bit, it seems that the people in question were willing to accept phrasing in the manner of "Jesus bore God's judgment of our sins (i.e., God's judgement is explicitly 'sin-directed')." The whole things seemed a bit pedantic as far as distinctions go, at least to me. I think some of this is perhaps because the specific mechanics of how exactly Christ bore our sins on the cross is not something we know. What do you think about all of this?

### Biblical hypotheticals need to always be viewed in light of the context they are brought up in

To take the last question first, indeed, this is a dispute over words. "Punishment" has connotations which are really not appropriate here, or are at the very least so misleading that it's just better to instead phrase things the way you phrased it.

On the former matter, whenever the Bible offers hypotheticals it is important to remember that it is only the hypothetical that is mentioned that should be considered and NOT all of the other variables that would/could/should be considered in the case of a parallel universe and parallel plan of God: there is only ONE plan of God, and it is perfect. This is an important application for the gospels as well. Paul's point is that the resurrection was necessary and that is a proof that it took place. We need not dive into the other details---and it would be misleading to do so. The plan included the resurrection as the stamp of approval of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ "who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification" (Romans 4:25 NKJV).

### Q: But what exactly is this hypothetical we are talking about?

I guess with regards to 1 Corinthians 15, what exactly is this hypothetical that Paul is constructing and then knocking down?

- verse  14: "And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith."
- verse  17: "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."

Is he saying that if Christ was not resurrected that that would mean that the Father did not accept the sacrifice of the cross (and this would be why "your faith is useless" and "you are still in your sins")?

I'm sorry if this all seems like debating angels dancing on the head of a pin, it is just that I was asked about atonement theories, consequently explained about the blood of Christ and what it means (i.e., the cross paying for all of our sins), and was then subsequently asked about what this 1 Corinthians verse means "if the debt for our sin was already paid on the cross?" (or something along these lines).

I think the point of struggle is that there might have been an implicit assumption in the conversation with respect to these verses from 1 Corinthians 15 that "after the cross but before the resurrection" (i.e., within that specific time period), the Father had already accepted the sacrifice of the cross. So then the confusion would stem from Paul stating that the resurrection was "necessary," as under this line of thought, it seems like God's redemptive purpose would have already been completed via the cross.

Does this make the origins of the confusion clearer?

### Paul is pointing out the absurdity Christianity without a resurrection; it is a rhetorical device

I suppose I would put it this way: if there is no resurrection of Jesus Christ, then there is no resurrection period (the operative point) and no God or plan of God---because then everything we've been told and believed is a pack of lies. In other words, if you take out this essential truth, there is no truth left of any kind. Since we know---and are so relieved---that such is not the case, what scripture says about the resurrection of Christ... and about the resurrection in general... and everything else... is absolutely true. So this is a rhetorical device to get the Corinthians to see the folly and the ramifications of their false position: it undermines absolutely everything.

### Q: But... how do we go from A to B in that way?

I get that the main rhetorical point of the passage is as you say (namely, "of course the resurrection exists and what we've been preaching to you is true"). But that's what makes the point of sin here seem like such a red herring to me:

{{% scripture p="1 Corinthians 15:16-19 | NIV11" %}}

**16** For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. **17** And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; ***you are still in your sins***. **18** Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. **19** If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.

{{% /scripture %}}

If the bolded bit said "for you also will not be raised," then I would have no questions---it seems like the passage would flow topically as:

- verse 16: resurrection
- verse 17: resurrection
- verse 18: resurrection
- verse 19: resurrection

But how it actually reads, we have

- verse 16: resurrection
- verse 17: no forgiveness of sins
- verse 18: resurrection
- verse 19: resurrection

That's what has me confused.

How can we show that Paul is making the point that if we throw out the resurrection, nothing else is certain either (including the incarnation and Jesus' payment on the cross, say)? Aside from this one oblique reference to the forgiveness of sins, everything else is 100% focused on resurrection, as it seems to me. In other words, the *reductio ad absurdum* argument of verse 18 and verse 19 is focused on resurrection.

Putting it as starkly as I can:

In verse 17, Paul says that if Christ has not been raised, we are still in our sins. Based on my understanding, at the point Jesus gave up his spirit (i.e., before he died, much less was resurrected), He had already fully paid for the sins of humanity in the darkness on the cross. How then can Paul propositionally tie the forgiveness of sins to the resurrection? The following two verses hinge on resurrection (verse 18 = lost because they are not resurrected; verse 19 = to be pitied since there is no resurrection).

I know this all "hypothetical" in the sense that Paul is making a *reductio ad absurdum* argument concerning the ridiculousness of not accepting the resurrection of Christ. But in so doing, he seems to explicitly tie the forgiveness of sins to the resurrection not the cross. But how does that "compute" logically?

Would the idea be that since Jesus repeatedly claimed that he would rise from the dead, if he didn't, it would be evidence that His other claims were also false (like being the Son of God sent to die for the sins of the world), and this is how we end up with "no resurrection = still in our sins" (since Christ would thus have been a liar and not capable of acting as a perfect substitute in our place)?

So, the resurrection doesn't change the mechanics of the sins being paid for on the cross *per se*. That is, **the actual forgiveness of our sins still depends on the cross, not the resurrection**. But without the resurrection to verify Jesus' word, we would be right in doubting that we are really saved, and that what he said was true = very real possibility that we are in no way forgiven.

Or, put even more simply, the resurrection was a sign verifying Jesus' words, and if it hadn't happened when He said it would, he would not be God, and we would not be saved. Thus, since Jesus spoke of His resurrection, it *became* necessary to validate His word (rather than being an inherent part of the process of expiating our sins).

Is this off in the weeds, or heading in the right direction?


### Spelling it all out

#### In short

If the resurrection didn't take place, then the Bible is worthless.

If I remove your spine, good luck walking to work tomorrow.

Remove any essential truth, especially one so vital as the resurrection, and everything falls to the ground; I am free now, using this clear logic, to destroy anything you personally hold near and dear (Paul goes after a few Corinthian favorites), in order to demonstrate to you that you can't have your cake (doctrines you like) and eat it too (throw out doctrines you don't agree with).

#### Additional explanation

As is often the case, some distance and hindsight make everything come into focus a bit better. That was the case for me here, now writing this several years later.

##### The wider context of 1 Corinthians 15

My focus during this exchange was entirely on making sense of this verse in light of the idea that the cross alone was sufficient in atoning for human sin. The thing is, atonement for sin is not Paul's point in this chapter. In fact, the resurrection of Christ isn't even the point of this chapter *per se*, but actually the concept of resurrection itself. The false notion Paul is arguing against in 1 Corinthians 15 is that there is no resurrection whatsoever, that this life is all there is.

Compare verse 12, which kicks off the progression of logic, and also verse 19. Both are very much dealing with the notion of resurrection from the dead *in general*. So it is that the bit about "If Christ was not raised from the dead... you are still in your sins" comes very much in the middle of this wider progression of points seeking to show how the concept of Christianity without resurrection (of anyone, Christ included) is utter rot.

Nothing I asked above ever strictly went against what context here demands of us interpretation-wise, but it is nonetheless just worth noting that that's what the context of this verse is.

##### Examining the logical structure of 1 Corinthians 15:12-19

Examining things formally, let's start with 1 Corinthians 15:12, and proceed from there.

Let's say we define the proposition \\(R\\) = "There exists a resurrection from the dead" and \\(C\\) = "Christ was resurrected from the dead".

Intuitively, we may state that \\(C \rightarrow R\\). In English: if Christ was resurrected from the dead, then that inherently implies that there exists a resurrection from the dead.

Verse 12 is essentially presupposing this implication, and saying that because of this implication, it is nonsensical to at the same time assert that \\(C\\) is true and \\(R\\) is false. Because if \\(C\\) is true, \\(R\\) *must* be true. That is the very definition of logical implication.

Verse 13 is then affirming that the [contrapositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition) of the implication is true: that is, that \\(\neg{R} \rightarrow \neg{C}\\). This is fine: for any implication, the contrapositive will always be true as well.

Verse 14 is a bit more complex. Let's define a couple more propositions. Let's say \\(P\\) = "Our preaching is useless" and \\(F\\) = "Our faith is useless." Then verse 14 is, in logic, \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow (P \land F)\\). Because implication is left distributive over conjunction ([proof](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Implication_is_Left_Distributive_over_Conjunction/Formulation_1)), we may also write this as \\((\neg{C} \rightarrow P) \land (\neg{C} \rightarrow F)\\).

Verse 15 starts by adding onto the logic of verse 14. If we let \\(W\\) = "We are found to be false witnesses", then the first part of verse 15 is \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow W\\). The latter half of verse 15 is again emphasizing the contrapositive of the opening implication, that is, \\(\neg{R} \rightarrow \neg{C}\\).

Verse 16 is actually the same thing (i.e., emphasizing that same contrapositive still). The order in English is switched around between the latter part of verse 15 (which is in the form "\\(\neg{C}\\) if \\(\neg{R}\\)") and verse 16, which is in the form "if \\(\neg{R}\\) then \\(\neg{C}\\)", but they are actually logically equivalent. The repetition here makes it clear that this is really the main point of this entire section.

In verse 17, Paul once again moves into the consequences of \\(\neg{C}\\). If we define yet another proposition \\(S\\) = "You are still in your sins", then verse 17 is saying \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow (F \land S)\\), which distributes to \\((\neg{C} \rightarrow F) \land (\neg{C} \rightarrow S)\\). You'll note that the structure of this verse is very similar to verse 14.

Verse 18 is also very similar to verse 15, in that it tacks on another thing to the list of consequences of \\(\neg{C}\\). If we define one final proposition as \\(L\\) = "Those who have died are lost", then verse 18 states \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow L\\).

Finally, verse 19 argues that if we assert \\(\neg{R}\\) (what "only having hope in this life" means), we Christians are to be most pitied, since we waste all our days upon a farce.

Before diving into atonement-related things, let's briefly recap. This entire passage is one long argument against the idea that there is no resurrection period. At a high level, Paul goes about demonstrating the falseness of such an idea by showing how the resurrection of Christ is intrinsically tied to the existence of a resurrection, and then how it is nonsensical for Christ to not have been resurrected, so therefore there must be a resurrection, QED.

He establishes the relationship between the resurrection of Christ and resurrection generally in verses 12 and 13. Then He makes a *reductio ad absurdum* argument in verse 14 and the first part of verse 15, showing how asserting \\(\neg{C}\\) is unworkable since it would also lead to \\(P\\), \\(F\\), and \\(W\\). In the latter part of verse 15 and in verse 16 Paul switches back to emphasizing the relationship between the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection generally, repeating the relationship to drive home its importance. Then, in verses 17 and 18, Paul uses exactly the same *reductio ad absurdum* approach he used in verse 14 and the first part of verse 15 to further show how asserting \\(\neg{C}\\) is unworkable. This time, the propositions he says would be absurd consequences of \\(\neg{C}\\) are \\(F\\) (note that this one is repeated), \\(S\\), and \\(L\\).

Paul spends time on all the consequences of \\(\neg{C}\\) in this passage for the sole purpose of showing how \\(C\\) must be true, and therefore, \\(R\\) too must be true. That is how Paul's argument "works" in this section.

##### The formal answer to my questions re: the relationship between the resurrection of Christ and the propitiation of human sin

My mentor kept his responses focused on the wider context of the passage---how Paul was using all his statements for the purpose of bringing the wayward resurrection-related beliefs of the Corinthians back in line. Fair enough.

I am always hungry for "the why" though, so did not actually let this one rest until I'd come up with a more thorough explanation for myself of how 1 Corinthians 15:17 is *not* somehow saying that Christ's resurrection is a necessary causal driver in the forgiveness of human sin (which would, logic mandates, make Jesus' payment for our sins upon the cross somehow insufficient on its own, which doesn't really seem right).

Most of my questions in the exchange centered around proposition \\(S\\) from above, but \\(F\\) and \\(L\\) honestly have the same effect in that, on the surface, they seem to imply that Christ's resurrection is a necessary causal mechanism in soteriology just as much as the cross itself is.

Let's get some things out of the way upfront:

Because the resurrection of Christ was foreordained in the Plan of God from eternity past, speaking of some hypothetical situation in which the resurrection of Christ did not occur is simply impossible in reality. There is ONE perfect Plan of God, and because God is Omnipontent and Omniscient, His Plan is guaranteed to be followed down to the slightest swerve of the smallest subatomic particle at the furthest edge of the universe. There is a zero percent probability that anything happens that is not in the Plan, or that anything in the Plan does not happen exactly as planned.

When we reason about the consequences of the resurrection of Christ not happening, then, it is entirely for the purpose of demonstrating how such a view cannot be possible, via *reductio ad absurdum*. That is all.

This doesn't remove the essential puzzle of how we might explain that 1 Corinthians 15:17 very clearly asserts that \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow S\\) though. Sure, we understand that Paul is using this contrafactual only for the sake of argument... but *why* would this even be true in the hypothetical? Since scripture is inspired, the logical statement must be true, but it doesn't seem to easily compute in a soteriological system that holds to penal substitutionary atonement.

Let me start off here by using an analogy with pirates, because why not. Let \\(C\\) = "A pirate has a severe deficiency in vitamin C", \\(S\\) = "A pirate has scurvy", and \\(O\\) = "A pirate has been out upon the ocean for a long period of time."

We know from science that the thing that causes scurvy is vitamin C deficiency; that is most definitely the causal mechanism. Yet the statement \\(O \rightarrow S\\) was also most certainly true back in the 17th century, say. So did sailing for long periods of time upon the ocean *cause* scurvy?

Hopefully, you can see where I am going with this. That implication can be completely true, *and yet not actually say anything at all about causality*. Here, the missing link is that \\(O \rightarrow C\\), and \\(C \rightarrow S\\). Being out upon the ocean only causes scurvy *indirectly*, because it was hard for pirates to get vitamin C in their diets when out upon the ocean for long periods of time. The causal mechanism was always still lack of vitamin C though.

Applying the same sort of logic to our theological question, it is possible to see how things fit together. That is to say, \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow S\\) (with our theological propositions, not the pirate propositions!) can be completely true without at the same time requiring \\(\neg{C}\\) to actually be the causal mechanism behind \\(S\\).

According to classical soteriology and penal substitutionary atonement, our sins are forgiven based upon the judgement for human sin Jesus bore upon the cross. So if Jesus not being resurrected somehow implies that He was not effectually judged upon the cross to pay for human sin, then that would explain how we end up with \\(\neg{C} \rightarrow S\\).

So, what ties Jesus not being resurrected to the cross not being effectual (and therefore, us still being left dead in our sins)? It's actually pretty simple. Here's an example of how you might get there:

1) Jesus directly said He would be resurrected after three days (see Luke 9:22).
2) If Jesus said this but was then not resurrected at all, he would have lied.
3) If Jesus lied, he could not be God (compare, for example, Titus 1:2).
4) Jesus needed to be both fully God and fully man to pay for our sin.
5) Therefore, if Jesus was not resurrected when He said He would be, He could not have actually paid for human sin since He could not have been God, QED.

(4) is perhaps the least obvious of the propositions in play here, but it is not at all "out there" as far as theology goes. That Christ was fully God yet fully man---and had to be in order to live a perfect life and die a perfect death in order to save us---is pretty basic stuff in theology. This would, in fact, be what the bread in communion metaphorically represents.

Here's a quote from [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) on the subject of Jesus *needing* to be both fully God and fully man:

{{% quote text="Ichthys" src="https://ichthys.com/4A-Christo.htm#:~:text=it%20was%20essential,its%20proper%20time." %}}

[I]t was essential for the Messiah, the Anointed One, to be both God and man to fulfill His mission because 1) only the God-man can be the sin-bearer who redeems mankind; 2) only the God-man can be the Father's regent to rule over redeemed mankind forever; and 3) only the God-man can mediate between the Father and sinful mankind as high-priest. Thus our Lord was Ruler, Redeemer, and Mediator by right of birth as the firstborn, won the right for us to share with Him in these offices by being our sin-bearer, and discharged (redeeming us at the cross), is discharging (mediating for us even now), and will discharge (ruling the world at His return) each of these offices in fulfillment of the Father's mission in His status as Messiah, with each accomplished in its proper time.

{{% /quote %}}

I chose to make a formal step-by-step argument there (re: God not being able to lie, and so on), but the gist of things if you'd prefer to be a bit more hand-wavy is exactly as my mentor emphasized all along: basically, if you throw out the resurrection of Christ, since it shows up absolutely everywhere in the New Testament, then you basically can't have confidence in any other teachings at all, including forgiveness of sins and salvation generally. That's why not believing it is so nonsensical, and why Paul made the argument he did to show that a resurrection for the dead must certainly exist.
