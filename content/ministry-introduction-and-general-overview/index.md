## Summary {#summary}

This video provides a summary of this ministry: who is behind it, what resources it offers, its community, and the meetings that the community has. This may not sound oh-so-complicated, but even so, there are a lot of things to go over, so the video is still not particularly short. Nonetheless, by the end of this video, you should have a good idea of what this ministry is setting out to do, and whether or not it might have things that you personally would find interesting and useful. If you have any questions or want more information, you can always reach out to me at steven@bibledocs.org.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=0">0:00</a> - hello friends my name is stephen tamman and today i'm going to be making the introductory video for this ministry<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=5">0:05</a> - bible docs going over four basic categories of information so first i'm going to go over some basic<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=12">0:12</a> - information about myself then i'm going to go over some of the resources that this ministry offers then we're going to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=17">0:17</a> - go over some of the options for community fellowship associated with this ministry and then lastly we're<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=23">0:23</a> - going to go over some of the meetings that our community has this good video could have been far<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=28">0:28</a> - longer but i'm going to try to keep it limited to just a narrow subset of core information i would encourage anyone who's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=34">0:34</a> - interested in taking a closer look at things to go through some of the links that we go through in part completely<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=40">0:40</a> - by going to the document documentation pages that are linked down in the slides in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=46">0:46</a> - the description of this video so i link the slides in the description and in those<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=52">0:52</a> - slides are links to each of the documentation pages that we go over in this video i have actually taken the time to write<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=59">0:59</a> - pretty thorough documentation for most things related to the ministry there's just not enough time for us to hit everything in one brief video here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=66">1:06</a> - this is the reason why we're only going to hit some of the most important things here and leave the rest for other people<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=71">1:11</a> - to read if people are interested that is i guess what i'm trying to say is that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=76">1:16</a> - there's a lot of really cool stuff offered a lot more than we'll have time to go over in the short presentation<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=82">1:22</a> - here so if you're interested go ahead and check out some of the links in the slides that are linked below<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=87">1:27</a> - so starting off we're going to go over some information about me so launching a bible study website has<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=94">1:34</a> - been an interest of mine for many many years and the time i'm making this video we're in late august 2022<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=101">1:41</a> - so i actually turned 26 pretty recently but i've actually been interested in this almost ever since i entered college<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=107">1:47</a> - which was oh gosh a long time ago now all the way back in 2014 to 2015.<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=113">1:53</a> - so as friends from georgia tech can probably attest i was already making noises about starting a website all the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=118">1:58</a> - way back in 2015 when i was still taking classes there well i sure won't go through the whole<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=124">2:04</a> - story because that would take a while but basically when i was studying engineering at georgia tech i started leading a bible study with several<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=130">2:10</a> - friends from one of the church small groups that we went to doing that i naturally started wanting<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=135">2:15</a> - to kind of make materials to help me do better leading that and a website seemed like a really obvious place to put those<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=141">2:21</a> - things now i actually did make a couple blogs over the years only to never quite feel<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=146">2:26</a> - that the timing was right until now that is now to better prepare for me being able<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=152">2:32</a> - to lead studies like this i actually transfer to the university of georgia in summer 2016 to study greek hebrew and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=158">2:38</a> - some of the ancient history and culture relevant for interpreting the bible i focus specifically on the histories<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=165">2:45</a> - and cultures of ancient greece and rome as those are the places where the gospel message initially spread<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=171">2:51</a> - so basically i wanted to make sure that i was qualified and i knew what i was talking about so that i could lead these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=176">2:56</a> - bible studies as i felt like i was being called to so the end of all this i ended up at the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=182">3:02</a> - university of georgia as a double major majoring in both greek and classics i also took several classes in hebrew when<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=189">3:09</a> - i was studying now some things led to another and eventually i added a third major in computer science and i had this as the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=196">3:16</a> - goal of supporting myself as a software engineer after i graduated so after i added the major in computer<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=202">3:22</a> - science i actually had three majors i was a triple major and so for a couple years there i was super super busy you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=207">3:27</a> - know taking classes in both greek and hebrew and then programming classes like operating systems and algorithms and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=212">3:32</a> - databases and all that and so i would say for i think was about two years where i overlapped in all three majors i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=218">3:38</a> - was just taking really heavy semesters very busy in college and i was leading a bible study as well so college was super<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=224">3:44</a> - busy for me but i'm glad i did it because i got a lot of good exposure to greek and hebrew and some of the history<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=230">3:50</a> - and culture that's important for being able to interpret the bible correctly<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=235">3:55</a> - well nowadays i actually do support myself by being a software engineer i work for the air force in a civilian<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=242">4:02</a> - role as a full stack web developer basically i help build business web apps that help support the air force's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=249">4:09</a> - complicated network of finances and logistics at present i'm actually the lead developer for i guess let's see we got a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=256">4:16</a> - new guy so i guess a six person agile software development team that's basically just a snooty sounding<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=261">4:21</a> - way of saying that i work with our project manager a little bit more closely on things like sequencing and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=266">4:26</a> - schedule and i also do a bit more high level technical design in some of the other devs which i really enjoy<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=272">4:32</a> - anyway i could go on but i think that's basically all that there is to say about me condensed into a short version<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=279">4:39</a> - so if anyone's interested in reading in a bit more depth there is a page up on the site specifically going over who i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=286">4:46</a> - am and kind of how i got on the path that i'm currently on so in the slides presentation it's this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=291">4:51</a> - slide right here we're going to go ahead and click on this link so this is what the page looks like when<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=297">4:57</a> - it's pulled up and if i scroll around a little bit you can see that this page is very very long<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=302">5:02</a> - oh well i do think it hits the main points of my life story without missing too much so if you're interested in some<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=308">5:08</a> - more of the final finer details about my path this would be the page on the website to look at<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=313">5:13</a> - so that's enough about me next we'll be looking at some of the resources that this ministry offers<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=318">5:18</a> - starting off if you were to ask the question does this video offer text audio or video i would actually simply<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=324">5:24</a> - answer yes it's a big goal of mine to offer content across all three of these mediums since<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=330">5:30</a> - there's a lot of advantages in doing such so this next slide here links to the section in the site's documentation<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=336">5:36</a> - talking about these things i'm going to go ahead and click on this top link on the slide which will take us to this section<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=343">5:43</a> - and here we are on the document documentation page on the website looking specifically at this section<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=348">5:48</a> - here this wider page is the content organization page which is one of the about the site pages<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=354">5:54</a> - on the website there's also the content features page which we'll look at a bit later these two are the biggest<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=359">5:59</a> - documentation pages that go over things about the site itself now within this section there's this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=364">6:04</a> - header down here regarding this header and the section that follows it i usually start out<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=370">6:10</a> - writing text studies because that's how i find it easiest to draft new content and then over time i'll build slides for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=377">6:17</a> - the content record videos and rip the audio off the video so that everything ends up split across text video and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=382">6:22</a> - audio all three and then another thing to talk about here this note section right here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=388">6:28</a> - after i make the videos in terms of text options it's not just the web page text but also the same content split out into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=395">6:35</a> - slides these slides can be used to easily teach through the material which is actually something that i would<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=400">6:40</a> - encourage for anyone who's interested that is far from discouraging people from using the resources on the site in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=406">6:46</a> - their own bible teaching endeavors i actually really encourage it as long as it's not passed off as your own or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=411">6:51</a> - charged for i've got no problems with it here in the body of christ we're all on the same team right so why not use<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=417">6:57</a> - resources if it makes everyone else's lives easier in any case whether it is either one of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=423">7:03</a> - the text options or the audio or the video people can use whatever is best in their particular circumstances ever<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=429">7:09</a> - since i started thinking about the different mediums complementing each other i've gotten really excited about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=434">7:14</a> - this idea so down further on in this section this is all of these things are things that i've<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=440">7:20</a> - done to try to enhance the content to make this idea of supporting all three mediums<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=446">7:26</a> - as useful as possible so i would say all of these things together are the main selling point of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=453">7:33</a> - why doing things that cross mediums is so valuable for the content of a website<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=459">7:39</a> - now to kind of give an example of this in practice we're going to go ahead and look at one of the content pages on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=464">7:44</a> - site so back on the slide here the second link on the slide is a link to an<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=469">7:49</a> - example study content page on the site so we're going to go ahead and click that so starting out you can see the title of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=475">7:55</a> - the study and then also the embedded video right under it you can play the videos right off of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=481">8:01</a> - site's web pages or actually go to the youtube channel to watch them either approach works fine right under the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=487">8:07</a> - video you can see that there's this bar that has some links in it the first link is to the studies<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=492">8:12</a> - playlist on youtube and that can be helpful if you want to go from any given study lesson go find the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=498">8:18</a> - playlist that has all of the lessons in that same study and then the next two links are to download the video and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=503">8:23</a> - download the audio now these are stored on archive.org which is where i host the video and the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=509">8:29</a> - audio for people to download actually downloading the video and audio is useful since then you don't need an<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=515">8:35</a> - internet connection to watch or listen it's especially good for people reliant on mobile data or without great internet<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=521">8:41</a> - infrastructure such as some folks in the developing world now this last link in the link bar under<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=527">8:47</a> - the video is a link to the slides presentation gone over in the video the text on the slides in this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=532">8:52</a> - presentation actually directly matches that further down on the page but the content here is just split into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=537">8:57</a> - bite-size slides to make presenting much easier so after the video and all these links comes the summary section<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=544">9:04</a> - every lesson has a summary that gives just the basic information about what is being gone over in a short paragraph or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=550">9:10</a> - two these summaries make it a lot easier to skim through things on the site to find what you are looking for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=556">9:16</a> - next comes the list of topics gone over in the timestamp list now these timestamps are immediately<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=562">9:22</a> - followed by the main content section which contains the full text of the study here on the web page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=568">9:28</a> - you'll note that the topics here in the timestamp list actually match the main content headers on the page and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=573">9:33</a> - therefore the links in the table of contents that show up in the right sidebar so if i toggle the table of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=579">9:39</a> - contents here you'll see that these topics here actually directly match the topics as they show up in the timestamps<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=585">9:45</a> - here so for example the title of the introduction here that shows up here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=591">9:51</a> - the actual introduction adam and even us that's this content header and so you can see that they map one to one on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=597">9:57</a> - links in the table of contents so you can navigate through the text content of the study on the site with the sidebar<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=603">10:03</a> - table of contents or use the timestamps to navigate to the time in the youtube video when those same topics first come<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=608">10:08</a> - up in the video presentation cool huh the timestamps here for the video and audio are actually a really big deal<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=615">10:15</a> - since they make it much easier to navigate within these mediums which can't be skimmed nearly as quickly as text audio timestamps for topic<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=622">10:22</a> - transitions are actually pretty common in information dense podcasts for example and this is really no different<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=627">10:27</a> - here on this site now last thing offered here if we go down through the entire content section<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=633">10:33</a> - down at the bottom of the page you'll see that there's a section that has a full transcript of the video and the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=638">10:38</a> - audio so these recorded mediums here we have a full transcript for the audio and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=643">10:43</a> - these links here to the timestamps these are hyperlinked directly back into the youtube video so the video form of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=649">10:49</a> - content now this transcript here is pretty similar to the transcripts that youtube offers and in fact they're built<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=655">10:55</a> - from youtube's automatically generated transcripts but since these transcripts are located on the study web pages<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=660">11:00</a> - themselves they can be searched through or skimmed right alongside the main text of the study and the summaries and this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=667">11:07</a> - is really advantageous we'll talk about searching and skimming again in a bit when we go over aggregation pages<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=673">11:13</a> - well there you have it once i've gotten around to making the video for some of the content that i've<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=678">11:18</a> - written all of these things will be added on the website and then you'll be able to access any of them on the lesson<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=684">11:24</a> - page like i said before supporting all three content mediums is a pretty big priority<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=689">11:29</a> - for me since i think there's so many advantages to it basically it just makes the content so much richer than it otherwise would be<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=696">11:36</a> - so my long-term goal is to have this for absolutely all content on the website i've actually done my very best to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=703">11:43</a> - automate a lot of the things in this process such as the video editing so that i'll be able to scale it up and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=708">11:48</a> - sustain it long term right well we just went over a lot of enhancements to the content on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=713">11:53</a> - website related to all these content mediums but it turns out that a lot of the useful stuff carries right onto the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=719">11:59</a> - videos on the youtube channel as well so let's briefly go there and have a look at the videos that show up on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=725">12:05</a> - youtube channel now the channel is linked on this slide here so we'll just go ahead and click on this link to get to the youtube channel<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=731">12:11</a> - okay so here's the main link to the youtube channel you can see we've got our banner image and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=737">12:17</a> - the profile picture here but up top here we have the uploaded videos and here are just the uh linked playlist that i've<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=743">12:23</a> - made so far on the channel these are all the normal things that show up on youtube channels<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=749">12:29</a> - so we'll go ahead and click on one of the playlists here to get taken to the playlist page and now let's just go ahead and jump to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=756">12:36</a> - the second video here you know this is a content video in this playlist so we can go ahead and get an idea of what the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=762">12:42</a> - individual videos look like okay so if we have a look at this video a lot of stuff should look familiar<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=768">12:48</a> - the video has a descriptive title just like the web page for example but down here in the description you can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=774">12:54</a> - see that it has a lot of the other things too for example it has the link to the water playlist the link to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=779">12:59</a> - download the video the link to download the audio the link to view the slides also has the summary like you can see<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=784">13:04</a> - here and even the time stamps just as we had on the website page so basically it has all the same useful<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=790">13:10</a> - content functionality as the website pages themselves now youtube actually automatically<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=796">13:16</a> - splits the video up into sections based on the timestamps which is pretty neat you can see what section you are in down<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=801">13:21</a> - at the bottom of the video so it looks something like this you see here this is the current topic that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=807">13:27</a> - we're part of actually if you look closely you can see the topic breaks in the video too so if<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=812">13:32</a> - you hover over in the video timeline you can see where you switch topics because then the topic label changes<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=818">13:38</a> - and actually if you go over here to the three dots you can show the transcript for the video as well so we'll go ahead<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=823">13:43</a> - and do that so now i've scrolled up a bit and this is what the page looks like with the transcript pulled up and so if you click<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=829">13:49</a> - any one of these lines it'll take you to that specific time in the video and so this works just like the transcripts on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=835">13:55</a> - the website that have the hyperlinks because the hyperlinks on the website will take you to the time in the video too so you can see the time changes over<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=841">14:01</a> - here as i click the line in the transcript but these just show up right next to the youtube video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=847">14:07</a> - now if you want to you can actually also turn on subtitles or closed captions and you do that through the settings menu<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=853">14:13</a> - here so settings menu subtitles and uh if you select the english here it will<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=858">14:18</a> - actually basically go in the transcript wherever you are a statement by statement in the video and it's the same<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=865">14:25</a> - text as as is in the transcript but it's just showing it as subtitles instead so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=870">14:30</a> - that's pretty cool you can turn that on and off and while we're down here looking at settings another thing that's just a quick note you can change the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=876">14:36</a> - playback speed of videos and so this is something cool that youtube lets you do now i will say that me personally i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=882">14:42</a> - almost always listen to videos on at least 1.5 speed because it's actually possible for us humans to listen to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=889">14:49</a> - audio a little bit faster than most people normally speak and so if it's stuff that i'm reasonably familiar with<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=895">14:55</a> - like many of my own videos i often listen it two times speed or more so this is just a note<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=902">15:02</a> - increasing the playback speed here saves a lot of time and like i said i think for most video content doing 1.5 times<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=909">15:09</a> - speed is a good baseline as it just helps you be able to get through videos a little bit faster without losing much<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=915">15:15</a> - ability to understand what is being said so anyway the main point is that all the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=920">15:20</a> - useful functionality is basically present on the youtube videos too so if you want you can basically just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=925">15:25</a> - subscribe to the youtube channel and view everything there and that will work fine too especially if you're more interested in the video side of things<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=932">15:32</a> - well do you feel overloaded with information yet we've actually still got a fair bit left to go so we'll keep going here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=938">15:38</a> - next we're going to talk about the page types that make up the main content of studies i say main content because there are<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=944">15:44</a> - also discussion discussion pages and videos associated with study lessons we're going to mostly ignore those in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=951">15:51</a> - this general intro video due to time constraints but i guess i'll say a word or two about them<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=956">15:56</a> - basically discussion videos come from the questions and conversations that come out of the bible study meetings<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=961">16:01</a> - when we have them those are the community meetings we have where i teach through some bit of the content that's up on the website<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=968">16:08</a> - so the discussion content is closely associated with the main content but it's actually kind of like a snapshot of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=974">16:14</a> - the organic reaction that our community has to the main content on the site<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=979">16:19</a> - i don't know if that makes any sense but that it really is what it is it's kind of like capturing a snapshot of what people<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=985">16:25</a> - think about the study content as we go through it as a group anyway the main page types associated<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=991">16:31</a> - with the main content that's what we're going to focus on right now just because that's the primary<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=997">16:37</a> - focus of the actual study text on the website so the link on this slide here also<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1002">16:42</a> - points to a section on the content organization page on the site that goes over all the page types i'm actually not<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1008">16:48</a> - going to go through this right now since i think showing will be easier than telling but you can certainly read this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1013">16:53</a> - full link if you want more information about the page types that we're talking about here so i'm actually going to go<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1018">16:58</a> - back to that page from before the content page that we linked on the last slide i guess there was a couple slides back<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1025">17:05</a> - here but this link here the example study content page so we're going to go back to this page here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1030">17:10</a> - so this web page should look familiar as we just used it as an example of how this ministry supports all three content<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1036">17:16</a> - mediums we're now going to go look at how we might get to this page on the website<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1041">17:21</a> - so first we're going to go look at one of the top level content types called longer topical studies these are<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1047">17:27</a> - basically longer studies on the site that trace a specific subject rather than going verse by verse<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1052">17:32</a> - so over in the sidebar here you see how there's a subsection in the sidebar titled content we're going to go ahead<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1058">17:38</a> - and click on the menu here for longer topical so that's the longer topical study so we're going to go ahead and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1063">17:43</a> - click this link and after clicking this link you can see that we are brought to a list page that lists out the available studies within<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1070">17:50</a> - this content type right now i have summaries shown so the list will have both study titles and study summaries<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1076">17:56</a> - you can actually show and hide summaries over here and in fact there is a setting on the settings page of the website<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1082">18:02</a> - that's down here that lets you globally turn off or turn on summaries so you would hide them mostly just because it<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1089">18:09</a> - lets you show more stuff on the page at any given time but the summaries are useful because they help give you a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1094">18:14</a> - sense of what the studies are about so once you've picked a specific study on the list page that you want to look<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1099">18:19</a> - at you can just go ahead and click on it and that will bring you up to the aggregation page for the study<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1105">18:25</a> - so i call these things aggregation pages because they let you search or skim through all the content in the study<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1110">18:30</a> - aggregated in one place even if there's a lot of it so you can show all the content in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1116">18:36</a> - study if you want to and the same thing with transcripts because each each study individually has content and transcripts<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1122">18:42</a> - you see these sections here and if you show everything you'll be able to search your skin through absolutely everything across all the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1128">18:48</a> - lessons in the study so if you want to show all content or transcript sections across the page you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1133">18:53</a> - can see we have two lessons in this study at the moment you can actually go in the sidebar menu here and there are<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1140">19:00</a> - options in the sidebar menu to show and hide things so we're gonna go ahead and show all content so that expanded this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1145">19:05</a> - content section also expanded the content section down here so it showed all the content sections on the page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1150">19:10</a> - then if you do the same thing for transcripts you'll see that it loaded the transcripts as well now the transcripts are usually quite long so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1156">19:16</a> - unless you actually want the transcript kind of makes sense to keep them hidden and to do the reverse you just hide transcripts hide content and then that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1163">19:23</a> - collapses things back down now if you have everything collapsed this gets you a much smaller set of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1169">19:29</a> - things to search your skin through the titles summaries and time stamps tend to be the best things for getting a general<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1174">19:34</a> - overview of what any given individual lesson is about because they are the most information dense things for each<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1179">19:39</a> - lesson if you have everything minimized but then decide that you want to see the content and transcript for a given<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1185">19:45</a> - lesson that catches your eye you can just expand them out for that lesson specifically one at a time and you do<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1190">19:50</a> - that just by you know finding one of these here the buttons on the page that says click to show and when you click it<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1197">19:57</a> - you know you can show it or hide it individually one by one just like this so you can click out the content here go<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1202">20:02</a> - through the content and if you want to see the transcript you can just expand that as well and so this is going one by one as opposed to these things in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1209">20:09</a> - sidebar that lets you do it for the whole page at the same time so as to these aggregation pages<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1214">20:14</a> - generally i recommend using these aggregation pages just for searching and skimming doing those operations on all<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1221">20:21</a> - of the text in the study and instead doing all the main reading on the content pages themselves so you can get<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1226">20:26</a> - to the content pages themselves just by clicking on the lesson headers on the aggregation page so to get to this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1232">20:32</a> - lesson we just click on the header for the lesson on the aggregation page and that takes us directly to the content<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1238">20:38</a> - page here and here we are back on the page we started on so that's how you get to this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1243">20:43</a> - content page and i'll just go over that again real quick you go to the list page for the content type you go to the aggregation page for this study and then<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1250">20:50</a> - having found the lesson that you want to look at you click on the header on the aggregation page to get taken to the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1255">20:55</a> - content page for the lesson and that's how we got back here so these pages here the content pages<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1261">21:01</a> - are kind of like the leaf pages in the content tree have on them all the things that we talked about before the video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1267">21:07</a> - the summary the time stamps the transcript and so on and you'll notice that unlike the aggregation page things aren't ever<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1274">21:14</a> - minimized like they like they can be sometimes on the aggregation page so the content and the transcript on this page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1280">21:20</a> - you know that you don't have the minimize they are always here on the full page and one of the reasons why it's easier to just generally read on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1287">21:27</a> - the individual content pages is because they only have in their table of contents<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1292">21:32</a> - the links for just one lesson as opposed to all of the lessons combined so it makes it kind of easier to navigate<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1298">21:38</a> - the hierarchy of content headers and things like that because you're only looking at a smaller subset of the content at any given point in time<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1305">21:45</a> - it also makes it pretty easy to kind of go day by day if you want to just read for example a specific lesson every day<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1311">21:51</a> - it's very easy to chunk content just by going one content page at a time now you can get from one of these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1316">21:56</a> - content pages in a particular study to the next or previous content page in the same study using the navigation sections<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1322">22:02</a> - at the top or bottom of the page so here's what the section navigation looks like at the top of the page and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1328">22:08</a> - then if we scroll down all the way to the bottom under the transcript so the very bottom of the page you'll see that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1333">22:13</a> - we also have the same section navigation here which will take you from one page in the section to the next so here we're<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1339">22:19</a> - going back between the pages here in this study now if you'd rather go back to the aggregation pages from one of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1345">22:25</a> - content pages in the study you can just click here on this middle index link and this will take you back to the aggregation page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1351">22:31</a> - now if you notice over here in the sidebar the sidebar menu actually has like previous and next links as well as<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1359">22:39</a> - the link back to the study index as well so these things that are in the content or sorry in the section<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1364">22:44</a> - navigation at the top of the page in the bottom of the page you can also always access those things from the sidebar menu<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1371">22:51</a> - and that's convenient because then no matter what your scroll position on the pages you can always navigate whenever you want to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1377">22:57</a> - well i think that about does it for the page types related to main content in the studies<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1382">23:02</a> - just as a brief recap list pages list out all the content for a specific content type<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1388">23:08</a> - an aggregation page for a study puts all the content in the study on the same page for searching and skimming<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1395">23:15</a> - and finally content pages in a study make it easy to read one section of content at a time so that things don't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1400">23:20</a> - get so overwhelming so at this point we're almost done going over all the resources that this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1406">23:26</a> - ministry offers to finish off this discussion i'm going to quickly go through several other things relating to the content that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1413">23:33</a> - is offered on the website and after we finish this final discussion here we'll go ahead and move<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1419">23:39</a> - on to talking about the community associated with bible docs and also the meetings that our community has<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1426">23:46</a> - okay back to this slide in the presentation here you can see that we have several links on this slide these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1432">23:52</a> - are the remaining content related things we're going to be talking about so we'll start off by talking about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1437">23:57</a> - table of content stuff so i'll click on this first link here on the slide this section here is on the content<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1443">24:03</a> - features page the second of the main pages documenting things about the site itself in particular here we're talking<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1449">24:09</a> - about the table of content structure that this site makes use of so i started out with the scroll spy<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1455">24:15</a> - bootstrap plugin but i actually coded some of the behavior here myself so if i open up the table of contents you'll see<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1462">24:22</a> - that depending where you scroll on the page the table of contents dynamically updates so that it shows you where you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1467">24:27</a> - are so you can see that it actually bolds all of the relevant headers in the hierarchy so if i keep scrolling you'll<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1473">24:33</a> - see here's the parent header and here's the child section that you're in it bolds all the relevant headers in the hierarchy as well as having these gold<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1481">24:41</a> - bars over here to the left and the gold bars kind of correspond to the nesting within sections so now that i'm in this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1487">24:47</a> - deeply nested section this is a parent this is a parent this is a parent and here's the section we're on you can kind of see how you're nested by following<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1494">24:54</a> - the gold bars on the table of contents so these are just some of the cool things that i've added to the user<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1500">25:00</a> - interface of the table of contents on this site so the best part of this is you can always see where you are on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1506">25:06</a> - page just by glancing at the table of contents over here so if you click on one of the topics in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1511">25:11</a> - the table of contents you'll be taken immediately to that section on the page so just click on old testament go take<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1517">25:17</a> - it to old testament let's say we want to go read about some of the dynamic footnotes that this site offers click on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1522">25:22</a> - that and then you get immediately taken to the section then up in the address bar here if you copy this link you can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1528">25:28</a> - actually save it or share it with others and this will take you directly back to this section on the web page and that's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1533">25:33</a> - really useful as it lets you kind of specifically link down to sections on the page rather than just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1539">25:39</a> - the page itself so useful for saving things for yourself for also sharing links with others okay so back to the slide here the next<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1546">25:46</a> - thing we're going to look at are what i call special content sections so clicking to open up this link here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1552">25:52</a> - this section here is on the content organization page again so i'm actually not going to spend too much time here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1558">25:58</a> - but if i scroll down you can see that there's actually quite a few different content sections that this site offers<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1563">26:03</a> - and makes use of now i have a bunch of notes explaining what all of these do and how i use them but that's what this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1568">26:08</a> - documentation section is here so even though there are a lot of them they all basically work the same way<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1574">26:14</a> - they all split content out separately by using a different background color all sections of the same background color<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1580">26:20</a> - or sorry all sections of the same type have the same background color so for example if i scroll up here to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1586">26:26</a> - side notes somewhat tangential discussion ends up in these yellow side note sections<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1591">26:31</a> - as another example discussion of greek and hebrew and other technical matters ends up in these orange technical<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1597">26:37</a> - discussion sections finally if i keep scrolling down to application any discussion of applications<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1603">26:43</a> - specifically rather than bible teaching that is not situation or circumstance dependent ends up in these green<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1609">26:49</a> - sections here that's really all there is to it there's a few other types all of which are explained on this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1616">26:56</a> - documentation page but that's the general idea using different background colors to make different kinds of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1621">27:01</a> - content easy to identify so that you can specifically pick these things out on the pages or skip them if it's relevant<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1628">27:08</a> - you know such as for example some people maybe not wanting to read discussion of greek and hebrew and stuff so they can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1633">27:13</a> - just skip these sections whenever they see an orange one that's the basic idea all right so continuing on back to the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1640">27:20</a> - slide we're going to next go over embedded bible app windows that this site makes use of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1645">27:25</a> - so the section here that we're now in this is another section on the content features page now these things are pretty cool there's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1651">27:31</a> - an online bible study application called the step bible app and the folks that developed this web app have an api that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1657">27:37</a> - makes it easy to embed windows directly onto other web pages like the web pages of this site in these embedded bible app<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1664">27:44</a> - windows you can do a lot of useful things i'll only go through a couple things here but there's actually a lot more you can do too<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1670">27:50</a> - i added some interface to the embedded windows to make them easy to resize because sometimes maybe it's more convenient to have them bigger or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1676">27:56</a> - smaller so they take up more room or less room you'll usually want a taller height on the windows if you're doing<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1681">28:01</a> - some of the more complicated stuff like some of the stuff that we're going to go through here let's go ahead and let's make the height<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1687">28:07</a> - of this window here on the page 800 pixels tall and so by clicking that button we made<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1693">28:13</a> - the height of this window on the page much taller and so that will give us more room to work with here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1699">28:19</a> - now if you click on an english word in an english version like this you'll get taken to the lexicon entry for the greek<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1704">28:24</a> - or hebrew word behind the english word so let's click on this word here the word for beginning and so because<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1710">28:30</a> - we're in the gospel of john here this is greek because the gospel of john was written in greek and so this takes us to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1716">28:36</a> - the greek word for archae which is beginning in greek and so just by clicking on the word like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1722">28:42</a> - you saw here so we just go ahead and we just click on the word just by clicking on the word you can see that scripture in these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1728">28:48</a> - embedded bible app windows is directly tied into lexicons you don't even have to fiddle around with strong's numbers<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1733">28:53</a> - to look anything up since all you have to do is click on a word directly and it takes you right to the lexicon entry for the greek or hebrew behind the english<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1740">29:00</a> - so that's the cross-linked lexicon functionality that these embedded by block windows support<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1746">29:06</a> - so that's one sort of feature that we're going over here now another interesting thing is from this lexicon interface you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1753">29:13</a> - can also click on this link here to access an exhaustive original language concordance to see everywhere that that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1759">29:19</a> - particular greek or hebrew word is used across the entire bible so if we go ahead and we click this link<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1765">29:25</a> - here this is what we see so we'll go ahead and minimize that because it pulled it up here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1770">29:30</a> - so you'll see that we get a list of every single usage of the greek word rk here in the new testament in the greek<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1776">29:36</a> - right so beginning beginning beginning all the way starting at the gospel of matthew and going through here all the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1782">29:42</a> - way down to the end of the new testament in the book of revelation it shows us all of the usages across the entire new<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1788">29:48</a> - testament this can be really really useful in finding parallel or related passages for example and having the concordance<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1794">29:54</a> - operate on greek or hebrew directly rather than english is a lot better because that way you won't ever get tripped up by translators translating<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1801">30:01</a> - different greek or hebrew words with the same english word so just for example you might consider the english word love there are multiple<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1808">30:08</a> - greek words that all get translated generally as love in english there's the divine conditional agape love that god<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1815">30:15</a> - has for us then there's philia or brotherly love the love that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1820">30:20</a> - binds all of us together as brothers and sisters in christ and then there's also storge the familial love a mother might<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1827">30:27</a> - have for her child and there are even other additional types of love lexically represented in greek besides at any rate<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1833">30:33</a> - having the concordance operate on the original languages can help you trace related usages better since you only get<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1839">30:39</a> - direct masters so in this example case we're talking about here if you are looking for passages about agape love<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1845">30:45</a> - with the original language concordance you'll only get direct hits for that type of love rather than philia or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1851">30:51</a> - storge even though an english concordance would lump them all together so don't want to get too off topic there<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1857">30:57</a> - i could easily go on but you kind of get the idea so we've looked at lexicons and the original language concordance tools<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1864">31:04</a> - built into the step bible app windows here now one last point i'm going to go to a content page here to show you how you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1870">31:10</a> - can turn off the embedded bible app windows as well so i'm going to actually go to the content page for the verse by<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1876">31:16</a> - verse study here so i have a page up about genesis chapter one going over the first verse here so i'm going to go<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1882">31:22</a> - ahead and go to this content page and you can see here that we have some embedded bible app windows here where<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1887">31:27</a> - i'm quoting uh genesis 1 and john chapter 1 and actually the septuagint for genesis 1 as well so we have three<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1894">31:34</a> - embedded by block windows here and so the embedded bible app windows might be a bit confusing for some people<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1900">31:40</a> - who would rather just have a simple plain text quote of scripture and so that's actually supported as an option<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1905">31:45</a> - too so for people who aren't interested in some of the functionality we're going over here and would rather just have plain text quotes so things that don't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1911">31:51</a> - get in the way and like if you move your mouse over them you see how the lexicons get pulled up and stuff maybe it's just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1916">31:56</a> - kind of confusing for people and they'd rather turn it off so you're going to actually do that on a per page level by going over here in the sidebar and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1923">32:03</a> - clicking this link here that says toggle embedded and so when you do that you can see that it turns on and off the embedded windows and when the embedded<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1930">32:10</a> - windows are turned off well this is just the hebrew quote here for genesis 1 1. so if you toggle them on you know you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1936">32:16</a> - can look up things in the lexicon for for example this is the word for sky in hebrew shamayim<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1942">32:22</a> - but if you want it off well you can just see the text and you won't have any of that other stuff getting in the way or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1947">32:27</a> - confusing you there and so whichever one you want uh there's not a right or wrong answer but you can go ahead and turn<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1953">32:33</a> - those off at a per page level here in the sidebar now just like other things on the website i'll just go ahead and show you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1959">32:39</a> - here you can actually also go to the settings page and if you go to the settings page you can see that there's a section on the settings page for the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1964">32:44</a> - embedded windows and if you click on one of these buttons here this sets it globally so if you want to only<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1970">32:50</a> - view scripture in embedded windows that's what we have right here you can do that and then if we view it in plain text you'll see i just said it globally<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1976">32:56</a> - and so if i go back to the study here um you'll see that now by default when the page loads unlike before<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1982">33:02</a> - by default when the page loads now the things will not show up as in the embedded by block windows but they'll show up just as the plain text windows<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1988">33:08</a> - and so depending on what settings you pick it lets you turn these things on or off by default here and so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1994">33:14</a> - personally i leave them on but that's because i actually do make use of the functionality for the greek in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=1999">33:19</a> - hebrew that other people may not make use of so that's the embedded bible app windows<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2005">33:25</a> - that we're going over here okay so last thing here we're going to talk about is we're going to go ahead and talk about the subject index that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2012">33:32</a> - the site uses so go ahead and open the last link here so this is what the subject index looks<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2017">33:37</a> - like unlike many other site this site actually supports tagging content at the section level rather than just the page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2023">33:43</a> - level this is much more useful in practice since it means stuff can get added to the subject index with much more precision<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2029">33:49</a> - as an example let's click on this link here in the subject index about spousal abuse so you can see it's tagged we have<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2035">33:55</a> - a parent topic and then a subtopic organized alphabetically here so if we go ahead and we click on this entry in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2041">34:01</a> - the subject index we'll get taken directly to the section on the page and again like i said section not page because this is a subsection of the page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2048">34:08</a> - that it's on but in this subsection here by making it very clear that domestic<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2053">34:13</a> - abuse is clearly and obviously valid grounds for divorce despite some people legalistically trying to ban the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2059">34:19</a> - practice because the bible never states this divorce exception directly at least not in so many words<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2064">34:24</a> - so that's the basic idea of what the section's going over here on spousal abuse but if i move my mouse over here you can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2071">34:31</a> - see that we have this section with the tag icon here and then these tags these are the subjects that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2077">34:37</a> - you'll also see represented in the subject index and so these sections these subjects<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2082">34:42</a> - listed out right underneath the section headers these are actually really important because these right here are links back to the subject index<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2089">34:49</a> - so that is to say the subject indexing on this site is actually bi-directional so the subject index links to sections<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2095">34:55</a> - on the pages and sections on pages linked back to the subject index this is great since it makes things much more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2101">35:01</a> - discoverable since you can go from one section to others talking about the exact same topic with just a click or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2106">35:06</a> - two so if i go back here uh you see this takes me right back to the subject index and if there were anything else tagged<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2112">35:12</a> - with the same thing i'd be able to immediately go to the other section with just a couple clicks so this is really really cool and one of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2119">35:19</a> - my favorite features out of all the things that i custom developed for this site is being able to have the bi-directional subject tagging on all of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2125">35:25</a> - the sections uh something that not many other websites support as far as i've seen and something that i think works<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2131">35:31</a> - really well so that's just my selfish plug for it well i know that was a lot but that concludes all of our discussion<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2137">35:37</a> - of website content and resources so now we're going to move into talking about the community and the meetings that our<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2143">35:43</a> - community has fortunately discussion of these things should go a lot faster since there's a lot less overall to get through here so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2150">35:50</a> - supporting a community for this website was another big priority of mine i do answer questions over email and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2157">35:57</a> - that's discussed on the homepage of the website but that's not quite the same as actually having a community<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2162">36:02</a> - actually having another group of believers to talk to and grow side by side with one another that's a really<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2168">36:08</a> - big blessing so because i believe that i kind of set out to get everything in place for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2174">36:14</a> - having such a community entirely mediated through options on the internet<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2179">36:19</a> - so anyone who's interested in participating across the entire world if we do it this way will be able to participate<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2185">36:25</a> - so i actually set this up a little bit before i launched the website and thus far it's turned out pretty great<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2190">36:30</a> - we have a self-hosted private forum as well as whatsapp groups for more casual chats<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2196">36:36</a> - through these platforms i've met and made friends with believers from all around the world<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2201">36:41</a> - for example one of my closest christian friends now lives in nigeria and the other one's from australia<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2207">36:47</a> - i never would have met these people if it hadn't been for the community here that we're about to talk about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2212">36:52</a> - so this link here on the next slide takes us to the community overview page which documents all of the stuff about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2218">36:58</a> - our community in great detail now there's a lot on this page as you can see you know lots of documentation<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2225">37:05</a> - about how everything works but again probably going to be easier to show more than tell<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2230">37:10</a> - so for that reason i'm actually going to go ahead and click this link on the sidebar which will take us to the forums<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2237">37:17</a> - so this is what the login page for the forum looks like and as soon as i log in i will be right<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2242">37:22</a> - back all right so once you've logged in this is what the community looks like so we have all of the normal things on web<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2249">37:29</a> - forms we have a list of threads here and each thread can have multiple posts and you can see you know multiple replies on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2255">37:35</a> - these threads and you know we have a community prayer request thread and announcements thread and plenty of other<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2261">37:41</a> - threads on various topics here and uh so this is what the community looks like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2267">37:47</a> - not too too much to say because it's basically just like any other form supporting all of the things that i just talked about and you know direct<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2273">37:53</a> - messages and all of that other great stuff besides but it's the people on the forum that make it special so our community has<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2280">38:00</a> - individuals from all genders ages and cultures in its ranks all striving to grow in the truth side by side with one<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2286">38:06</a> - another it's a beautiful thing and we do have well maybe uh 40 people signed up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2291">38:11</a> - for the forum or something like that at the time this video is being made and you know some people post more than others but<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2297">38:17</a> - it's a community where we all do grow and support one another in the truth now next i'm going to talk about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2303">38:23</a> - whatsapp and the whatsapp arm of our community a little bit i don't really have a great way to show<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2308">38:28</a> - the whatsapp group on my screen recording at the moment but it works just like other whatsapp groups do too<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2313">38:33</a> - whatsapp is the other main platform we use to communicate with one another in the community and is probably quite a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2318">38:38</a> - bit less formal overall than the forum is so whatsapp a little bit more casual conversations in real time form a little<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2325">38:45</a> - bit more structured because that way we can link back to conversations we've had and organized our thoughts with the organization<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2331">38:51</a> - features that the forum offers now the last community related thing that i'm going to be talking about here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2337">38:57</a> - is how to join at the very bottom of the community overview page on the site there's a registration form that looks<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2342">39:02</a> - like this if you click the link directly above the form that's this link this will take you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2347">39:07</a> - to the general instructions for filling out the forms there's the section right above it on the page then if you don't know what the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2353">39:13</a> - different community sections are the link on the form itself will take you to the section on the page that explains them<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2359">39:19</a> - so if you don't know what the community sections are you can click this link here and this will take you up to the top of the page<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2364">39:24</a> - but that will help explain which community sections might be a good fit for you and so filling out this form<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2370">39:30</a> - this is how you join the community attached to this ministry and actually while we're on the topic of signing up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2375">39:35</a> - for things let me here go over the site's mailing list too now there's a link in the sidebar menu that takes you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2380">39:40</a> - to a page explaining it or you can actually also sign up for the mailing list on the homepage too but for the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2385">39:45</a> - time being we're going to go ahead and click the link in the sidebar to show the mailing list so here's what the signup form for the mailing list looks<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2391">39:51</a> - like and if you sign up for the mailing list using this form on this page you'll<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2396">39:56</a> - get an email from me going over news from this ministry and from the community probably one<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2402">40:02</a> - email every couple weeks so it's a good way to keep abreast of what's going on even if you don't get much more involved<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2408">40:08</a> - than that all right finally coming to the last thing here for today now we're going to go over the meetings our community has<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2414">40:14</a> - every week so this link here takes you to the community meetings page on the site so we'll go ahead and open it up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2421">40:21</a> - so as you can see right at the top here we have a quick reference section that contains an embedded google calendar<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2426">40:26</a> - showing all of our meetings and so this is the google calendar that shows all the meetings here and then if you scroll<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2432">40:32</a> - down a bit there's also an embedded map and this map will take you right to my house where the in-person side of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2438">40:38</a> - meetings are held now if we keep scrolling a bit you'll see that there's a section going over the zoom side as well so you don't have<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2445">40:45</a> - to be in person to participate in our meetings because while we do have the in-person side that meets at my house<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2450">40:50</a> - all of the meetings are also fully tied into zoom that way people who are local can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2457">40:57</a> - drop by locally to join us for our meetings but actually even people around the world no matter<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2462">41:02</a> - where they may be can participate in our meetings too because we do integrate everything with zoom<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2467">41:07</a> - and so the link to join over zoom can be accessed on the forum and so anyone who's joined the forum will be able to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2474">41:14</a> - join our zoom meetings by clicking on the link and i also send it out in the global whatsapp group so the the widest<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2480">41:20</a> - distribution whatsapp group associated with our community before every meeting so if people want to join from the link<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2485">41:25</a> - on the whatsapp group both of those options are ways that you can get the zoom link to join our meetings now we don't post it publicly just because that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2492">41:32</a> - way it's easier to ensure our privacy and make sure that if we need to change it ever due to a bad actor getting a hold of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2499">41:39</a> - link while it's easy for us to change it and then redistribute it in those channels there all right so last thing to talk about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2506">41:46</a> - here is the types of meetings we have so up here we're looking right now at the section going over bible study meetings<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2512">41:52</a> - so our community has two main types of meetings the first type here are the bible studies for these i teach through<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2518">41:58</a> - some pre-prepared content for a time and then we have a period of questions and discussion these are pretty formal and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2524">42:04</a> - stay very organized and on topic now if we scroll down a bit we'll see the other type of meetings that our<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2529">42:09</a> - community has here the fellowship meetings so the fellowship meetings are less formal and we mostly chat with one<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2536">42:16</a> - another about what's going on in each other's lives all while keeping the bible in view encouraging and exhorting<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2541">42:21</a> - one another with the truth we also sometimes get pretty off topic about whatever catches our fancy in a given<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2546">42:26</a> - week if you are interested in casually hanging out with other christians while getting to know each other better through a shared passion for the truth<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2553">42:33</a> - that's what these fellowship meetings are all about well we made it so i know that was a lot<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2558">42:38</a> - to get through but hopefully now you have a good grasp of all the things that this ministry is setting out to do now<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2564">42:44</a> - i'm always available for questions if you have them either things from this whirlwind overview any of the things we<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2569">42:49</a> - talked about here any of the things documented on the other documentation pages i mentioned on the website or of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2575">42:55</a> - course just bible questions in general because as the home page of the site makes clear i do answer questions just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2581">43:01</a> - general questions about passages or interpretation things like that over email and my email address is also<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2588">43:08</a> - on the home page of the site but you know i can just say it here too it's steven at bibledocs.org<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2593">43:13</a> - and that's steven with a v not a ph so last thing uh before we close out<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2598">43:18</a> - here i do appreciate any signal boosting that people can give so uh like this video on youtube subscribe<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2604">43:24</a> - to the youtube channel like the facebook page follow me on twitter for this ministry all of those sorts of things<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2611">43:31</a> - doing that sort of helps the content algorithms uh you know it helps me rank higher in terms of visibility and so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2617">43:37</a> - that means more people might be able to hear about some of the things offered here so if you're interested and you have the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2623">43:43</a> - time if you could go ahead and do some of those things on the social media and the youtube page and all that it really<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2629">43:49</a> - would help in terms of making the things offered here more discoverable for others and of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVKDoAWI_20&t=2634">43:54</a> - course if you have friends and family who you think would be interested sharing word of mouth too um again you don't have to blast it you don't have to<br/>
