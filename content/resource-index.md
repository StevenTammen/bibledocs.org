This page starts with a [section explaining why I strongly recommend doing Bible study on the computer](#i-strongly-recommend-using-digital-resources-for-bible-study). Next comes an [explanation of what Bible software programs I use and recommend and why](#which-bible-software-program-and-why), a [section explaining a few exceptions to the general rule](#exceptions-to-the-logos-only-approach) based on resource availability, and then a [section explaining how I link to electronic resources](#linking-to-and-citing-resources) using the APIs of Bible software programs (and explaining how I cite those few paper resources I am still forced to use).

[Finally comes the actual resource index](#resource-index), which is a table that lists all the main Bible study resources I use and thus link to on this site.

## I strongly recommend using digital resources for Bible study

I *highly*, *highly* recommend doing all your Bible study on the computer. There are many reasons for this, even more than just this brief (very much non-exhaustive) list:

1. Verse references (including not only normal textual cross-references, but also those verse references showing up in study Bibles, Bible handbooks, and so on) can be instantly displayed on screen with hyperlinks. *Instantly*. No more paging through Bibles to look up verses ever again. Links can also exist between resources (so, e.g., a technical commentary can link to a reference lexicon and/or a grammar), letting you immediately jump to the material referenced rather than having to open up a separate paper book and paw through it. The ability to hyperlink saves an almost incalculable amount of time in the long term.
1. More than just hyperlinks between reference resources, digital Bibles are also completely crosslinked with lexicons: click on any word in the Biblical text to pull up the underlying Greek or Hebrew lexicon entry. Digital Bibles are also morphologically tagged (so you can hover over a Greek verb to immediately check the person, number, tense, mood, and voice, for example).
1. Digital original language concordances (showing all occurrences of a particular Greek or Hebrew lemma across the entire Bible) can be accessed instantly with a click or two.
1. Digital lexicons and digital original language concordances can be used even by people who can't read a lick of Greek or Hebrew -- they just click on an English word to pull up the Greek/Hebrew lexicon entry or concordance entry. Contrast these same sorts of resources in print, which absolutely require knowledge of the original languages due to the fact that words are organized/indexed alphabetically.
1. You can jump to anywhere in the Bible as easily as typing in the verse reference (extremely useful when jumping between reading sections in a daily Bible reading plan; I personally read from several sections of the Bible daily, although many people often do less, like just OT and NT). You can jump straight to a Bible dictionary or encyclopedia article (on a person or a place, for example) by typing in the title of the article. You get the idea: navigating digital resources effectively takes no time... unlike paper resources.
1. Reference resources like Bible dictionaries can be kept in sync. So, for example, if you jump to an article on Saul in one Bible dictionary, all the other dictionaries and encyclopedias will automatically jump to their own articles on Saul, making comparisons instantaneous. This is a biggie.
1. Having all your Bible study resources on the computer makes copy-pasting possible when making personal notes or annotations (like those you might otherwise make in the margins of paper Bibles), and also greatly enhances note-taking efficiency since typing (and especially voice-recognition, if you have a program like [Dragon by Nuance](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html) for it) is *way* faster than handwriting (in this latter case, ~200 WPM vs. ~20 WPM). I've found that switching to computer-based Bible study has vastly increased the number and usefulness of my own personal notes on scripture.
1. Having all your Bible study resources on the computer means you can have them with you absolutely everywhere. Try carrying around paper copies of eight different Bible versions, a concordance, multiple Bible dictionaries, etc., and you'll figure out pretty fast why it's great to have everything on your laptop or tablet!
1. Parallel Bible versions (e.g., the UBS5 Greek text and NASB English text) can be seamlessly kept in sync for easy parallel reading.
1. Interlinears and reverse interlinears can be shown and hidden with the click of a button.
1. Parallel texts (English Bible versions, but also Greek and Hebrew texts) can be displayed one on top of the other with differences visually highlighted. This makes textual comparisons and comparisons between different versions *way* faster.


All of these advantages (and even more like them not listed here) are huge, and cannot be had in print. The instant display of verse references is especially important. It is a complete gamechanger.

### In my opinion, the primary downsides of digital resources can be effectively mitigated

#### Distractions from social media, etc.

The largest downside that people report of doing Bible study on electronic devices -- that they get easily distracted (be it from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube, Netflix, Reddit, or whatever else) in a way that they can't with paper Bible study resources -- is *completely avoidable* if you use web filtering software to block all internet access except for those sites and applications you use when doing Bible study. I use and recommend [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) for doing this on computers, and I use an app on my Android phone called [Stay Focused](https://www.stayfocused.me/) to accomplish the same. What works best for me is to schedule times of the day for Bible study when I only have access to Bible study resources (so that I set aside these times once in the blocking applications, and then let them automatically block things every day thereafter without daily input from me).

#### Reading on screens

Some people also complain that reading on screens has inherent disadvantages:

1. It tires their eyes out more than paper resources.
2. They don't learn as well as when they read paper resources.

As to the first claim, there is some evidence that the blue light emitted from LED screens can affect circadian rhythms (via melatonin suppression) and potentially cause more eyestrain. You can block (or at least limit) blue light with an app called [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). There is also some evidence that reading on a bright screen in a completely dark room (i.e., not matching screen brightness to room brightness) can create higher levels of eyestrain than paper resources that simply reflect ambient light. You can avoid this problem by always using your computer in good light (the same sort of circumstance you would read a paper book in). Taking a break every half hour or so to get and up and get a drink (e.g.) to rest your eyes -- a good habit to get into regardless -- also effectively mitigates all problems in this area.

As to the second claim, to date, there has been no methodologically rigorous peer-reviewed study that I am aware of that has conclusively shown that this statement is true *when comparing apples to apples*. Many people are accustomed to "skimming" webpages (definitely not helpful in terms of content retention) -- but this is in no way inherent to reading on screens. (So, for example, you can just choose not to do it when seriously studying).

Further, while it true that scrolling causes more cognitive load than flipping a page, almost all Bible study applications allow you to read text page by page anyhow (exactly like paper), and it is possible to do effectively the same on webpages using PageUp and PageDown along with a browser extension that helps you keep track of the bottom of the page. I use a Chrome extension called [Scroll Marker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scroll-marker/jdoinodpdahlmpgmpmhonheidpjhhnid) for this purpose. In fact, having the ability to *either* scroll when skimming text (looking at headings, for example -- extremely useful in quickly getting an overview of a page or looking for something specific) *or* read in-depth screen-by-screen (like this extension allows) literally allows you to have the best of both worlds, with no downsides. (The reason why I recommend a browser extension for this rather than coding it into this website myself is because if you use an extension, you can use it across *all* websites, including Ichthys).

In short there is no mechanism that has been explained as to how paper books are magically better than reading on screens. If you take pains to read on screens the same way you read physical books (not skimming, paging rather than scrolling most of the time), there is essentially no difference between the mediums in this specific regard.

### Sharing digital resources is possible

An important point to make is that Bible software accounts can typically be shared among members of an immediate family (like a spouse) if you meet the terms of use, which usually boil down to something like "we are not lawyers, but if usage is in line with that of a single person, corresponding roughly to only one instance of the software being used at a time, you are probably OK."

The official legalese typically reads something like: "[Company] grants to you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use one copy of the Product on up to some (or perhaps any) number of supported devices that you own or control."

Compare: [Logos](https://community.logos.com/forums/p/341/3265.aspx#3265) (this is a forum post from the CEO), [Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com/Legal#single), [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/press/privacy.php#eula). The general sentiment seems to be that if both you and your spouse are heavy users who teach and do a lot of research, you should probably duplicate resources across two separate accounts to be ethical, since you function more like two users. On the other hand, if one person is a heavy user and the other person only occasionally uses the software -- and the software is only used on the shared family computer, e.g. -- you are not really being unethical by being on one account.

### Conclusion: digital resources are incredibly useful and should not be forgone lightly

A lot of folks have been reading their paper Bibles and using paper concordances (e.g.) for decades. Transitioning to doing things on the computer may feel a bit unfamiliar and uncomfortable.

Despite the discomfort, it is my recommendation both as an individual and as a Bible teacher that people give it a real, fair chance. The  benefits of doing Bible study on the computer instead of with paper resources are so great in magnitude, in fact, that it is my belief that I would actually be remiss as a teacher if I did not strongly recommend using them.

Some older folks who have difficulties with computers may be a special exception, but as a general rule, it is my belief that most people will benefit enormously from the digital tools for Bible study that we now have available to us.

People should, of course, still make their own decisions in areas of application like this.

## Which Bible software program and why?

Since [BibleWorks](https://www.bibleworks.com/) closed its doors in 2018, the main three Bible software options are [Logos](https://www.logos.com/), [Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com/), and [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/). There are various other options, but these three are the biggest with most users (important for long-term availability; compare BibleWorks above) and most overall functionality (including apps for all major desktop and mobile operating systems).

Note that whichever program you pick, I recommend steering away from large collections/base packages (e.g., [these](https://www.logos.com/compare-packages) in Logos, [these](https://www.accordancebible.com/Collections-Comparison) in Accordance). Under the pretense of getting a good deal, these marketing ploys in reality get you a few good resources and a whole lot of things that are mostly useless (such as expensive commentary collections). The better approach is to only buy those things that you will actually use; you should have a clear and defined reason for purchasing each and every resource you buy. Note that even if you buy the complete set of resources I personally use (not at all needed for the vast majority of all Christians who are not teachers), you will still come out money ahead relative to many of these large collections, and will have a much, much more useful reference library.

I own almost all of my Bible study resources in Logos. At some point I'll expand this section, but for now here's the shortlist of reasons why this is so:

* Logos, along with Accordance, offers lots of advanced functionality. OliveTree is also excellent (and it probably has the cleanest interface of the three), but it trails the others in advanced functionality, in my experience. If you are a more casual user, any of the three generally work well in terms of functionality, but if you want more, you should go with either Logos or Accordance.
* Logos is the only one of the three to offer proper hyperlinking capability. I make heavy use of this in my own personal Bible notes/journal, and also in my published teaching on this site. Linking directly to resources in Logos removes essentially all barrier to referencing other texts -- even multi-volume Bible dictionaries, for example -- *which is absolutely huge*. Hyperlinks have always been one of the internet's strongest points, but citing rather than linking things (e.g., books) is a pain both for the person making the citation and the person following the citation. Direct links, by contrast, make citation unnecessary, and save everyone lots of time in the long run.
  * Linking to specific places in an electronic text is something that even Kindle books do not generally support. The hyperlinking ability of Logos is where I would like to see *all* digital texts heading in the future. Being able to directly link sections of formal academic and reference books (in addition to webpages) greatly increases convenience for both writers and readers of citation-heavy content.
* Logos is the only one of the three to offer a full webapp. As long as you have an internet connection, you can access your full Logos library from anywhere in the world, even on some computer that is not yours. This may not be useful all that often, but it is definitely useful.
* While all three Bible software programs run sales and promotional events, usually they are just 10%-off-your-order coupons and things of this sort. (I *highly* recommend waiting for a sitewide 20+% coupon before spending any substantial amount of money, no matter which program). Logos is the only one of the three to actually give monetary vouchers -- $20 on your birthday every year. This isn't earth-shattering, but if you stick with the software, this amounts to hundreds of dollars of free resources over the years.
* There are some resources in Accordance that you can only get as part of a package. While this may be true for some Logos resources too (?), I have never personally come across it, while I have come across multiple examples of things I would wish to buy individually in Accordance but cannot (e.g., [Smith's Bible Dictionary](https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=Smith%26%23039%3Bs+Dictionary)).
* Logos has the biggest overall library out of the three programs. This may not seem like all that big a deal because, as explained below, there are still some things that you can get in only one of the three programs anyway (so I have all three installed and regularly use all three), but it *is* important in terms of content synchronization. Let's say you were to own one Bible dictionary in Logos, and a different one in Accordance. If you were to own both of them in one program or the other you would be able to synchronize the resources, but you can't across programs. In general then, it is best to own all resources of a given type in the same program. The advantage Logos has is that since it has more resources, you won't ever have to split programs like this. Here's some examples of things only in Logos:
  * Logos has [Abbott-Smith's Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament](https://www.logos.com/product/31160/abbott-smiths-manual-greek-lexicon-of-the-new-testament), an excellent concise lexicon that helps illuminate the Hebrew behind many Greek words. It is convenient to be able to sync this with other Greek lexicons (Middle Liddell, BDAG, etc.)
  * Logos has [Zerwick's A Grammatical Analysis of the Greek New Testament](https://www.logos.com/product/4229/a-grammatical-analysis-of-the-greek-new-testament) and [its accompanying grammar](https://www.logos.com/product/7853/biblical-greek-illustrated-by-examples), a pair of resources that is enormously helpful for picking up speed in reading the New Testament (highly, highly recommended -- almost essential for intermediate students of Greek, in my opinion). It is convenient to be able to sync this with other technical Greek commentaries (e.g., [Meyer's Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament](https://www.logos.com/product/9847/critical-and-exegetical-commentary-on-the-new-testament)).
  * Logos has [Jastrow's Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature](https://www.logos.com/product/16534/dictionary-of-the-targumim-the-talmud-babli-and-yerushalmi-and-the-midrashic-literature), a reference lexicon for Talmudic studies. Standard Hebrew reference lexicons (BDB, TWOT, HALOT) don't fully cut it for the Talmud and other rabbanic writings, making Jastrow's an excellent supplement to have around. It is convenient to be able to sync this with the more conventional Hebrew lexicons.

One could go on. There aren't really all that many more examples of clear resource superiority in Logos since all three programs have most of the really important resources:

* All the main English Bibles, along with interlinears and reverse interlinears
* The standard Greek texts of the New Testament (UBS5, NA28)
* The standard Greek lexicons (Thayer's, Middle Lidell, BDAG, LSJ)
* The standard Hebrew texts of the Old Testament (BHS, BHQ)
* The standard Hebrew lexicons (BDB, TWOT, HALOT)
* The standard academic reference Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias (Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary, ISBE1995)
* Etc.

Logos does have a few other reference resources that the others don't (e.g., [Walker's A History of the Christian Church](https://www.logos.com/product/34030/a-history-of-the-christian-church), [Thiessen's Lectures in Systematic Theology](https://www.logos.com/product/7549/lectures-in-systematic-theology)), but since resources like these don't really sync with anything, it isn't so important what program you own them in as long as scripture references are tagged (contrast digital books not in Bible study programs, like Kindle books). Owning them in Logos does give you the benefits of hyperlinking and the webapp though, as above.

## Exceptions to the Logos-only approach

While it would be great if we could stick with one and only one Bible software program for everything, that is not presently possible, as some resources I use are available only in OliveTree or Accordance. Thus, some categories of resources are handled in OliveTree or Accordance rather than Logos, despite Logos' advantages.

### Study Bible(s) and Bible handbooks: OliveTree

Unfortunately, Neither Logos nor Accordance have my study Bible of choice (The [NIV Study Bible, edited by Kenneth Barker](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=59059)), or my Bible handbook of choice ([The New Unger's Bible Handbook](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17343)). OliveTree, however, has both. Adding [Halley's Bible Handbook](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=42724) rounds out the three general-background resources I recommend running in-line with scripture.

### Topical resources: OliveTree

The topical resources most people are familiar with (Nave's, Torrey's, etc.) act like dictionaries: you have to search for a term to pull it up. So if you are reading Joshua 1:1 and decide that you want to see verses about Joshua, you need to manually search the topical resources for "Joshua." Is this a big deal? No. Is it inconvenient? A bit.

It turns out that there exist topical resources that serve as more of a "two way street" between topics and verses: the dictionary portion links to verses, and the verses in turn link to the dictionary portion. Thus, if you scroll them in-line with a Bible, you can immediately jump to a verse list for a topic when coming upon said topic in your reading.

Some resources also support "chains" of verses, where you jump from one verse in the chain to the next sequentially to see how a theme develops over the course of a book (for example). These typically also allow you to jump straight to the main verse list for the topic in the dictionary portion of the resource, as above. All of these features add some additional value over the basic topical indices, so they can be good resources to acquire eventually. In terms of general resource options along these lines, there are two:

1. The Thompson Chain Reference Bible
1. The Dictionary of Bible Themes

Logos doesn't even offer the former, and Logos' implementation of the latter cannot be scrolled alongside scripture (despite having topical listings verse-by-verse). Accordance actually offers the former, but just like Logos, its implementation of the latter cannot be scrolled alongside scripture.

In OliveTree, both of the above resources can be scrolled alongside scripture, and the OliveTree folks also made their own threaded topical resource (that is obviously not available in the other two programs). Thus, for topical resources, I recommend people buy the [Thompson Chain Reference Bible](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17248), the [Dictionary of Bible Themes](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=21231), and the [Olive Tree Bible Topic Threads](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=40654) in OliveTree.

### Greek manuscript/papyri transcriptions for textual criticism: Accordance

Logos offers [a transcription of Sinaiticus](https://www.logos.com/product/35581/codex-sinaiticus), but that's it on the uncial side of things. (You can get the main papyri in Logos just fine via [Comfort and Barrett's The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts](https://www.logos.com/product/7855/the-text-of-the-earliest-new-testament-greek-manuscripts)).

Accordance [offers more MSS in addition to Sinaiticus and the papyri](https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=Codex+add-on), most noticeably Vaticanus, Alexandrinus, and Codex Bezae. Of [the great uncial codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_uncial_codices), Accordance only lacks [Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Ephraemi_Rescriptus).

Logos and OliveTree simply have no equivalent resources, so Accordance it is for these transcriptions. For the purposes of text comparisons, it makes sense to get the papyri too in Accordance rather than Logos (i.e., even though they are offered in both, it's best to get them in Accordance where the uncial transcriptions are, so that you can compare the papyri with the uncial transcriptions).

Other Greek textual criticism resources (apparatuses, Metzger's commentary) work fine in either program, but due to Logos' advantages, I still recommend getting them in Logos. It's only the transcriptions that I recommend Accordance for.

### Miscellaneous reference works that are not in Bible software programs: other sources

Despite my overwhelming preference for digital resources in Bible software programs, some of the resources I use simply are not available in any Bible software program, and many of these are not even digitized at all. This is partly because I tend to favor older resources that are more conservative in outlook and hold scripture in higher authority. (Newer releases from the age of computers basically all have digital versions, but it takes effort to digitize older works, particularly really old ones).

If I can find an ePub or Kindle version of a resource, that is second best (no verse tagging and cross-resource hyperlinks as in Bible software programs, but at least these have display that can be customized with respect to font and font-size, have text that can be copied and pasted, and so on). Then, in order of decreasing preference: scanned images and/or PDFs as might be found on [archive.org](http://archive.org/) (at least I can have these on my tablet rather than having to lug them around), modern (re)publications (typically have better bindings and clearer printing; I favor hardcover resources for durability), and then, finally, well-maintained used copies of out-of-print titles.

A list, in no particular order, of resources I own external to the Bible software programs:

* Unger's Commentary on the Old Testament; used out of print book, hardcover
* Unger's Commentary on the Gospels; modern print book, hardcover

<!--
### Do later: Greek and Hebrew audio by verse: Accordance

Hebrew audio only available in Accordance

https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=Hebrew%20Audio-OT

Greek audio is in both, so I recommend getting that one in Logos. Also cheaper, superior because it highlights text when it plays.

https://www.logos.com/product/26968/greek-audio-new-testament#Reviews
https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=GNT%20Audio

But check on slowing audio down in accordance. Can;t do in Logos since matched with highlighting text? Know you can do it in Accordance, so stick with both in Accordance?

## Linking to and citing resources

As mentioned above, one key advantage of Logos is that it supports full hyperlinks to its resources. Unfortunately, neither Accordance nor OliveTree offers this functionality.

OliveTree, however, does [have an API for jumping to specific verses by hyperlink](https://github.com/OliveTreeBible/OliveTreeUrlExample), which is at least better than nothing. It so happens that all of the resources I use and recommend for OliveTree are scrolled in-line with scripture, such that it is possible to reference them in this somewhat-roundabout way. What I mean by this will become clearer below.

I create the link text for different resource links a bit differently, so give pertinent examples of all the types here.

Note that I use resource abbreviations (or at least partial abbreviations) quite frequently. If you ever come across a resource abbreviation that you are unfamiliar with, you can search for it in the [resource index below](#resource-index) to find the resource it is associated with.

<!-- TODO: comments on citing webpage resources from Ichthys, Freebiblecommentaries, Bible Crash Course, Bible Academy. Add these things to table -->

### Biblical texts

The links are constructed as {Text} > {Verse}.

I create link text for bibilical texts all the same way, be they English Bible versions or Greek or Hebrew texts.

Examples:

* [NASB > Romans 5:12](https://ref.ly/logosres/nasb95para?ref=BibleNASB95.Ro5.12)
* [NA28 > John 3:16](https://ref.ly/logosres/na28?ref=BibleNA27.Jn3.16)
* [BHS > Genesis 1:27](https://ref.ly/logosres/bhssesb?ref=BibleBHS.Ge1.27)

### Lexicons

The links are constructed as {Lexicon} > {Lemma}.

Examples:

* [BDAG > ἀγάπη](https://ref.ly/logosres/bdag?hw=%CE%B1%CC%93%CE%B3%CE%B1%CC%81%CF%80%CE%B7)
* [BDB > בָּרָא](https://ref.ly/logosres/bdb?hw=%D7%91%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%A8%D6%B8%D7%90)


### Study Bible notes, Bible handbooks

The links are constructed as {In-line Resource} > {Verse}.

These resources are OliveTree resources, meaning direct links are not possible; the best I can do is link to a specific verse, which will navigate you there in OliveTree. You can then open the in-line resource, which will automatically sync to the verse's location. This is a bit indirect, but it actually adds very little time in practice.

Examples:

- [NIV Study Bible > Romans 3:23](olivetree://bible/romans.8.28)
- [Unger's Bible Handbook > Micah 6:8](olivetree://bible/micah.6.8)
- [Halley's Bible Handbook > Philippians 4:13](olivetree://bible/philippians.4.13)

### Topical resources

The links are constructed as {In-line Topical Resource} > {Verse} > {Topic}.

These are OliveTree resources too. Generally, what it is desirable to link to is the verse listing for a specific topic. Unfortunately, since OliveTree does not support full hyperlinks, this is not possible to do directly.

However, we can do this indirectly, just as we got to the in-line resources indirectly above. We just have one more step here: once you arrive at a specific verse in an in-line topical resource, you'll need to click on the appropriate topic to jump to the full verse listing for that topic. This adds a couple seconds, but it is still really not all that inconvenient. In the future, if OliveTree ever got support for full hyperlinks, even this slight inconvenience could be eliminated.

Examples:

* [Thompson Chain Reference > John 3:16 > 2206 God's Love](olivetree://bible/john.3.16)
* [Dictionary of Bible Themes > Romans 3:23 > sin, *universality* 6023](olivetree://bible/romans.3.23)
* [Olive Tree Bible Topic Threads > Ephesians 2:8 > Grace](olivetree://bible/ephesians.2.8)

### Commentaries

The links are constructed as {Commentary} > {Verse}.

Examples:

* [Meyer's Commentary > 1 Corinthians 4:6](https://ref.ly/logosres/critexe67co01?ref=Bible.1Co4.6)
* [Keil and Delitzsch > Isaiah 5:1](https://ref.ly/logosres/kdotcomm?ref=BibleBHS.Is5.1-2)

### Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias

The links are constructed as {Reference Work} > {Topic}.

Examples:

* [AYBD > Nebuchadnezzar](https://ref.ly/logosres/anch?hw=Nebuchadnezzar)
* [ISBE1995 > Assyria](https://ref.ly/logosres/isbe?hw=Assyria)

### Digital reference books

The links are constructed as {Reference Book} > {Section} (if a specific section is in view) or {Reference Book} > {Location} (if the link is to a specific page/paragraph).

These sorts of links encompass more general reference works that aren't organized by verse or topic -- books, in other words. Works on systematic theology, church history, and so forth are thus linked in this way.

Examples:

* [Chafer's Systematic Theology > The Divine Program of the Ages](https://ref.ly/logosres/chafersysth?ref=VolumePage.V+1%2c+p+xi&off=1193)
* [Schaff's Church History > Volume 7, Page 98](https://ref.ly/logosres/schaff?ref=VolumePage.V+7%2c+p+98&off=139)
* [Walker's Church History > Page 57](https://ref.ly/logosres/hstchrschr?ref=Page.p+57&off=1446)

### Resources external to Bible software

Things that I can actually link (e.g., a PDF of something on [archive.org](https://archive.org/)) I do. Otherwise, the link is where to purchase the resource (or at least one option for such -- I generally prioritize Amazon links).

The links are constructed here on more of an ad-hoc basis. Reference books external to Bible software programs are cited in essentially the same way as those that are in them ([as above](#digital-reference-books)), that is, sometimes by section and sometimes by page number.

## Resource index

Note that some of these resources (the older ones out of copyright) may be found for free on the internet. Purchasing everything in Logos allows for full resource syncing, which saves a lot of time in the long run.

**Important Note**: the vast majority of Christians do not need a reference library nearly as large as this. If you are someone with academic-focused teaching gifts (like myself), then most everything in this table will be useful to you. Most people in the body of Christ need far less. I document my recommended resources for different groups of Christians in separate write-ups [linked on the Links page](/links/#bible-study-resources).

Explanations regarding resource selection (i.e., justifications for using and recommending all these resources) are found on these group-specific pages. The table below is just an index for reference.
