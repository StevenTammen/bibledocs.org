title: Address Book

## Overview

This page contains an address book of my Christian contacts. Not all the folks here are necessarily on board with the teachings of this ministry and [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) (e.g., I have some Eastern Orthodox friends), but some are. People that are "in network" (compare the In-Network column below) are either followers of this ministry or one of the other related ministries [I recommend on the Links page](/links/#links-to-other-teaching-ministries-teachers) (Ichthys, Bible Academy, Bible Crash Course, etc.), and will be better contacts for those looking for fellowship within this wider community of networked ministries that share similar teachings.

The idea in maintaining this list is that I can act as a middleman to put people in contact with each other. Most contacts in this address book are anonymous (no publicly visible name or email), although if you are comfortable being publicly listed in this address book you can email me ([steven@bibledocs.org](mailto:steven@bibledocs.org)) to let me know, and I'll then deanonymize you.

You are also welcome to email me to check if you are presently (anonymously) included in this address book and/or to request that you be added; since there is some lag time on my end sometimes (and I am of course an imperfect human being), it is possible that I've missed some people I know. I also encourage anyone who wants to be a bit more "hands-on" with their own information listing in this address book to reach out and let me know what you want the Job/Occupation Expertise and Other Tags columns to be for you specifically.

### The structure of the address book and procedure for connecting people

The Job/Occupation Expertise column details the education and/or career field of a person, and the Other Tags column contains a short list of their other areas of background and/or passion. If you are interested in some life path/career question ("how do I successfully navigate graduate school in math and science fields?"), some ministry information ("any advice in ministering to college students through an organized campus ministry?") or even just some topic ("I want some serious Christians to talk about philosophy with!"), then you can use these columns to see if there is someone in my network who might be a good contact for you.

If you reach out to me with something along the lines of "could you put me in contact with Person 15 since I want to ask a question about their experience in X?" I will then privately email Person 15 with a bit of information about you, and then if they are interested, I'll CC both of you on an email to make the introduction. (After this point y'all can communicate completely independently from me).

While I do include a location column for the express purpose of facilitating the meeting of people who are geographically proximate to each other (for people who are interested in this), the procedure for people interested in meeting someone from the list locally is not any different from what I described just above. That is, if you want to know if a person located near you is down for meeting in person, you should still email me expressing interest in such, and just as above, if both parties are amenable, I'll make the introduction via email (after which point my participation in the process is again completely optional -- I don't need to know meeting details, for example).
