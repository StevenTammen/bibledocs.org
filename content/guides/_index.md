This section contains pages with embedded video guides on various topics, like using Bible study software. Video makes more sense than text as a medium for guides, but there are still various benefits to having the videos live on pages on my website rather than only showing up on YouTube (see [/site/frequently-asked-questions/#why-pages-for-video-guides](/site/frequently-asked-questions/#why-pages-for-video-guides)).

I highly recommend that if you wish to link to any of my guides, you link to the guide pages on my website rather than directly to the YouTube videos. You can read more about why I recommend such in the above link.
