   So, you've decided to start doing Bible study on the computer, and you are willing to spend some money on resources rather than just sticking with free options. But what Bible software program should you use and buy resources in? I don't pretend to be able to answer this definitively in any capacity (different people have different needs and desires, after all), but this page does set out to explain why I ended up settling on Logos Bible Software rather than one of the other alternatives.

## Free Bible software vs. paid Bible software

Note that most people will be absolutely fine sticking with free Bible study resources (I generally recommend the [STEP Bible app](https://www.stepbible.org/) offered by Tyndale House, and verse-tagged reference works from [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/) -- see the [Links page](/site/links/#links-related-to-personal-bible-study)). However, there is no way around the fact that free Bible software lacks functionality compared to paid software that has a full-time team of software developers working on it. The gap today in this area is smaller than ever before (e.g., the STEP Bible app linked above has much of the most important functionality and is completely free), but it is still there.

More importantly, paid software supports paid resources (in fact, that's where most of the cost comes from). Free Bible software is inherently limited by the fact that its available resource pool consist only of things that are either in the public domain or freely released (like the [NET Bible](https://netbible.com/about/)). This is more limiting by far than any functionality disparity.

All Christians -- from very new believers all the way through seasoned Bible teachers with decades of experience -- can benefit from paid resources... and therefore from Bible software that serves as the picture frame, as it were, for these paid resources.

The question, then, is which picture frame is best?

## The main paid Bible software programs

Since [BibleWorks](https://www.bibleworks.com/) closed its doors in 2018, the main three paid Bible software options are [Logos](https://www.logos.com/), [Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com/), and [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/). There are various other options, but these three are the biggest with most users (important for long-term availability; compare the demise of BibleWorks above) and most overall functionality (including apps for all major desktop and mobile operating systems).

Note that whichever program you pick, I recommend steering away from large collections/base packages (e.g., [these](https://www.logos.com/compare-packages) in Logos, [these](https://www.accordancebible.com/Collections-Comparison) in Accordance). Under the pretense of getting a good deal, these marketing-heavy options in reality get you a few good resources and a whole lot of things that are mostly useless (such as expensive commentary collections). The better approach is to only buy those things that you will actually use; you should have a clear and defined reason for purchasing each and every resource you buy. Note that even if you buy the complete set of resources I personally use ([as detailed on the Resource Index page](/site/resource-index); not at all needed for the vast majority of all Christians who are not teachers), you will still come out money ahead relative to many of these large collections, and will have a much, much more useful reference library.

## Why I use Logos rather than alternatives

I own almost all of my Bible study resources in Logos. Here's the shortlist of reasons why this is so:

* Logos, along with Accordance, offers lots of advanced functionality. OliveTree is also excellent (and it probably has the cleanest interface of the three), but it trails the others in advanced functionality, in my experience. If you are a more casual user, any of the three generally work well in terms of functionality, but if you want more, you should go with either Logos or Accordance.
* Logos is the only one of the three to offer proper hyperlinking capability. I make heavy use of this in my own personal Bible notes/journal, and also in my published teaching on this site. Linking directly to resources in Logos removes essentially all barrier to referencing other texts -- even multi-volume Bible dictionaries, for example -- *which is absolutely huge*. Hyperlinks have always been one of the internet's strongest points, but citing rather than linking things (e.g., books) is a pain both for the person making the citation and the person following the citation. Direct links, by contrast, make citation unnecessary, and save everyone lots of time in the long run.
  * Linking to specific places in an electronic text is something that even Kindle books do not generally support. The hyperlinking ability of Logos is where I would like to see *all* digital texts heading in the future. Being able to directly link sections of formal academic and reference books (in addition to webpages) greatly increases convenience for both writers and readers of citation-heavy content.
* Logos is the only one of the three to offer a full webapp. As long as you have an internet connection, you can access your full Logos library from anywhere in the world, even on some computer that is not yours. This may not be useful all that often, but it is definitely useful.
* While all three Bible software programs run sales and promotional events, usually they are just 10%-off-your-order coupons and things of this sort. (I *highly* recommend waiting for a sitewide 20+% coupon before spending any substantial amount of money, no matter which program). Logos is the only one of the three to actually give monetary vouchers -- \$20 on your birthday every year, and occasionally other â€‹\$20 vouchers (e.g., for pastor appreciation month). This isn't earth-shattering, but if you stick with the software, this amounts to hundreds of dollars of free resources over the years.
* There are some resources in Accordance that you can only get as part of a package. While this may be true for some Logos resources too (?), I have never personally come across it, while I have come across multiple examples of things I would wish to buy individually in Accordance but cannot (e.g., [Smith's Bible Dictionary](https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=Smith%26%23039%3Bs+Dictionary)).
* Logos has the biggest overall library out of the three programs. This may not seem like all that big a deal because, as explained below, there are still some things that you can get in only one of the three programs anyway (so I have all three installed and regularly use all three), but it *is* important in terms of content synchronization. Let's say you were to own one Bible dictionary in Logos, and a different one in Accordance. If you were to own both of them in one program or the other you would be able to synchronize the resources, but you can't across programs. In general then, it is best to own all resources of a given type in the same program. The advantage Logos has is that since it has more resources, you won't ever have to split programs like this. Here's some examples of things only in Logos:
  * Logos has [Abbott-Smith's Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament](https://www.logos.com/product/31160/abbott-smiths-manual-greek-lexicon-of-the-new-testament), an excellent concise lexicon that helps illuminate the Hebrew behind many Greek words. It is convenient to be able to sync this with other Greek lexicons (Middle Liddell, BDAG, etc.)
  * Logos has [Zerwick's A Grammatical Analysis of the Greek New Testament](https://www.logos.com/product/4229/a-grammatical-analysis-of-the-greek-new-testament) and [its accompanying grammar](https://www.logos.com/product/7853/biblical-greek-illustrated-by-examples), a pair of resources that is enormously helpful for picking up speed in reading the New Testament (highly, highly recommended -- almost essential for intermediate students of Greek, in my opinion). It is convenient to be able to sync this with other technical Greek commentaries (e.g., [Meyer's Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament](https://www.logos.com/product/9847/critical-and-exegetical-commentary-on-the-new-testament)).
  * Logos has [Jastrow's Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature](https://www.logos.com/product/16534/dictionary-of-the-targumim-the-talmud-babli-and-yerushalmi-and-the-midrashic-literature), a reference lexicon for Talmudic studies. Standard Hebrew reference lexicons (BDB, TWOT, HALOT) don't fully cut it for the Talmud and other rabbinic writings, making Jastrow's an excellent supplement to have around. It is convenient to be able to sync this with the more conventional Hebrew lexicons.

One could go on. There aren't really all that many more examples of clear resource superiority in Logos since all three programs have most of the really important resources:

* All the main English Bibles, along with interlinears and reverse interlinears
* The standard Greek texts of the New Testament (UBS5, NA28)
* The standard Greek lexicons (Thayer's, Middle Liddell, BDAG, LSJ)
* The standard Hebrew texts of the Old Testament (BHS, BHQ)
* The standard Hebrew lexicons (BDB, TWOT, HALOT)
* The standard academic reference Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias (Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary, ISBE1995)
* Etc.

Logos does have a few other reference resources that the others don't (e.g., [Walker's A History of the Christian Church](https://www.logos.com/product/34030/a-history-of-the-christian-church), [Thiessen's Lectures in Systematic Theology](https://www.logos.com/product/7549/lectures-in-systematic-theology)), but since resources like these don't really sync with anything, it isn't so important what program you own them in as long as scripture references are tagged (contrast digital books not in Bible study programs, like Kindle books). Owning them in Logos does give you the benefits of hyperlinking and the webapp though, as above.

## Exceptions to the Logos-only approach

While it would be great if we could stick with one and only one Bible software program for everything, that is not presently possible, as some resources I find useful are available only in other programs. Thus, it is necessary to handle some resources in other programs rather than Logos, despite Logos' advantages.

[These are detailed on the Resource Index page](/site/resource-index/#what-about-resources-not-offered-in-logos).

### Study Bible(s) and Bible handbooks: OliveTree

Unfortunately, Neither Logos nor Accordance have my study Bible of choice (The [NIV Study Bible, edited by Kenneth Barker](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=59059)), or my Bible handbook of choice ([The New Unger's Bible Handbook](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17343)). OliveTree, however, has both. Adding [Halley's Bible Handbook](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=42724) rounds out the three general-background resources I recommend running in-line with scripture.

### Topical resources: OliveTree

The topical resources most people are familiar with (Nave's, Torrey's, etc.) act like dictionaries: you have to search for a term to pull it up. So if you are reading Joshua 1:1 and decide that you want to see verses about Joshua, you need to manually search the topical resources for "Joshua." Is this a big deal? No. Is it inconvenient? A bit.

It turns out that there exist topical resources that serve as more of a "two way street" between topics and verses: the dictionary portion links to verses, and the verses in turn link to the dictionary portion. Thus, if you scroll them in-line with a Bible, you can immediately jump to a verse list for a topic when coming upon said topic in your reading.

Some resources also support "chains" of verses, where you jump from one verse in the chain to the next sequentially to see how a theme develops over the course of a book (for example). These typically also allow you to jump straight to the main verse list for the topic in the dictionary portion of the resource, as above. All of these features add some additional value over the basic topical indices, so they can be good resources to acquire eventually. In terms of general resource options along these lines, there are two:

In terms of general resource options for [topical resources that can be scrolled in-line with scripture]() (which are far superior from a convenience perspective), there are two:

1. The Thompson Chain Reference Bible
1. The Dictionary of Bible Themes

Logos doesn't even offer the former, and Logos' implementation of the latter cannot be scrolled alongside scripture (despite having topical listings verse-by-verse). Accordance actually offers the former, but just like Logos, its implementation of the latter cannot be scrolled alongside scripture.

In OliveTree, both of the above resources can be scrolled alongside scripture, and the OliveTree folks also made their own threaded topical resource (that is obviously not available in the other two programs). Thus, for topical resources, I recommend people buy the [Thompson Chain Reference Bible](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17248), the [Dictionary of Bible Themes](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=21231), and the [Olive Tree Bible Topic Threads](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=40654) in OliveTree.

### Greek manuscript/papyri transcriptions for textual criticism: Accordance

Logos offers [a transcription of Sinaiticus](https://www.logos.com/product/35581/codex-sinaiticus), but that's it on the uncial side of things. (You can get the main papyri in Logos just fine via [Comfort and Barrett's The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts](https://www.logos.com/product/7855/the-text-of-the-earliest-new-testament-greek-manuscripts)).

Accordance [offers more MSS in addition to Sinaiticus and the papyri](https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=Codex+add-on), most noticeably Vaticanus, Alexandrinus, and Codex Bezae. Of [the great uncial codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_uncial_codices), Accordance only lacks [Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Ephraemi_Rescriptus).

Logos and OliveTree simply have no equivalent resources, so Accordance it is for these transcriptions. For the purposes of text comparisons, it makes sense to get the papyri too in Accordance rather than Logos (i.e., even though they are offered in both, it's best to get them in Accordance where the uncial transcriptions are, so that you can compare the papyri with the uncial transcriptions).

Other Greek textual criticism resources (apparatuses, Metzger's commentary) work fine in either program, but due to Logos' advantages, I still recommend getting them in Logos. It's only the transcriptions that I recommend Accordance for.

### Miscellaneous reference works that are not in Bible software programs: other sources

Despite my overwhelming preference for digital resources in Bible software programs, some of the resources I use simply are not available in any Bible software program, and many of these are not even digitized at all. This is partly because I tend to favor older resources that are more conservative in outlook and hold scripture in higher authority. (Newer releases from the age of computers basically all have digital versions, but it takes effort to digitize older works, particularly really old ones).

If I can find an ePub or Kindle version of a resource, that is second best (no verse tagging and cross-resource hyperlinks as in Bible software programs, but at least these have display that can be customized with respect to font and font-size, have text that can be copied and pasted, and so on). Then, in order of decreasing preference: high-quality scanned images and/or PDFs as might be found on [archive.org](http://archive.org/) (at least I can have these on my tablet rather than having to lug them around), modern (re)publications (typically have better bindings and clearer printing; I favor hardcover resources for durability), and then, finally, well-maintained used copies of out-of-print titles.

A list, in no particular order, of resources I own external to the Bible software programs:

* Unger's Commentary on the Old Testament; used out of print book, hardcover
* Unger's Commentary on the Gospels; modern print book, hardcover

### Do later: Greek and Hebrew audio by verse: Accordance

Hebrew audio only available in Accordance

https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=Hebrew%20Audio-OT

Greek audio is in both, so I recommend getting that one in Logos. Also cheaper, superior because it highlights text when it plays.

https://www.logos.com/product/26968/greek-audio-new-testament#Reviews
https://www.accordancebible.com/store/details/?pid=GNT%20Audio

But check on slowing audio down in accordance. Can;t do in Logos since matched with highlighting text? Know you can do it in Accordance, so stick with both in Accordance?
