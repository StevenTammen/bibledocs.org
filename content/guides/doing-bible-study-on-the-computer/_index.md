This collection of videos is focused on guides relating to doing Bible study on the computer, specifically with [the STEP Bible app](https://stepbible.org/) (for a free workflow) and [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/) (for a paid workflow).

If you are curious as to why we might want to do Bible study on the computer, then [see here](why-do-bible-study-on-the-computer). If you are curious as to why I use Logos (rather than [Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com/), say) as my paid Bible software app, then [see here](why-i-use-logos-bible-software).
