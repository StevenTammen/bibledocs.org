title: Why Do Bible Study on the Computer
writing-only: true
---

I *highly*, *highly* recommend doing all (or at least a good bit) of your Bible study on the computer. There are many reasons for this, even more than the non-exhaustive list of reasons below. The utility offered by well-crafted digital Bible study resources is positively enormous.

With this being said, this page is *NOT* taking the position that people should not have/use/enjoy non-electronic means. It is possible to enumerate the great benefits of the one without outright condemning the other.

## A brief list of reasons for doing Bible study on the computer

1. Verse references (including not only normal textual cross-references, but also those verse references showing up in study Bibles, Bible handbooks, and so on) can be instantly displayed on screen with hyperlinks. *Instantly*. No more paging through Bibles to look up verses ever again. Links can also exist between resources (so, e.g., a technical commentary can link to a reference lexicon and/or a grammar), letting you immediately jump to the material referenced rather than having to open up a separate paper book and paw through it. The ability to hyperlink saves an almost incalculable amount of time in the long term.
1. More than just hyperlinks between reference resources, digital Bibles are also completely crosslinked with lexicons: click on any word in the Biblical text to pull up the underlying Greek or Hebrew lexicon entry. Digital Bibles are also morphologically tagged (so you can hover over a Greek verb to immediately check the person, number, tense, mood, and voice, for example).
1. Digital original language concordances (showing all occurrences of a particular Greek or Hebrew lemma across the entire Bible) can be accessed instantly with a click or two.
1. Digital lexicons and digital original language concordances can be used even by people who can't read a lick of Greek or Hebrew -- they just click on an English word to pull up the Greek/Hebrew lexicon entry or concordance entry. Contrast these same sorts of resources in print, which absolutely require knowledge of the original languages due to the fact that words are organized/indexed alphabetically.
1. You can jump to anywhere in the Bible as easily as typing in the verse reference (extremely useful when jumping between reading sections in a daily Bible reading plan; many people, including myself, favor reading from several different sections of the Bible daily, rather than going cover to cover). You can jump straight to a Bible dictionary or encyclopedia article (on a person or a place, for example) by typing in the title of the article. You get the idea: navigating digital resources effectively takes no time... unlike paper resources.
1. Reference resources like Bible dictionaries can be kept in sync. So, for example, if you jump to an article on King Saul in one Bible dictionary, all the other dictionaries and encyclopedias will automatically jump to their own articles on Saul, making comparisons instantaneous. This is a biggie.
1. Having all your Bible study resources on the computer makes copy-pasting possible when making personal notes or annotations (like those you might otherwise make in the margins of paper Bibles), and also greatly enhances note-taking efficiency since typing (and especially voice-recognition, if you have a program like [Dragon by Nuance](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html) for it) is *way* faster than handwriting (in this latter case, ~200 WPM vs. ~20 WPM). I've found that switching to computer-based Bible study has vastly increased the number and usefulness of my own personal notes on scripture.
1. Having all your Bible study resources on the computer means you can have them with you absolutely everywhere. Try carrying around paper copies of eight different Bible versions, a concordance, multiple Bible dictionaries, etc., and you'll figure out pretty fast why it's great to have everything on your laptop or tablet!
1. Parallel Bible versions (e.g., the UBS5 Greek text and NASB English text) can be seamlessly kept in sync for easy parallel reading.
1. While syncing Bible versions is one thing, it is true more generally that you can at the same time have open as many Bible study resources as you want (much in the same way that users of paper resources may refer to several different works at once). I use a low-input-lag 4k TV as my computer monitor, and have at times had 8 resources open for reference at the same time, tiled across the screen so that I can easily refer to any of the 8 in an instant. Thus, far from making it harder to reference multiple things at once, having all your Bible study resources on the computer enhances the practice.
1. Interlinears and reverse interlinears can be shown and hidden with the click of a button.
1. Parallel texts (English Bible versions, but also Greek and Hebrew texts) can be displayed one on top of the other with differences visually highlighted. This makes textual comparisons and comparisons between different versions *way* faster.

All of these advantages (and even more like them not listed here) are huge, and cannot be had in print. The instant display of verse references is especially important. For all people who try to interpret scripture by means of more scripture (and that should be all of us), this feature saves an enormous amount of time.

## In my opinion, the primary downsides of digital resources can be effectively mitigated

### Distractions from social media, etc.

The largest downside that people report of doing Bible study on electronic devices -- that they get easily distracted (be it from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube, Netflix, Reddit, or whatever else) in a way that they can't with paper Bible study resources -- is *completely avoidable* if you use filtering software to block all internet access except for those sites and applications you use when doing Bible study. I use and recommend the "block everything but sites I explicitly allow" feature of [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) (only offered through their VIP Home plan) for doing this on computers, and I use an app on my Android phone called [Lock Me Out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teqtic.lockmeout&hl=en&gl=US) to accomplish the same.

### Reading on screens

Some people also claim that reading on screens has inherent disadvantages:

1. It keeps them up at night and disrupts their sleep.
2. It tires their eyes out more than paper resources.
3. They don't learn as well as when they read paper resources.

#### Claim: It keeps them up at night and disrupts their sleep

As to the first claim, there is some evidence that the blue light emitted from LED screens can affect circadian rhythms (via melatonin suppression). You can block (or at least limit) blue light with an app called [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) (there are other equivalent applications as well). Reducing screen brightness later at night is also generally a good idea, and eliminates most of the practical differences between reading on paper and reading on screen. That is, since our eyes don't care where the photons hitting them ultimately come from (as in reflected off paper vs. emitted from an LED screen), if you reduce screen brightness at night such that the total amount of light hitting your eyes is less than or equal to the amount of light that would hit them if it were reflected off a page of a paper book, then how would brightness considerations make reading on LED screens inferior with regards to sleep? There is simply no mechanism under these circumstances for one to be noticeably better or worse than the other.

#### Claim: It tires their eyes out more than paper resources

As to the second claim, there is also some evidence that reading on a bright screen in a completely dark room (i.e., not matching screen brightness to room brightness -- creating a sharp contrast gradient) can create higher levels of eyestrain than paper resources that simply reflect ambient light (and are thus always somewhat contrast-neutral). You can avoid this problem by always using your computer in good light (the same sort of circumstance you would read a paper book in). Taking a break every half hour or so to get and up and get a drink (e.g.) to rest your eyes -- a good habit to get into regardless -- also effectively mitigates all problems in this area.

#### Claim: They don't learn as well as when they read paper resources

As to the third claim, to date, there has been no methodologically-rigorous peer-reviewed study that I am aware of that has conclusively shown that this statement is true *when comparing apples to apples*. Many people are accustomed to "skimming" webpages (definitely not helpful in terms of content retention) -- but this is in no way inherent to reading on screens. (So, for example, you can just choose not to do it when seriously studying).

Further, while it true that scrolling causes more cognitive load than flipping a page, almost all Bible study applications allow you to read text page by page anyhow (exactly like paper), and it is possible to do effectively the same on webpages using PageUp and PageDn along with a browser extension that helps you keep track of the bottom of the page. I use a Chrome extension called [Scroll Marker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scroll-marker/jdoinodpdahlmpgmpmhonheidpjhhnid) for this purpose. In fact, having the ability to *either* scroll when skimming text (looking at headings, for example -- extremely useful in quickly getting an overview of a page or looking for something specific) *or* read in-depth screen-by-screen (like this extension allows) literally allows you to have the best of both worlds, with no downsides. (The reason why I recommend a browser extension for this rather than coding it into this website myself is because if you use an extension, you can use it across *all* websites).

In short there is no mechanism that has been explained as to how paper books are magically better than reading on screens. If you take pains to read on screens the same way you read physical books (not skimming, paging rather than scrolling most of the time), there is essentially no difference between the mediums in this specific regard.

## Sharing digital resources is possible

An important point to make is that Bible software accounts can typically be shared among members of an immediate family (like a spouse) if you meet the terms of use, which usually boil down to something like "we are not lawyers, but if usage is in line with that of a single person, corresponding roughly to only one instance of the software being used at a time, you are probably OK."

The official legalese typically reads something like: "[Company] grants to you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use one copy of the Product on up to some (or perhaps any) number of supported devices that you own or control."

Compare: [Logos](https://community.logos.com/forums/p/341/3265.aspx#3265) (this is a forum post from the CEO), [Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com/Legal#single), [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/press/privacy.php#eula). The general sentiment seems to be that if both you and your spouse are heavy users who teach and do a lot of research, you should probably duplicate resources across two separate accounts to be ethical, since you function more like two users. On the other hand, if one person is a heavy user and the other person only occasionally uses the software -- and the software is only used on the shared family computer, e.g. -- you are not really being unethical by being on one account.

## Conclusion: digital resources are incredibly useful

A lot of folks have been reading their paper Bibles and using paper concordances (e.g.) for decades. Transitioning to doing things on the computer may feel a bit unfamiliar and uncomfortable. Despite the discomfort, it is my recommendation both as an individual and as a Bible teacher that people give it a real, fair chance -- the benefits of doing Bible study on the computer really are that huge. Some older folks who have difficulties with computers may be a special exception, but as a general rule, it is my belief that most people will benefit enormously from the digital tools for Bible study that we now have available to us.

People should, of course, still make their own decisions in areas of application like this.
