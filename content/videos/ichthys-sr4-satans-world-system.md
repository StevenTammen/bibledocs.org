   A video series going through SR4 on Ichthys, a study covering the structure and organization of Satan's world system. Satan is the present ruler of this world (only because God lets him, for this short time), and tries by all means to deceive us and distract us from the truth. By formally studying his strategies and tactics, we can learn to see through his illusions, and come to appreciate the spiritual realities that are actually at work in the world.

## Overview

There is [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vKx7rnNMglihjHCiAniayAuvZ5ScZ3zLJ4p3HM_dTNE/edit?usp=sharing) for posting questions you have about things covered in the video lessons. If you post the questions for a given lesson early enough in the week (before Friday morning, say), I'll probably be able to come prepared to answer them when we record the Q&A video for that lesson.
