   What Bible versions and translations does this site make use of, and why? For the most part, all modern translations are quite trustworthy, but I especially like those that focus on readability and understandability in English (even if they aren't so flashy): the 1984 NIV, the ESV (for adults); the NIrV (for children, non-native English speakers, etc.). The NASB is good to use in parallel with Greek and Hebrew texts, since its literalness makes it easier to see how the original languages map onto it. Occasionally, when it seems to me like conventional translations have missed the mark (or if I just want to emphasize and/or clarify some points) I will translate from the original languages myself. These original translations are clearly marked out and labeled.

## Translation sources

### My own original translations

Some of the translations used on this site are my own. These translations come directly from the original Greek and Hebrew. They will always be marked out as being original translations, like so:

{{% original-translation p="Genesis 1:1" %}}

In beginning [His actions regarding the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth (i.e., created the material universe itself — which was not previously existent).

{{% /original-translation %}}

As a rule of thumb, I don't use my own translations unless doing so is actually necessary. (Conventional versions miss the mark in some way). Most of the time I'll just quote from a well-respected English translation (NIV84, ESV, etc.) that gets the sense of the passage right.

I will, however, use my own translations when I wish to expand upon what is written in the passage by adding inferred words and phrases (compare the italicized words in the KJV) or explanatory remarks (compare the use of the parenthetical statement beginning with i.e. in the translation of Genesis 1:1 above).

A full explanation of the syntax used in my own translations can be found [on the FAQ's page](/site/frequently-asked-questions/#what-syntax-do-you-use-in-translations-original-to-this-site). You can see a complete list of the original translations that can be found on this site in the [translation index](/site/translation-index).

### Translations from Ichthys

[As described on the links page](/site/links/#ichthys), the ministry I grew up under was [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/), another online teaching ministry. Ichthys follows a very similar policy as this website in terms of original translations (that is, quoting from conventional versions that get the sense of a passage right most of the time, but occasionally translating directly to better elucidate or expand on the meaning), and maintains a [translation index](https://ichthys.com/translist.htm) of its original translations, [just like this site](/site/translation-index).

Rather than creating an original translation of my own when conventional versions miss the mark, I may occasionally use one of Ichthys' original translations. This is largely to save time (translating is generally very time-intensive), and also because the author of Ichthys (Dr. Robert Luginbill, [a Classics professor at the University of Louisville](https://louisville.edu/languages/about-us/faculty-profiles/robert-d-luginbill)) has much more overall expertise in the languages than myself. For one thing, he teaches Greek at the University level, so just has much more daily exposure to it than my nonexistent exposure to it in my day job as a software engineer.

A full explanation of the syntax used in these Ichthys translations can be found in [Ichthys FAQ #20](https://ichthys.com/FAQs-Ichthys.htm#20.__). It is actually essentially the same as [the syntax that I use in my own translations](/site/frequently-asked-questions/#what-syntax-do-you-use-in-translations-original-to-this-site), although I was the one to copy, not the other way round).

### Higher-level writing: NIV84, ESV

*Note: the site's two writing levels are described [here](/site/writing-level/#higher-and-lower-writing-levels-on-this-site).*

On this site you may come across the version abbreviations "NIV11" and "NIV84." These are two different versions of the New International Version.

The 1984 NIV is probably the English Bible version that I personally read from the most. Unfortunately, after the publication of the 2011 NIV, the copyright holder in North America decided to try and "stamp out" the old translation: not only did they stop offering print Bibles in the 1984 version, but they also removed it from Bible study websites and the stores of Bible software applications. While the new translation isn't universally terrible (i.e., it's not a "translation of the devil" or any other hogwash like that), the older NIV translation is better in multiple places, and also doesn't suffer from the verbal gymnastics and interpretive problems that arise from trying to remove gender from language.

Astute readers may have noticed the "North America" qualification on the censorship of the 1984 NIV. As best I understand, Hodder and Staughton hold the UK rights to the NIV, and as of yet, they haven't yanked it from Bible study platforms, unlike their North American counterparts.

The upshot of this is that if you don't mind wading through some peculiarities of British English (for example, "colour" and "armour" rather than "color" and "armor"; the odd lexical use of "corn" to mean "grains in general" rather than [Maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize) -- compare Britain's so-called [Corn Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#:~:text=The%20word%20'corn'%20in%20British,producers%2C%20and%20represented%20British%20mercantilism) -- and so on), you can actually still purchase the 1984 NIV in English. For example, [here's a link](https://www.logos.com/product/29979/the-holy-bible-new-international-version-anglicised) to buy the "Anglicized" 1984 NIV in [Logos](https://www.logos.com/). (Unfortunately, however, this Anglicized version doesn't have interlinear support).

Even though you can buy an Anglicized version of the 1984 NIV like this, I still quote from the "normal" (i.e., Americanized) 1984 NIV on this site since I do happen to own it. Thus, any time you see the abbreviation NIV84 on this site, that is the no-longer-available Americanized version of the 1984 NIV. (The Anglicized version of the 1984 NIV is instead abbreviated NIV84A).

Since you can't find the full Americanized 1984 NIV anywhere on the internet (at least not legally), any quotations of the 1984 NIV on this site have the net effect of giving site readers another comparison version to work with (one that is not otherwise available).

What the NIV does fairly well is balance faithfulness to the original text with readability. To reduce many complex and involved arguments to a sentence or two, while it is true that straying too far from what we have in the original languages is dangerous, English is not Greek (or Hebrew), and translations need to focus on making readable *English*. To put things a bit more generally, we want our translations to clearly present the meaning of the Biblical text in the target language -- that is what is important, the meaning.

The 1984 NIV is not the only version to get this idea right, but I find that it does often strike a better balance than most other translations. The NLT can be very good if the translators get the sense of the passage right, but since it is more "interpretive" as a translation, it can also be very wrong if not (making it much like [the little girl in the Longfellow poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44650/there-was-a-little-girl)). This inconsistency makes me wary of recommending it too strongly. (To be fair, the NIV suffers from this same unevenness, but just to a somewhat lesser degree).

Two other versions I find strike a decent balance are the ESV and NKJV. The NKJV is quite a bit more on the literal side, and has a less-approachable high literary style, but it does have a certain eloquence going for it (inherited from its ancestor, the KJV). The ESV, while somewhat more bland, is probably easier reading overall. Bland isn't bad either -- I'll take bland and accurate over flashy and wrong any day.

If I were forced to rank translations for general reading and reference, it would probably go NIV84 > ESV > NKJV > NIV11/NLT > NASB. Literal translations done well (e.g., the NASB) are good to use in interlinears proper and when viewing English and Greek/Hebrew in parallel, as they more clearly map onto the original languages; they can be excellent for so-called "close study" of the text. The rest of the time though... probably best to stick with more readable English versions. The general issue is put well by Spurgeon, who, when speaking of the English Revised Version (the British counterpart of the ASV, of which the NASB is more or less an update), deemed it “Strong in Greek, but weak in English.”

As a closing thought, limiting oneself to just one or two versions is a bad idea, since even the best translations miss the mark in some places; instead, it is best to check a wide variety of respectable versions whenever a passage seems "off" or "fishy." With this being said, based on the general reasons outlined above, this site does *typically* preferentially quote from the ESV (STEP Bible app embedded windows) and NIV84 (plain text quotations) in higher-level writing. ([See below](#ways-in-which-scripture-passages-show-up) on the difference between embedded windows and plain text quotations).

While I prefer a more readable version for accessing scripture most of the time, I do preferentially turn to the NASB as a comparison version: its different (more literal) translation approach makes it an excellent foil for the NIV84 and ESV. This reason right here is why the default verse tagging version used on this site is NASB: since most scripture quoted on this site will show up as either NIV84 or ESV, having Reftagger use NASB lets site readers natively and efficiently access two different Bible versions for passages, two versions well-suited to be compared and contrasted against each other.

### Lower-level writing: NIrV

*Note: the site's two writing levels are described [here](/site/writing-level/#higher-and-lower-writing-levels-on-this-site).*

The NIrV (New International Reader's Version) is a translation based on the text of the NIV, but written at a third grade reading level (or somewhere around there). This means it uses shorter words and simpler sentences, making it a good choice for children, non-native English speakers, and other groups like these.

The people that benefit from the NIrV translation are typically the same people that benefit from the lower-level writing on this site. For this reason, unless the NIrV really gets a passage wrong, I will quote almost exclusively from it in the lower-level writing on this site.

## Ways in which scripture passages show up

### STEP Bible app embedded windows

[On the Links page](/site/links/#bible-reading-app) I recommend Tyndale House's [STEP Bible app](https://www.stepbible.org/) -- a free online Bible software application that provides a lot of functionality useful in doing Bible study. For example:

- Viewing parallel versions and translations.
- Instantly viewing passage cross-references.
- Instantly viewing related verses by topic (an in-line version of [Nave's Topical Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave%27s_Topical_Bible)).
- Checking lexical information for the Greek and Hebrew words behind English words (compare lexicons keyed to Strong's numbers).
- Checking word usage using an original-language concordance (compare Strong's concordance, again using Strong's numbers).

It so happens that the team behind the STEP Bible app provides an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) for embedding the application in webpages. Embedding the application directly on pages lets site readers make use of all the STEP Bible app's functionality (as above) without having to navigate away to another web address and/or juggle a bunch of tabs. In short, embedding the Bible software application directly on pages increases convenience and time-efficiency in making use of the app's functionality. (Adding the app directly to pages does cause this website's pages to be bigger, and thus consume more network data. Even so, I think the tradeoffs are well worth it).

Unfortunately, the STEP Bible app does not offer the 1984 NIV or the NIrV. (It also lacks the NKJV and NLT). For this reason, most all the STEP Bible passages on this site end up using the ESV -- whether in higher-level writing or lower-level writing. In-line with the reasoning mentioned above, however, the NASB is used when the original languages are being shown in parallel with English.

I have added my own custom interface to the embedded windows to let site readers resize the height of the embedded windows according to their preferences. I will typically try to pick a good default height based on the total amount of content in a given embedded window, but most of the time it is useful to make the embedded windows as tall as possible (the 800px height option) when doing anything more complicated with the app.

[![Select the 800px option](height-selector.png)](height-selector.png)

### Plain text quotes

While I am a big fan of all the functionality the STEP Bible app allows for (I especially like always having cross-references, an original language concordance, and Greek and Hebrew lexicons at my fingertips), it is true that the embedded windows inevitably add a good bit of complexity. Some people may just want to see quotations of scripture as plain text without all the interface sparkle and potentially confusing functionality -- and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this.

For this reason, it is possible to "turn off" the embedded STEP Bible app windows on any given page by using the toggle link under the page section in the menu sidebar:

[![Embedded window toggle in menu](embedded-window-toggle.png)](embedded-window-toggle.png)

You can also turn off the embedded windows globally (so that they will be off by default whenever you are visiting new pages -- although you can toggle them back on on a per-page basis using the same sidebar link as above) [on the settings page](/settings/#step-bible-app-embedded-windows):

[![Embedded window global setting on settings page](embedded-window-global-setting.png)](embedded-window-global-setting.png)

#### Plain text quotes and small screens

While I give readers the option to choose most of the time, once screen widths are narrow enough, only the plain text quotations are displayed. This is to maximize usage of precious screen real-estate: the interface for the embedded windows wastes a degree of screen space, which is disadvantageous when there is not much screen space to begin with. It is also much more difficult to make use of the STEP Bible app's functionality in small embedded windows (compare my above recommendation to use the tallest 800px height option when doing anything more complicated). These reasons together (increased marginal cost with simultaneous reduced marginal benefit) are why the embedded windows are phased out in favor of plain text quotations on small screens.

#### Plain text quotes and added emphasis

Plain text quotes are also used any time I am adding emphasis to the Biblical text (making words bold and italic, e.g.), since there is no way for me to add any emphasis to the text in the embedded STEP Bible app windows.
