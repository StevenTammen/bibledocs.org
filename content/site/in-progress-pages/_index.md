   So that this site can offer as much Bible teaching as possible at any given point in time, I make a practice of posting pages on the site before I have completed writing absolutely everything I expect to be on them long-term. In other words, the writing that is posted as in progress is basically as it will be in the final version (that is, already essentially polished and edited), but not all of it is there as of yet.

Some pages have a warning at the top discussing the fact that they are presently in progress. Here's what that warning looks like:

{{< partial "in-progress" >}}

The main idea is to make as much content available as soon as possible (to maximize the amount of Bible teaching that readers can access on this site), while still taking care to not publish any content that is still "half-baked", since "half-baked" and "Bible teaching" should never go together.

I do try to strike a balance in what is posted on the site so that it's not just a forest of page stubs and outlines. What this means in practice is that while I typically have many, many things I am working on concurrently, I only publicly post the ones that I am planning to work on consistently such that they actually get finished in a timely manner.
