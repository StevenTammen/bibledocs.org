#### What does a page being "in progress" mean?

Some pages have a warning at the top discussing the fact that they are presently in progress. Here's what that warning looks like:

{{< partial "in-progress" >}}

The main idea is to make as much content available as soon as possible (to maximize the amount of Bible teaching that readers can access on this site), while still taking care to not publish any content that is still "half-baked", since "half-baked" and "Bible teaching" should never go together.
