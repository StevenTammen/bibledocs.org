Some pages have a warning at the top discussing the fact that they are presently in progress. Here's what that warning looks like:

{{< partial "in-progress" >}}

The main idea is to make as much content available as soon as possible (to maximize the amount of Bible teaching that readers can access on this site), while still taking care to not publish any content that is still "half-baked", since "half-baked" and "Bible teaching" should never go together.

I do try to strike a balance in what is posted on the site so that it's not just a forest of page stubs and outlines. What this means in practice is that while I typically have many, many things I am working on concurrently, I only publicly post the ones that I am planning to work on consistently such that they actually get finished in a timely manner.
