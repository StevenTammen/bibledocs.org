The BibleDocs mailing list is one of the primary channels by which site readers can stay abreast of what is going on with this ministry (see also the [RSS feeds](/site/rss)).

Here is a brief description of the list's mailing frequency and the sort of things that show up in the list's messages:

- While I may occasionally send more or less emails (i.e., the frequency isn't strictly fixed), you can expect on the order of two emails a month from me. I won't spam you.
- Messages typically involve news about the ministry (including, but certainly not limited to, descriptions of new content available on the site).
- Messages may occasionally contain anonymized prayer requests that I view as particularly important to pass on. For example, "Please pray for Mark's father's battle with cancer."
- I may also occasionally highlight material from other ministries that I find worthy of sharing. I am blessed to be in contact with a group of fellow teachers laboring in the truth, and will sometimes signal boost for them.
