TODO: write bit about mailing list, move paragraph from home page to here?

. Here is a brief description of the list's mailing frequency and the sort of things that show up in the list's messages:</p>
						
						<p><ul style="text-align:left;">
							<li>While I may occasionally send more or less emails (i.e., the frequency isn't strictly fixed), you can expect on the order of two emails a month from me. I won't spam you.</li>
							<li>Messages typically involve news about the ministry (including, but certainly not limited to, descriptions of new content available on the site).</li>
							<li>Messages may occasionally contain anonymized prayer requests that I view as particularly important to pass on. For example, "Please pray for Mark's father's battle with cancer."</li>
							<li>I may also occasionally highlight material from other ministries that I find worthy of sharing. I am blessed to be in contact with a group of fellow teachers laboring in the truth, and will sometimes signal boost for them.</li>
						</ul></p>
