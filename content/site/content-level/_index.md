### Content level

Content on this site is labeled as to its overall spiritual difficulty level, as it seems to me. This sort of labeling is subjective and hand-wavy, it is true, but hopefully it can be at least somewhat useful as a guide. The labeling looks like so:

<ul>
<li><span class="basic">basic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="basic">basic+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="intermediate">intermediate</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="intermediate">intermediate+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="advanced">advanced</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="advanced">advanced+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="mixed">mixed</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#content-level">Some link to content</a></li>
</ul>

The distinction between the bare labels and the "plus versions" (e.g., <span class="basic">basic</span> and <span class="basic">basic+</span>) is the "ease of acceptability / controversy factor" -- things with plus labels are more controversial and/or harder to accept, as it seems to me. It so happens that many of the things that are controversial and/or harder to accept are more advanced teachings, as one might expect. Christians disagree about the basic parameters of the gospel very little, but particulars of eschatological chronology quite a bit, for example.

While this site's writings do run the full spectrum, the two content levels this site focuses on the most are <span class="basic">basic</span> and <span class="advanced">advanced+</span>, as described above in [the section about content focus](#content-focus).

#### Why only three levels of content?

The main reason why I only define and use three content levels is because the lines are so blurry and indistinct. I would be quite uncomfortable breaking things down any more, since fine-grained categorizations would really imply a level of precision that simply isn't there.

Part of this is because different people find different things hard (i.e., my <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span> might be your <span class="basic">basic</span>), so any labels I affix are really my best guesses as to how "most Christians" will relate to the content. The same goes for my decisions about what content I give the plus distinction and what content I do not.

#### What content level(s) should I focus on?

This is a question that is difficult to answer. New believers really should focus on the basics of the gospel and what it means to be Christian (for example), but after that the best order to approach things really becomes something of a personal matter.

More than anything else, figuring out "where you are" is probably best done with some personal experimentation. As a general principle, however, I can recommend following your interests (even if this means you jump up a level above where you have been), since interest is a crucial component of effective learning.

### How the levels interact with the site's content types

Here is a brief overview of how the levels interact with all of this site's primary content types:

|                             | Content Level                    | Writing Level |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Topical Studies             | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Pages                       | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Q&As: Self-Generated        | Any of the levels                | Both          |
| Q&As: Reader Correspondence | Typically mixed                  | Higher        |
| Q&As: Mentor Correspondence | Typically advanced or advanced+  | Higher        |
| Ministry Info               | Typically intermediate           | Both          |
| Guides                      | N/A                              | Lower         |
| Study Group Recordings      | Typically mixed                  | Higher        |
| Greek Resources             | N/A                              | Higher        |
| Hebrew Resources            | N/A                              | Higher        |

Some general notes about the table:

* Pages from the content types in the table above that have a content level of “Any of the levels” can be of any of the content levels, from <span class="basic">basic</span> all the way through <span class="advanced">advanced+</span>.
* Pages from the content types in the table above that have a writing level of “Both” (Topical Studies, Pages, Q&As: Self-Generated, Ministry Info) are offered with both a higher level version of the page and a lower level version of the page (only one of which will show up on the content type's list page according to [which writing level is selected on the settings page](/settings/#writing-level)). Pages from the content types that are only offered at one writing level (Q&As: Reader Correspondence, Q&As: Mentor Correspondence, Guides, Study Group Recordings, Greek Resources, Hebrew Resources) will always show up on list pages, regardless of which writing level is selected. (To put all this differently, the writing level site setting only affects content types that have a writing level of "Both").

Some notes specific to various content types:

* While writings in the categories of Topical Studies and Pages can occasionally end up with a content level of <span class="mixed">mixed</span>, this is not particularly common.
* The three subtypes of Q&As all behave a bit differently. Q&As that are completely generated by me behave in essentially the same way as Pages. The other two Q&A types that involve actual written exchanges (between site readers and myself, between myself and my mentors) are only offered at a higher writing level to avoid "rewriting history" ([see below](#this-content-is-not-ever-rewritten-at-a-lower-writing-level)). While my correspondence with site readers is often variable in overall spiritual level (why it often ends up labeled as <span class="mixed">mixed</span>), the correspondence I have with my mentors is most commonly about complicated things (why it often ends up labeled as <span class="advanced">advanced</span> or <span class="advanced">advanced+</span>).
* Most writings in the category of Ministry Info have a content level of <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span>. Working out the specifics of ministries in general and one's own ministry in particular is not really something for new believers, but it is also not "hard teaching" as far as things go. It's more a question of "of what type am I?" than "how exactly do these things work again?"
* Study Group Recordings typically end up with a content level of <span class="mixed">mixed</span> since the discussion within our Bible study tends to range widely in its level (although I would say it most frequently hovers between <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span> and <span class="advanced">advanced</span>).
* Since Guides are intended to be straightforward and easy to follow, they are only offered in a lower writing level (and there is only one video, rather than two split by presentation level). The reverse is true for Study Group Recordings, Greek Resources and Hebrew Resources: all of these are only offered at a higher writing level (and video level), since the people making use of these resources, as a general rule, will have no use for a lower writing level. In all four cases, not having to maintain two versions of the content ends up saving me a lot of time.
* Writings in the categories of Guides, Greek resources, and Hebrew resources have no content level, as these things are typically not spiritual in nature, *per se*. The guides on this site are primarily focused on practical matters of "how to do X," and the language resources would be at home on any secular University's language department portal (although textual examples are overwhelmingly drawn from the Bible). Links for these content types will therefore not be prefixed with a content level, as they don't have one.

<!--
* Verse-by-verse Studies and Study Notes are organized chapter-by-chapter on this site, and the content levels here will thus be guided by how "hard" chapters are, as it seems to me. So, for example, James 2 is given a higher content level than narrative chapters within the gospels. The content level for any given chapter of the Bible will be the same across the Verse-by-verse Studies and the Study Notes.
