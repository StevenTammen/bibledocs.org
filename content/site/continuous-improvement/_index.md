## Continuous improvement

I view this site as a perpetual "work in progress" rather than a collection of static documents in an immutable framework. This constant refinement over time is, in my opinion, essential to long-term quality. Changes to individual pages can be tracked by viewing the commit history of their markdown source in the site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/bibledocs.org/). Using this commit history, for any given page, you'll be able to get a pretty good idea of what's happened in recent changes to the page.
