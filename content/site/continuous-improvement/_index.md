summary: >-
   Throughout much of history, writing was distributed via static publishing of books. Far from being a problem at the time, the invention of the printing press democratized literacy, and, among other things, made the Bible available in everyday spoken languages like German and English (rather than High Church Latin). Nowadays, however, we are at another inflection point. Continuous deployment of writing on the internet allows for global, instantaneous updating of published content, so that it is always kept completely up-to-date. This page describes this site's content in terms of this concept.

## Formalization of the concept in terms of Bible teaching

I view the teaching on this site as a perpetual "work in progress" rather than a collection of static documents in an immutable framework. This constant refinement over time is, in my opinion, essential to long-term quality. Changes to individual pages can be tracked by viewing the commit history of their [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) source in the site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenTammen/bibledocs.org/). Using this commit history, for any given page, you'll be able to get a pretty good idea of what's happened in terms of changes to the page over time.

### The circling bird of prey analogy

While it would be great if Bible teachers got everything perfect the very first time, the truth of the matter is that spiritual growth is a constant process that never ends (even for us as teachers). As a visual analogy, this is rather similar to how a bird of prey might circle in closer and closer to their target: we as Christians progressively circle in closer to the truth over time.

This side of heaven, we will never truly understand things fully. Yet as we continually improve over time, the gap between where we are and where we were can in fact yawn quite wide.

### The point is that improvement never stops

No matter how finely I go through my writing before publishing it or how many times I've already been through it, I find that every time I open a page, I end up changing at least something. Frequently it's just improving phrasing, adding more support for a point, or reworking an awkward sentence. Sometimes it's more substantial content reorganization. Very rarely it's me actually changing the teaching -- walking back something mistaken that I put forward as true, something that I now believe not to be so.

If I sat around worrying about total perfection, I would never end up publishing anything at all on this site. This is not to say that I am cavalier in the approach that I take to publishing things, but simply that I take pains to embrace rather than avoid the fact that the content I publish today will be inferior to its state several years from now, and in truth will never truly be completely perfect. Only by accepting this principle and being ready and willing to admit that things can always be made better will the truth be given its due respect.

The most dangerous state of mind to adopt is that you have arrived, that your content is perfect or close enough to such for you to kick back and be proud. Why? Because good enough never is.

**The concept of continuous improvement can also be applied to ministry more generally**

I studied industrial engineering for a time when I was at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I was particularly fascinated by the concept of process efficiency: [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing), [Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma), and so on. After ending up in computer science, [Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) stole my focus.

An interesting side-effect of learning formally about process efficiency is that you start applying the principles you learn in a professional context to absolutely everything. (Most engineers of any stripe can probably relate). Thinking about things like value streams, metrics, management controls, task prioritization, process interdependency, schedule hazards, and so forth becomes second-nature, and you can't help but look at everything around you with ideas for improvement gleaming in your eyes.

This is no different in terms of ministry. While it is true that much in this area will vary by individual (as in 1 Corinthians 12:4-6), it is also true that there are certain global absolutes. Several examples:

* **Prioritization of teaching**

  * Teachers need to prioritize the things that their individual flocks need to hear. Furthermore, since some teaching builds upon other teaching, it is beneficial for teachers to map out their teaching plan to ensure that prerequisite topics have already been covered by the time dependent teaching comes around.

* **Flock metrics and the teaching feedback loop**

  * Teachers need to be in a constant feedback loop as to how well their flocks are understanding their teaching, and how what they are saying is being received. Adjustments to topic, tone (forcefulness of presentation), length, complexity, and so forth should be made as necessary.

* **Mapping spiritual tasks to minimal-waste paths**

  * Within the wider Body of Christ, there is a definite division of labor (again, compare 1 Corinthians 12). Evangelists aren't as good at teaching as pastor-teachers, for example.
  * Over time, net spiritual benefit will be maximized if everyone works according to their function and purpose... but this doesn't just happen! Self-reflection is required to evaluate spiritual strengths and weaknesses, and finding other people in the Body who can complement your skills and shore up your weaknesses is an active rather than a passive process.
