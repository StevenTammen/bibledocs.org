## Topical studies

The Topical Studies on this site are longform series covering various topics in depth, in the manner of reference books. Their primary purpose is to flesh out areas of particular importance in a systematic way. Some of the Topical Studies are focused more on doctrine and theology, and some are focused more on application and implementation, but of course the lines are always somewhat blurry.

In many cases, topical studies are an aggregation of shorter pages from the [pages section](/pages), along with additional content to glue things together. One might ask — why include the actual content of these pages rather than just including links to the pages? The main answer is because it makes uninterrupted reading possible, without having to constantly be juggling tabs and keeping track of where you are in multiple documents. It also makes these studies more useful when they are printed out, which some folks like to do. Links don’t work on paper!

## Pages

The Pages section contains brief but thorough treatments of individual concepts, and of all sections on the site, contains the most content. The written content of pages will be updated with improvements and corrections over time (like most all writing on this site), making these living documents.

Groups of pages may be collected and glued together with some additional content to form [topical studies](/topical-studies).

## Verse-by-verse studies

The Verse-by-verse Studies on this site provide detailed interpretation, in the manner of an opinionated technical commentary. Their primary purpose is to establish the meaning of the text with a rigorous, step-by-step approach that leaves nothing out, sacrificing a degree of brevity for depth.

### The difference between verse-by-verse studies and study notes

So what is the difference between the Verse-by-verse Studies and Study Notes on this site? The short version is that the Verse-by-verse Studies justify the interpretations presented, while the Study Notes simply assert them. The Verse-by-verse Studies also contain certain things the Study Notes do not: additional in-line resource links (to Greek/Hebrew texts and technical commentaries), helpful notes for intermediate students of Greek/Hebrew (notes not so much focused on establishing meaning as saving time for such students), and an embedded original translation of the text (currently more for the Greek New Testament than the Hebrew Old Testament; my Greek is stronger than my Hebrew).

## Study notes

The Study Notes on this site are notes on the text of the Bible, in the manner of a study Bible. Their primary purpose is to briefly describe the meaning of the text in a no-frills sort of way.

## Questions and answers

The Q&As on this site are dedicated to shorter treatments of various topics, organized in a question and answer format. Some of these Q&As come from correspondence with site readers, some are from my own correspondence with my teachers and mentors (I'm the one asking questions in these), and finally others (both questions and answers) are completely of my own creation.

The "answers" contained herein are not necessarily to be taken as holy and unquestionable writ (after all, they are coming from imperfect human beings), but simply as responses to the questions.

## Ministry info

The ministry info section on this site is dedicated to providing information relevant to various ministries (such as apologetics, evangelism, music, etc.), in the manner of job handbooks.

## Guides

This section contains pages with embedded video guides on various topics, like using Bible study software. Video makes more sense than text as a medium for guides, but there are still various benefits to having the videos live on pages on my website rather than only showing up on YouTube ([see below](/about-the-site/#why-pages-for-video-guides)).

I highly recommend that if you wish to link to any of my guides, you link to the guide pages on my website rather than directly to the YouTube videos. You can read more about why I recommend such in the above link.

## Study group recordings

I have long run an online Bible study group. This section contains descriptions of the studies we have done over time, with links to the corresponding YouTube playlists. We do not move particularly fast, but we also try to avoid seriously-off-topic rabbit trails.

Please note that these videos are posted "as is" and are not corrected or improved over time. For this reason, you should err on the side of trusting the written content on this site more than anything that shows up in the videos. (For a more thorough discussion, [see below](/about-the-site/#caveats-with-recordings-of-study-groups)). I am simply offering the video recordings because it costs me very little effort to do so, and some people may find them helpful, even if they are not always perfect.

If you are interested in participating in the Bible study, [see here](/online-bible-studies/).

## Greek resources

This section contains pages pertaining to the study of Ancient Greek, particularly the Greek of the New Testament and its time.

Some pages may link to videos from a Greek study group that I run (if discussion in the video is relevant to the page), and some of these videos, in turn, may link to pages on the site. In general, I would recommend focusing on the written content on the pages, as it will always be kept up to date, whereas the videos will not ever receive changes or corrections over time. (For a more thorough discussion, [see below](/about-the-site/#caveats-with-recordings-of-study-groups)). I am simply offering the video recordings because it costs me very little effort to do so, and some people may find them helpful, even if they are not always perfect.

## Hebrew resources

This section contains pages pertaining to the study of Biblical Hebrew.

Some pages may link to videos from a Hebrew study group that I run (if discussion in the video is relevant to the page), and some of these videos, in turn, may link to pages on the site. In general, I would recommend focusing on the written content on the pages, as it will always be kept up to date, whereas the videos will not ever receive changes or corrections over time. (For a more thorough discussion, [see below](/about-the-site/#caveats-with-recordings-of-study-groups)).
