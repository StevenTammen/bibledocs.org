   I try to keep this site focused on actual Bible teaching and high-level discussion of application. However, I write about a lot of other things that people might find useful on my personal website (StevenTammen.com): Productivity and Efficiency, Gear, Software, Exercise, Nutrition, Health, Finances, and more.

I run another website, my personal website, [StevenTammen.com](https://www.steventammen.com). While this other website is primarily composed of things that do not have much overtly spiritual content, its guiding principles are optimization and efficiency, and making every punch count is certainly a biblical concept:

{{% ichthys-translation p="1 Corinthians 9:24-27" src="https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm#1st%20Corinthians%209:25-27" %}}
**24** Don't you know that all the runners in the stadium run the race, but that only one receives the prize? Run in such a way so as to achieve what you are after. **25** And again, everyone involved in competition exercises self-control in all respects. Those athletes go through such things so that they may receive a perishable crown of victory, but we do it to receive an imperishable one. **26** So as I run this race of ours, I'm heading straight for the finish line; and as I box this bout of ours, I'm making every punch count. **27** I'm "pummeling my body", one might say, bringing myself under strict control so that, after having preached [the gospel] to others, I might not myself be disqualified [from receiving the prize we all seek].

Think about it this way: there are only so many resources (like time, energy, money, and so forth) available to you at any given point in time. The more efficient you are, the more resources you have to spend on things that are actually important, like Bible reading, Bible study, prayer, and ministry more generally.

It is for this reason that I view this other website of mine as part of my service to the Church, even though a lot of the content is not overtly spiritual. I have been fascinated with efficiency for a long time now (I studied industrial engineering, which is all about process efficiency, for a time at Georgia Tech), and have put a lot of thought into things over the years. Readers of this ministry may find the contents of this other website of mine to be helpful. Here's some of the things I write about on this other site:

* Productivity and Efficiency (including, notably, the fields of meta-learning, organization, and goal-setting)
* Gear (making wise decisions in regards to purchasing physical products, in order to live lives that effectively balance comfort, minimalism, and frugality)
* Software (making full use of all the capabilities computers have to offer)
* Exercise (boosting mood, energy levels, and metabolism by working out)
* Nutrition (eating a healthy and well-balanced diet to keep our bodies running smoothly)
* Health more generally (strategies for dealing with stress, improving sleep, dealing with mental health challenges, and so on)
* Finances (avoiding unnecessary expenses, minimizing debt, practicing purchasing habits that give you the most value per dollar, and so on)

None of these things are any replacement for Bible teaching, but since these topics are relevant to living more generally, my hope is that improvements in these areas can help people sink more resources into spiritual matters.
