   This site copies the practice that Ichthys.com (the ministry I came up under) has of answering reader questions over email and then posting them once enough have accumulated. This page describes this concept of posted correspondence according to how my ministry does things.

By "posted correspondence," I mean the subtype of Q&As (Reader Correspondence) that deals with actual email conversations rather than the subtype that is entirely self-generated by me.

## Peculiarities with posted correspondence

### This content is not continually updated and revised in the normal way

Not being able to update videos in any time-efficient way is one thing (see [the caveats surrounding this site's recordings of online Bible studies](/site/recordings-of-online-bible-studies/#caveats-with-these-recordings-of-the-online-bible-studies)), but what of posted email correspondence? Such conversations could hypothetically be transparently updated over time, yet I still choose not to do such when Q&As involve communication with other people. Why? Because I don't ever want to misrepresent the words of others.

Let's say I clean up my writing from a response I sent someone, and overwrite what I actually sent them with my new shiny version. Their writing is all based on what I actually sent, but since my new version is what readers of the Q&A see, they might get a warped view of the exchange.

Most of the time this might not present much of a problem. For example, if I'm just making an explanation I wrote better, then there's really not much harm to come from that. But what if the conversation is a bit more heated, with points and counterpoints made? If I change "my side" of the discussion, that is kind of like winners rewriting the history books.

All the Q&As are anonymous, it is true, so one might argue that these would be victimless crimes, as it were. But the thought of it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so my policy is to post all conversations as they really happened (absenting personal information and circumstances, of course).

With this being said, the benefits of being able correct and/or update my writing are undeniable. The question is thus if there some way to have my cake and eat it too?

#### Post hoc notes

The phrase ["post hoc"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/post%20hoc) essentially means "after the fact." The problem with updating writing from past exchanges transparently is that the reader is never made aware that changes were made since the exchange. But as long as I clearly label changes as post hoc notes -- notes containing information added during or after publication rather than being part of the initial exchange -- then no one can get the wrong idea about things.

Some notes may be added "in-line" while others may be too long for this, so that they are instead contained in sections with a different, purple background color (much in the same way [special content sections](/site/special-content-sections/) are marked out, as described above). Here's examples of both kinds of post hoc notes with Lorem Ipsum text:

##### In-line post hoc note

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [**Post hoc note:** this is an in-line note], sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

##### Longer post hoc note

### This content is not ever rewritten to focus on maximum accessibility, a focus all the other writing on the site has

Based on this same principle of not rewriting the history of conversations that actually happened, I do not ever edit the writing from these posted exchanges after-the-fact to focus on maximum accessibility (a focus all the other writing on this site has).

Since writing in a very accessible way takes extra time and effort (ever tried to explain an advanced scientific concept to a young child, without being able to use big words or difficult concepts? It's time-consuming and difficult!), and many or even most people I end up corresponding with can handle writing that is not so toned-down, I do not as a practice try to write at a lower level in email conversations. Perhaps even more importantly, writing at a lower level with people who don't need it might come off as patronizing on my part, or otherwise be taken in the wrong way.

Now, if I know a correspondent's background and perceive that writing at a lower level would help them understand me better, then of course I'll do that. That's part of being a good teacher. The point is that in all cases other than this (cases wherein the conversation did not proceed at a lower level), simplifying my own words might warp the reader's perception of the conversation that actually happened (compare the above discussion). At the same time, I know more or less what I was thinking when I wrote things, so the overall damage would at least be contained. In contrast to this, imagine all the hidden shoals in me trying to simplify the writing of others -- without being inside their head, how do I know if I even properly understand what it is they were trying to say?

For these reasons, hopefully it is clear why I do not even attempt to rewrite posted correspondence at a lower level.

#### In terms of writing level, where does posted correspondence stand?

Accessibility of writing aside, what about [the differences between higher-level and lower-level writing sections](/site/writing-level/#higher-and-lower-writing-levels-on-this-site): showing/hiding technical discussion sections, and using different Bible versions for quoted scripture? Which set of behaviors does posted correspondence align with?

The short answer is that posted correspondence is locked into a higher writing level: any technical discussion sections that show up cannot be hidden, and all quoted scripture will show up in the version that was actually used in the exchange.

All this is so because correspondents in the exchanges may ask about these things in particular, meaning that hiding or otherwise changing technical discussion sections and quoted scripture versions would lead to lots of confusion. If a site reader hides all technical discussion sections, but the correspondent in an exchange had asked about something I said in a technical discussion section, what then? And what about about if the correspondent in an exchange had asked questions regarding a specific scripture version, as in "Why does the NLT translate like this here in this verse?"
