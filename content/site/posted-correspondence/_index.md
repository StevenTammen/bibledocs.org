## Peculiarities with posted correspondence in the questions and answers section

By "posted correspondence," I mean the two subtypes of Q&As (Reader Correspondence, Mentor Correspondence) that deal with actual email conversations rather than the subtype that is entirely self-generated by me.

### This content is not continually updated and revised in the normal way

Not being able to update videos in any time-efficient way is one thing, but what of posted email correspondence? Such conversations could hypothetically be transparently updated over time, yet I still choose not to do such when Q&As involve communication with other people. Why? Because I don't ever want to misrepresent the words of others.

Let's say I clean up my writing from a response I sent someone, and overwrite what I actually sent them with my new shiny version. Their writing is all based on what I actually sent, but since my new version is what readers of the Q&A see, they might get a warped view of the exchange.

Most of the time this might not present much of a problem. For example, if I'm just making an explanation I wrote better, then there's really not much harm to come from that. But what if the conversation is a bit more heated, with points and counterpoints made? If I change "my side" of the discussion, that is kind of like winners rewriting the history books.

All the Q&As are anonymous, it is true, so one might argue that these would be victimless crimes, as it were. But the thought of it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so my policy is to post all conversations as they really happened, absenting personal information and circumstances.

With this being said, the benefits of being able correct and/or update my writing are undeniable. The question is thus if there some way to have my cake and eat it too?

#### Post hoc notes

The phrase ["post hoc"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/post%20hoc) essentially means "after the fact." The problem with updating writing from past exchanges transparently is that the reader is never made aware that changes were made since the exchange. But as long as I clearly label changes as post hoc notes -- notes containing information added during or after publication rather than being part of the initial exchange -- then no one can get the wrong idea about things.

Some notes may be added "in-line" while others may be too long for this, so that they are instead contained in sections with a different, purple background color (much in the same way [special content sections](#special-content-sections) are marked out, as described above). Here's examples of both kinds of post hoc notes with Lorem Ipsum text:

##### In-line post hoc note

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [**Post hoc note:** this is an in-line note], sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

##### Longer post hoc note

### This content is not ever rewritten at a lower writing level

Based on this same principle of not rewriting the history of conversations that actually happened, I do not offer any posted correspondence in a lower level version with simplified writing.

Simplifying my own words might warp the reader's perception of the conversation that actually happened (compare the above discussion), but at the same time, I know more or less what I was thinking when I wrote things, so the overall damage would at least be contained. In contrast to this, imagine all the hidden shoals in me trying to simplify the writing of others -- without being inside their head, how do I know if I even properly understand what it is they were trying to say? Hopefully it is clear then why I do not even attempt to rewrite posted correspondence at a lower level.
