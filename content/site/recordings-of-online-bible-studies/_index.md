I run three different online Bible studies (a general Bible study, a Greek study, and a Hebrew study), record our meetings, and [post the videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFk7khraAKf68DZ5GeYEFIw/playlists). The recordings of these groups are the only spiritual content from this ministry in video form.

While the video recordings themselves live on YouTube, this site does make use of the recordings from time to time. Some recordings of the Greek and Hebrew studies will make appearances on pages from the [Greek Resources](/greek-resources) and [Hebrew Resources](/hebrew-resources) content types (respectively), and the general Bible study has a content type of its own for its recordings: [Study Group Recordings](/study-group-recordings).

## Caveats with these recordings of the online Bible studies

There are several important caveats that should be kept in mind with these recordings of the online Bible studies.

### 1. These videos may not represent my current views

While, like all responsible teachers, I endeavor to only teach those things I am myself confident in, this does not make me immune from being wrong. Even the very best teachers -- people with far more knowledge and experience than myself -- may come to see that they have been mistaken about something when new evidence rolls in.

Because there is no time-efficient mechanism for updating these video recordings, they are never updated or corrected over time, unlike all the written content on this site. For this reason, there is always the possibility that these videos contain things that are incorrect, or at least not-quite-correct.

### 2. These videos contain “shooting from the hip”

While I do prepare for the meetings of the study groups, a lot of what is said is ad-hoc, coming off the top of my head. I do try to avoid being *too* loose with things, but there is no way to get around the fact that these study recordings contain some degree of me "shooting from the hip," unlike the more rigorous written materials of this site. This might mean that I occasionally make remarks that are simply incorrect, I put the emphasis somewhere it shouldn’t be, and things of this sort.

While at times, the consequences of me shooting from the hip end up being little more than me being somewhat inelegant in my speech, it is occasionally more than just this. As a rule of thumb, I would say that I am actually straight up wrong fairly infrequently, but phrase things in a less-than-optimal way much more frequently.

### 3. These videos contain the thoughts of others

I am not the only person talking on these recordings. I have made the point above that you ought to take my extemporaneous speech on the recordings with a grain of salt, but I can vouch even less for the thoughts of others.

In general, many of the folks who participate are trustworthy and knowledgeable, but these are just generalizations, and even insightful people sometimes stumble.

If I *really* disagree with something someone else said, I will generally challenge it. However, this does not mean that I necessarily agree with everything else that I don’t as explicitly challenge. For example, sometimes it can be difficult to constructively critique a statement, or it simply wouldn’t be very profitable to do so.

Oftentimes I find that I disagree with phrasing more than anything else; that is, I would probably try to make a statement more rigorous, less blunt (and potentially offensive), or perhaps less absolutist (as if it must necessarily be true, with no room for debate).

### What is the upshot of all these observations?

For all of the reasons above, if something said in one of these study recordings seems “off” or “fishy,” I highly recommend you look on the site to see if the topic is covered in a written study somewhere. It is possible that the (more up-to-date, more rigorous) written study will correctly handle something that is incorrect in the video, or simply cover it better.
