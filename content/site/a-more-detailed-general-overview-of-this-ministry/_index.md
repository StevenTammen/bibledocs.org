## Content focus

For this ministry, I have felt led to focus on two main types of things:

1. Basic, introductory teachings.
2. More advanced teachings that are considered "difficult" and "controversial."

### Introductory teachings

Just as children must learn to walk before they can run, so too must Christians learn "the basics" before they can successfully navigate the complicated and difficult facets of the truth.

Some people might make light of introductory Bible teaching, as if it were just for children. While perhaps there are teaching materials out there that justify a degree of this derision (the sort that whitewash the Bible so that children get the mistaken idea that nobody who dies ever stays dead, for example; teaching children about the resurrection of Jesus and the raising of Lazarus, but not the beheading of John the Baptist or the stoning of Steven), the "introductory" label on this site in no way means that these materials are misleading due to oversimplification or selective attention.

To put things a bit differently, while it is true that these materials are targeted at less advanced Christians, that does not for this reason mean that they are hand-wavy or insubstantial. Rather, the idea is to present an option for learning core essentials of the Christian faith in a no-frills sort of way. If you view the truth in your heart as a structure that is built up brick-by-brick, these essentials would comprise the foundation on which the rest of the structure rests. If you have a faulty foundation -- cracks here, rotting support beams there -- the entire rest of your building is at risk of being compromised. (Compare Matthew 7:24-27).

In the wider context of teaching ministries I recommend, these introductory materials are targeting a level somewhat below even the simplest writings on [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/). The idea is to take new believers from a point of almost complete ignorance of the Bible to the point where they can handle more advanced teaching like that found on Ichthys.

### Difficult and controversial teachings

After gaining a good foundation in the truth, Christians will be able to handle "solid food" (in the manner of Hebrews 5:12-14). The type of difficult-to-accept and controversial content that I am targeting here, to push the analogy even a bit further, is not the kind of solid food that goes down easily (i.e., teaching that is definitely more advanced, but is neither particularly hard to accept nor controversial), but the kind with bones that get stuck in one's throat on the way down.

The general idea behind this type of content is to cover those things that trip people up and give them trouble more than those things that are clearer and more easily accepted (the "solid food without bones," as it were).

So, for example, this site spends time:

* Teaching that most of the church visible today is in a state of decay and lukewarmness. Contrast this with most modern sensibilities about the state of local churches in America, which tend to be alarmist about the number of young people not showing up to churches on Sunday mornings, while not much questioning the actual spiritual state of said churches.
* Teaching that the church visible (contrast the Church proper with a capital C -- the body of all actual believers on Earth) has been off-the-rails for the majority of its existence. Contrast this with most Christians thinking that while there were periods of poor choices made by Christians throughout history (e.g., the crusades, the inquisition, recurring violence between Catholics and Protestants in Europe, witch hunts, etc.), the church has historically functioned largely as it as it was supposed to.
* Teaching that water baptism was a distinctly Jewish ritual that continued in the transitional period of the Church (as described in the book of Acts) due to the largely Jewish character of the very early Church, but should no longer be practiced by Church-Age Christians, people who have neither temporal proximity nor cultural ties to the Jewish baptism of the John the Baptist. Contrast the opinions of literally all other modern Christians, who, despite never seeming to be able to agree whether or not children should be baptized and whether people must be completely dunked or just sprinkled, are completely united in viewing water baptism as unquestionably important.
* Teaching a doctrine known as the Genesis gap that holds that God blacked out the universe between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 (after the rebellion of Satan and his followers), making the creation account in Genesis actually an account of *re*-creation. (Incidentally, this explains the age of the universe, the age of earth, the bulk of the fossil record, and reconciles Ezekiel 28:11ff. with Satan's already-fallen state in Genesis 3). Contrast this with all the other more-common positions on creation, such as day-age theory, 6,000-year-old young earth creationism, theistic evolution, and so forth.
* Teaching a fairly specific chronology of human history that follows a pattern of seven millennial "days" (compare the seven days of creation, and note especially the parallel between God's seventh day of rest and the Millennium described in Revelation), chronology which most controversially identifies the year 2026 as the start date of the tribulation (an eschatological event kicking off the end-times). Contrast this with the view by most modern Christians that "no man knows the day or the hour" (which is actually referring to the second coming of Christ rather than the beginning of the tribulation, but I digress).
* Etc.

While not spending so much time on more advanced Bible teachings that are less controversial or hard to accept. This does not mean that such topics will never be covered, simply that they are not so much the focus of this ministry in particular.

## Methodology

### Focused and to-the-point

The two other Bible teaching ministries I recommend most -- [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) and [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists) -- have teaching that is, on the whole, quite long and technically complex.

While this site too will have its share of longform writings, as much as possible, the content on this site will highly prioritize conciseness, focus, and clarity. The idea is to take away some of the barrier of entry for people who can't handle hundreds of pages of complicated exegesis, hopefully without jeopardizing the integrity of the truth in the process. (The goal is essentially to take away everything that can be taken away, but no more; or, to use a quote oft attributed to Einstein: "everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler").

"Short and simple" is probably a bit misleading as the contents of this site may be neither short nor simple according to certain canons of evaluation, but the idea is to make teaching "short*er* and simpl*er*" -- as much as practically possible without compromising on the truth.

### Bible centered

All materials on this site are focused on the Biblical text. I mean this in a more or less literal sense: things that the Bible doesn't address I do not either, unless there is relevant [indirect reasoning](/site/special-content-sections/#indirect-reasoning) relating to the subject. Bible teaching without biblical support is in truth no such thing!

The only real exception to this otherwise absolute principle is discussion of application, which always depends upon personal circumstances. Since application isn't black-and-white like normal Bible teaching, discussion of application inherently includes more in the way of reasoning and observations that are not ultimately traceable to scripture, and this isn't problematic in this specific context.

This ministry's scripture-focused approach means that writing on this site will pull in information that is necessary to accurately determine and explain the meaning of the biblical text while avoiding essentially everything else. Among other things, this means that Bible teaching on the site contains discussions relating to:

* Greek and Hebrew
* Hermeneutics
* Textual criticism
* Ancient history and culture
* Etc.

While avoiding:

* Opinion and conjecture
* Arguments appealing to things other than scripture, like those appealing to famous people, scholarly consensus, centralized church authority, tradition, and so forth.
* Etc.

### Application aware

This site attempts to structure its content to make application straightforward. Sometimes a lot of the challenge in the Christian life has less to do with intellectual understanding of the truth, and more to do with figuring out *how* to apply to it to the hugely varied, intensely messy, and inevitably complicated circumstances of life down in the trenches of the spiritual battlefield.

What this means in practice is that the writings of this site will spend time examining variables to consider in given matters of application instead of glossing over application questions without any comment at all. Rather than coming up with dogmatic sets of recommendations for given matters of application, this exercise is supposed to jumpstart the personal process that all individual Christians must go through to apply the truth to their own lives.

Discussion of application shows up in specially marked out sections, which you can read about [here](/site/special-content-sections/#application).

### Level appropriate

This site offers different levels of writing on two different measurement scales: 

* There are three [content levels](/site/content-level) (basic, intermediate, and advanced) that are a function of spiritual difficulty (compare Hebrews 5:12-14): some things are for new believers, and some things are for advanced Christians.
* There are two [writing levels](/site/writing-level) (higher and lower) that are a function of overall writing difficulty: the lower writing level uses a lower-reading-level Bible version ([the NIrV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_International_Reader%27s_Version)) in quoting scripture, and also omits complicated technical discussion. All writing on this site (regardless of writing level) strives to be as accessible as possible by avoiding unnecessary complexity.

The goal in offering multiple levels of materials is for the site to be useful to as wide a range of people as possible; by intentionally tailoring the materials I offer to different groups of readers, it is my hope that all will be able to find some things on this site that are a good fit for their present level.
