While the static site generator I use ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) as well as others allow for content organization at the page level via tags, I find this unsatisfactory. Instead, I want to be able to categorize content at the level of headings on pages.

For this reason, I build my own subject index that links down to this level of specificity. Currently I am manually building it, but as content scales I will write a script to do it automatically before I push (see [git hooks](https://githooks.com/#:~:text=Git%20hooks%20are%20scripts%20that,limited%20by%20a%20developer's%20imagination.)).
