summary: >-
   All the teaching materials of this ministry may be freely used and accessed, and even remixed and reworked (for different ministry purposes, e.g.), as long as proper attribution is given and the materials are not being charged for. However, the same copyright terms must apply to any derived materials, such that they are also made freely available to all for noncommercial use. You could summarize all this in a sentence by stating that this ministry is very much against charging for and making money off of Bible teaching, so as long you don't run afoul of that, you're most of the way there.

This site is dedicated to Bible teaching, offered freely to all; this is a ministry of grace. For this reason, while the copyright of the materials of this site does allow for reuse of these materials in essentially any way you want, you cannot charge for them; further, any time you make use of these materials in a substantial way, you must make your work also freely available to all, under this same license (see [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)).
