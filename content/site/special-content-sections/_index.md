## Special content sections

I take pains to mark out various sections in the writing on this site, according to the contents they contain. There are two big reasons for this practice:

1. Marking out the content sections makes explicit boundaries between types of content. For example, being completely clear in distinguishing teaching from application is important for ensuring that people don't become dogmatic about things that the Bible does not actually teach as global absolutes (i.e., become dogmatic about things that should be specific to only their particular circumstances).
2. Marking out the content sections makes it very easy to skim writings to find content of a specific type or to avoid content of a specific type when reading. For example, if someone is interested in reading mostly about application, they can look for green sections in the text and quickly skim over the rest. If someone doesn't have a technical background and wants to skip technical discussion (involving matters of Greek, Hebrew, analysis of scholarly positions, and so forth), they can simply scroll through orange sections in the text.

Text that does not fall into any of the content sections (i.e., text without any special background color) should generally be taken to be Bible teaching with direct support from scripture.

You can see examples of each of the content sections below, with Lorem Ipsum text in place of actual content. In the wild, these content sections may end up being quite a bit longer, even containing multiple headers and sub-headers.

### Quotes

{{% quote src="#quotes" text="Source" %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /quote %}}

I find that quoting text in larger blocks (even multiple paragraphs) is often useful. While many formatting procedures indent block-quotes, this ends up wasting a lot of space over the long-term. Changing the background color while otherwise leaving the styling the same is the most practical way to handle longer quotes, and that is exactly what is done here.

The source for a given quote is linked in the label of the section ("Quote from {Source}") in almost all cases. (The only real exception is when the source is not linkable for some reason, such as if a website no longer exists).

### Sidenotes

{{% sidenote %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /sidenote %}}

Perhaps the most self-explanatory of all these special content sections, sidenote sections contain exactly what you think they would: writing that is only sorta-kinda related to what is under current discussion.

As a general principle, I try to avoid remarks that are well and truly off-topic, so these sections contain things that are related but only tangentially so.

These sidenote sections and footnotes are used somewhat interchangeably, although I probably use these more overall since they can be quickly scanned/skimmed visually whereas footnotes cannot.

### Indirect reasoning

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /indirect-reasoning %}}

Ultimately all Bible teaching needs to be based on scripture. However, this does not mean that all teaching can necessarily point to specific verses that directly prove the point at hand.

For example, the Bible says nothing directly about smoking marijuana. However, the Bible clearly states that we are to submit to government authority (Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17). If the government makes smoking marijuana illegal (as it is in some states in the United States), then it becomes wrong for Christians to do it, even though the Bible never specifically calls it out as wrong. Additionally, since being drunk and being high are similar in the important loss-of-conscious-control aspect, all the verses condemning drunkenness can also be indirectly applied to smoking marijuana.

As another example, consider the question of arranged marriage. While not common in Western society, there are still areas in the world where it is more the norm than not (such as some places in India). Yet, some parties want to legalistically ban the practice of arranged marriage for all people. There is no verse in scripture along the lines of "there is no problem with arranged marriage" (i.e., a verse directly apropos to the question at hand); however, we have plenty examples of it in scripture without any negative comment. For example, Isaac and Rebecca, and even Mary and Joseph, the human parents of our Lord and Savior. So, using indirect reasoning, we can still dogmatically say that there is no problem with arranged marriage, even though the Bible doesn't say such directly.

Keep in mind that this kind of teaching is different from opinion and conjecture. Teachers have a responsibility to teach the truth (which is objective and absolute), not personal opinions. No, what this content section deals with is not conjecture, but conclusions that are are reached somewhat indirectly from reasoning based on direct scripture.

So why bother marking it out, rather than having all teaching presented as fundamentally the same? For one thing, while we as teachers can still be confident in indirect arguments from scripture if we go about the process the right way, by their very nature, there are more "things to go wrong" -- it is easier for teachers to mess things up in indirect arguments, simply because there are more steps between the interpretation in question and scripture. When the Bible says something directly, it's pretty hard to get things wrong, but when you have to string together a more complex argument to get from A to B, imperfect human logic can lead to incorrect conclusions.

In this way, marking out indirect reasoning can signal to readers "you ought to check this section a bit more closely to make sure you see how the conclusions are ultimately traceable to direct scripture."

#### Arguments from probability

Arguments from probability deserve a special mention. Generally, these arguments are not deductive in nature, but inductive. This means that they don't really mesh with the black-and-white approach to truth advisable for Bible teaching. However, given that they may still serve as guideposts when considering things, they may occasionally show up in these sections of indirect reasoning (and also application sections, as below).

A good example of an appropriate use of an argument from probability can be seen in the debate surrounding the false notion that the gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew (e.g., [see here](https://ichthys.com/mail-Matthew%20in%20Hebrew.htm)). If Matthew were in fact originally written in Hebrew, we would expect to have multiple mentions of this very important fact (given that the New Testament is exclusively written in Greek, were Matthew to be written in Hebrew, it would be very noteworthy) in early Christian writings from Irenaeus and the like. However, we don't. Based on everything we know textually, the gospel of Matthew shows up overwhelmingly in Greek (and quite early too -- e.g., in some of the earliest papyri we have), and while Hebrew copies of Matthew do eventually appear, they are late translations intended for evangelism.

People who push for Matthew being written originally in Hebrew might make an argument along the lines of "Matthew was originally written in Hebrew, but only Greek copies happened to get preserved due to historical happenstance, and therefore early Christian writers didn't know this important secret" (or something along these lines). While we have no direct scriptural evidence we can use to refute such a claim, an argument from probability shines light on what this claim really is: complete and utter rubbish.

### Application

{{% application %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /application %}}

As already mentioned several times on this page, the discussions of application on this site are noteworthy relative to other content since they are the only writings that contain things other than direct exposition from scripture. This is because application is very much an individual matter.

Each of us has a unique combination of spiritual gifts given to us at salvation (not to mention our own inborn talents and aptitudes, things also coming ultimately from the hand of God), along with personal experiences that have shaped us over many years, and a collection of present circumstances limiting the sample space of workable choices before us. Put simply, each of us is unqiue with unique circumstances, so what is right for me may not be right for you, and vice versa.

Of course, some things in scripture *are* completely black and white (e.g., "flee *porneia*"); these are not areas of application. On the whole, however, these black-and-white matters only compose a small fraction of the total number of things facing us each and every day. For this reason, it is vitally important that Christians learn to hone their own spiritual discernment and learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit in their hearts.

#### The content of these application sections

Writing in these special application sections does not set out to prescribe but to describe; rather than coming to conclusions, individual application sections instead focus on:

* Examination of potential personal circumstances, and how different circumstances might change the fabric of the decision space.
* Identification of variables that are likely to be relevant and important.
* Analysis and discussion of these variables based on data, (my) personal experience, general observation, and reason and logic (e.g., arguments from probability). Cost-benefit analyses, evaluations of pros and cons of various options, and other things of this sort are used. (On the concept of weighing different variables in making decisions, see [this page](https://www.steventammen.com/pages/decision-analysis/) from my personal website).
* Exploration of routes of application, often including visual flowcharts.

Following the concept that "a picture is worth a thousand words," these flowcharts help visualize decisions within various matters of application. Let me here emphasize that, like all suggestions regarding application, these are not to be taken as hard-and-fast rules, but merely places to start examining potential routes of application based on various circumstances. Here's an example relating to the question of how much to work:

[![Career Decisions](career-decisions.png)](career-decisions.png)

On these flowcharts, the gray ovals represent the start point and end point(s) for the process, the beige diamonds represent choices within the process (with the orange labels labeling the decision branches), and the white rectangles represent sub-processes to be completed.

We need to be relying first and foremost on the guidance of the Holy Spirit to get things right, but this does not mean that we cannot or should not also utilize more systematic methods like those described here (analyzing problems, weighing considerations, and making evidence-based decisions).

#### Ours is a God of the impossible, and faith is a muscle that must be exercised

One final caveat regarding application is that while it is reasonable and appropriate to make a habit of "doing our homework" when making decisions (as in the more systemetized process above), it is important that we not wed ourselves *only* to practical considerations, for ours is a God of the impossible. For example:

* Moses, God's chosen representative to appeal to Pharoah to free the Israelites from Egypt, was not a good speaker (Exodus 4:10, Exodus 6:12, Exodus 6:30-7:2).
* David, still a young lad, was the one to defeat Goliath, rather than a seasoned miltary veteran.
* Peter, a fisherman without apparent educational credentials (compare Acts 4:13), became an important leader in the early Church (compare his influence in Acts 2).

In all these cases, "logic" would demand a different course of action than what was ordained in the (perfect and singular) Will of God. Yet these men, in faith, acted as God would have them act nonetheless. Their example should not be lost on us.

Faith is a muscle that must be exercised. Sometimes God sends tests our way that are more or less along the lines of choosing to believe His testimony (as found in the Bible) over what our eyes may see and our ears may hear. Our systematic analysis may tell us to do one thing, for example, while we perhaps feel led to something that ranks quite poorly in that analysis.

The line to walk here is appreciating the importance of faith in our decisions (and taking great pains to not be closed to paths that require us to trust God and not have everything perfectly figured out) while not at the same time inherently valuing decisions that require lots of faith, as if they were somehow better on account of them being more impractical and unrealistic. In other words, while sometimes stepping out against seemingly impossible odds is exercising godly faith (so we should never truly count most paths of application out, even if they seem unworkable from our perspective), sometimes doing such is also just foolish. Knowing the one from the other is why application is hard, and requires spiritual growth to the point of maturity.

### Technical discussion

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /technical-discussion %}}

[As described above](#writing-level), the higher level of writing on this site sometimes contains technical discussion that is not included in the lower level of writing for the same content. In general, the purpose of this discussion is to formally justify points made without toning things down much. This is not to say that discussions that fall into this special content section are made purposefully impenetrable or anything like that, but simply that the discussion is not in any way tempered for an audience with less knowledge.

The upshot of this for most people is that you can probably safely ignore these sections unless you are interested in the full treatment. I am careful to include "the upshot" of technical discussions in the normal text, meaning that these sections are completely optional. (If you skip them, I won't suddenly reference something from them further down, e.g.).

The exact topics of technical discussion sections can vary, but the main idea is that they are focused on things that lay Christians really need not worry about understanding fully unless they have particular interest. A non-exhaustive list of things that can show up in technical discussion sections:

* Analysis, critique, and comparison of scholarly and doctrinal viewpoints on various matters.
* Many things related to Greek and Hebrew
* Many things relating to textual criticism
* Many things relating to more complicated topics in hermeneutics
* More complicated facets of biblical archaeology
* Etc.

### Cautionary notes

{{% /cautionary-note %}}

Content falling into these sections is of two primary types:

1. Warnings against false teaching
2. Warnings against traps and pitfalls in application

Whether or not you read these sections (and/or how much time you spend seriously considering them) should naturally depend some on your overall level of spiritual maturity. Once a certain level of maturity is obtained, we are inherently more resistant to being blown off course by things that are false (see Ephesians 4:14-16), and also have more spiritual discernment to help us better grasp the general character of what we ought to be about (Romans 12:2). However, it never hurts to get a degree of exposure and inoculation to dangers in false teaching and problematic application, so that when you encounter them in the wild, they don't take you off-guard. (The principle is much the same here as with vaccines in medicine).

The false teaching under consideration runs the full spectrum, from almost blindingly obvious things ("Give me money for my private yacht and God will bless you!") to the much more subtle.

The traps and pitfalls in application also vary in nuance, ranging from "No, honoring your parents does not mean you should help them deal drugs" to less simple matters more like "Sometimes it can be a mistake to be too specific in the advice you give to impressionable new believers as they may come to rely on your word more than their own developing spiritual discernment, which can cause problems for both you and especially them down the road."

Some people might protest that application is inherently an individual matter (see above) -- how can you dogmatically call some things out as "wrong" given this? Perhaps the best way to answer this is by analogy. In college, I had a Greek professor who often liked to remind us (particularly after tests!) that "Just because there are many correct translations does not mean that there are not incorrect ones." The same idea holds here. While we cannot be dogmatic about what someone else definitely should do, we *can* be dogmatic about some things they definitely *shouldn't* do.
