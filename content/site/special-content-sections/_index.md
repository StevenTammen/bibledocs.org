   You may have come across sections on content pages that have a different background color (silver, yellow, orange, green, and so on). What are these sections? Why are they marked out like this? What are the various different types of sections used on this site? This page tries to answer all such questions.
---

I take pains to mark out various sections in the writing on this site, according to the contents they contain. There are two big reasons for this practice:

1. Marking out the content sections makes explicit boundaries between types of content. For example, being completely clear in distinguishing teaching from application is important for ensuring that people don't become dogmatic about things that the Bible does not actually teach as global absolutes (i.e., become dogmatic about things that should be specific to only their particular circumstances).
2. Marking out the content sections makes it very easy to skim writings to find content of a specific type or to avoid content of a specific type when reading. For example, if someone is interested in reading mostly about application, they can look for green sections in the text and quickly skim over the rest. If someone doesn't have a technical background and wants to skip technical discussion (involving matters of Greek, Hebrew, analysis of scholarly positions, and so forth), they can simply scroll through orange sections in the text.

Text that does not fall into any of the content sections (i.e., text without any special background color) should generally be taken to be Bible teaching with direct support from scripture.

You can see examples of each of the content sections below, with Lorem Ipsum text in place of actual content. In the wild, these content sections may end up being quite a bit longer, even containing multiple headers and sub-headers.

### Quotes

{{% quote src="#quotes" text="Source" %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /quote %}}

I find that quoting text in larger blocks (even multiple paragraphs) is often useful. While many formatting procedures indent block-quotes, this ends up wasting a lot of space over the long-term. Changing the background color while otherwise leaving the styling the same is the most practical way to handle longer quotes, and that is exactly what is done here.

The source for a given quote is linked in the label of the section ("Quote from {Source}") in almost all cases. (The only real exception is when the source is not linkable for some reason, such as if a website no longer exists).

### Examples

{{% example %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /example %}}

Perhaps the most self-explanatory of all the special content sections, example sections contain, well, examples.

Typically, examples are given inline (that is, within the body of the text itself), but if they get kind of long, then I'll pull them out and stick them in these sections.

### Sidenotes

{{% sidenote %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /sidenote %}}

Sidenote sections contain exactly what you think they would: writing that is only sorta-kinda related to what is under current discussion.

As a general principle, I try to avoid remarks that are well and truly off-topic, so these sections contain things that are related but only tangentially so.

These sidenote sections and footnotes are used somewhat interchangeably, although I probably use these more overall since they can be quickly scanned/skimmed visually whereas footnotes cannot.

### Indirect reasoning

{{% /indirect-reasoning %}}

This site employs two types of indirect reasoning: indirect reasoning that uses scripture (more common by far), and arguments from probability.

#### Indirect reasoning that uses scripture

##### Bible teaching should focus on the Bible

Essentially all Bible teaching needs to contain discussion of scripture. With this being said, Bible teaching done properly does account for matters relating to the historical transmission of the Biblical text -- dealing with an academic discipline known as *philology* -- as well as matters of ancient history and culture, archaeology, and a few other things that cannot be established from the text alone. ([See the below section on arguments from probability](#arguments-from-probability)). Nonetheless, it is not incorrect to say that in the vast majority of cases, good Bible teaching's defining feature is its almost-singular focus on the Word of God. However, this does not mean that all teaching can necessarily point to specific verses that directly prove the point at hand.

##### Example: Marijuana

For example, the Bible says nothing directly about smoking marijuana. However, the Bible clearly states that we are to submit to government authority (Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17). If the government makes smoking marijuana illegal (as it is in some states in the United States), then it becomes wrong for Christians to do it, even though the Bible never specifically calls it out as wrong. Additionally, since being drunk and being high are similar in the important loss-of-conscious-control aspect, all the verses condemning drunkenness can also be indirectly applied to smoking marijuana to the point that you become high.

##### Example: Arranged marriage

As another example, consider the question of arranged marriage. While not common in Western society, there are still areas in the world where it is more the norm than not (such as some places in India). Yet, some parties want to legalistically ban the practice of arranged marriage for all people. There is no verse in scripture along the lines of "there is no problem with arranged marriage" (that is, a verse directly relevant to the topic at hand); however, we have plenty examples of it in scripture without any negative comment. For example, Isaac and Rebecca, and even Mary and Joseph, the human parents of our Lord and Savior. So, using indirect reasoning, we can still dogmatically say that there is no inherent problem with arranged marriage, even though the Bible doesn't say such directly.

##### Why bother marking this kind of teaching out as different?

Keep in mind that this kind of teaching is different from opinion and conjecture. Teachers have a responsibility to teach the truth (which is objective and absolute), not personal opinions. No, what is under discussion here is not conjecture, but conclusions that are are reached somewhat indirectly from reasoning based on direct scripture.

So why bother marking it out, rather than having all teaching presented as fundamentally the same? For one thing, while we as teachers can still be confident in indirect arguments from scripture if we go about the process the right way, by their very nature, there are more "things to go wrong" -- it is easier for teachers to mess things up in indirect arguments, simply because there are more steps between the interpretation in question and scripture. When the Bible says something directly, it's pretty hard to get things wrong, but when you have to string together a more complex argument to get from A to B, imperfect human logic can lead to incorrect conclusions.

In this way, marking out indirect arguments from scripture can signal to readers "you ought to check this section a bit more closely to make sure you see how the conclusions are ultimately traceable to direct scripture."

#### Arguments from probability

Arguments from probability are another kind of indirect reasoning that deserve a special mention. Generally, these arguments are not deductive in nature, but inductive. This means that they don't mesh particularly well with the black-and-white approach to truth advisable for Bible teaching, and generally shouldn't be employed unless there is no other good choice.

##### What do I mean by "no other good choice?"

Most of the time a topic can be discussed in terms of scripture, even if indirectly, [as just discussed above](#indirect-reasoning-that-uses-scripture). As yet another example, consider that while the Bible doesn't actually explicitly talk about a specific kind of sin relating to cruel physical torture of others, it is not hard to come up with an airtight argument against it from scripture. Ever read Matthew 7:12 and Romans 3:8-9?

Occasionally there are topics that internal evidence of scripture is insufficient for addressing. Much of the time these topics aren't important enough to even talk about. (Hence why the Bible, in its limited space, doesn't bother addressing them).

In a small number of instances, however, there are topics that we need to take a hard stand on, but don't have any good arguments -- even indirect ones -- from scripture itself. Many of these topics are related to textual criticism, archaeology, and historical analysis.

These are the sort of cases where arguments from probability come into play.

##### Example: No, Matthew was not initially written in Hebrew

A good example of an appropriate use of an argument from probability can be seen in the debate surrounding the false notion that the gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew (e.g., [see here](https://ichthys.com/mail-Matthew%20in%20Hebrew.htm)). There is essentially no way to disprove such a notion with scripture itself, but we do want to strongly shut down any claims like this that challenge the trustworthiness of the Biblical text, as being able to confidently trust in the Bible is absolutely critical for lay Christians. In this case, without any scriptural evidence we can to turn to, our best weapon against this dangerous false position is an argument from probability.

If Matthew were in fact originally written in Hebrew, we would expect to have multiple mentions of this very important fact (given that the New Testament is exclusively written in Greek, were Matthew to be written in Hebrew, it would be very noteworthy) in early Christian writings. However, we don't. Based on everything we know textually, the gospel of Matthew shows up overwhelmingly in Greek (and quite early too -- e.g., in some of the earliest papyri we have), and while Hebrew copies of Matthew do eventually appear, they are late translations intended for evangelism.

Moreover, if all the Greek copies of Matthew were translations from a Hebrew original, we would expect a great deal of variation in the Greek text. (Compare the textual tradition of the Septuagint -- it is really appropriate to ask the question "which Septuagint?" since translation introduces so much instability in the text). However, we do not at all observe this. There is variation in the different exemplars of Matthew we have (as is normal in hand-copied ancient texts), but it is not markedly different from the variation found in, for example, Mark or Luke (the other two synoptic gospels).

People who push for Matthew being written originally in Hebrew might make an argument along the lines of "Matthew was originally written in Hebrew, but was translated into Greek very early, and only copies of this one single early Greek translation (rather than copies of multiple Greek translations from the Hebrew original) happened to get preserved due to historical happenstance, and therefore early Christian writers didn't know this important secret" (or something along these lines). Again, while we have no direct scriptural evidence we can use to refute such a claim, the argument from probability we have made above shines light on what this claim really is: complete and utter rubbish.

##### Conclusion

Arguments from probability comprise another weapon in our arsenal, another tool in our toolbox. Most of the time when we mention "indirect reasoning" in the context Bible teaching, we are referring to the practice of using the principles scripture teaches to weigh in on things it doesn't address directly. Every once in a while, however, "indirect reasoning" can refer to the practice of using things like textual criticism, archaeology, and historical analysis (somewhat imprecise inductive scholarly practices) to take a hard stand on some point that we are unable to talk about nearly at all in terms of scripture.

As long as this tool in our toolbox stays specialized and is only employed when appropriate (rather than trying to pound in nails with a screwdriver, for example), it can help us present ourselves to God as craftsmen unashamed, cutting straight the Word of Truth (2 Timothy 2:15).

### Application

{{% application %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /application %}}

The discussions of application on this site are noteworthy relative to other content since they are the only writings that contain things other than direct exposition from scripture. This is because application is very much an individual matter.

Each of us has a unique combination of spiritual gifts given to us at salvation (not to mention our own inborn talents and aptitudes, things also coming ultimately from the hand of God), along with personal experiences that have shaped us over many years, and a collection of present circumstances limiting the sample space of workable choices before us. Put simply, each of us is unique with unique circumstances, so what is right for me may not be right for you, and vice versa.

Of course, some things in scripture *are* completely black and white (e.g., "flee *porneia*"); these are not areas of application. On the whole, however, these black-and-white matters only compose a small fraction of the total number of things facing us each and every day. For this reason, it is vitally important that Christians learn to hone their own spiritual discernment and learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit in their hearts.

#### The content of these application sections

Writing in these special application sections does not set out to prescribe but to describe; rather than coming to conclusions, individual application sections instead focus on examining potential personal circumstances, and how different circumstances might be relevant. In other words, time is spent identifying possible variables in application.

Now, when making a decision, "weighing" variables is important: this one matters for me a lot, this one matters for me not so much, and so forth. This site avoid weighing variables in any fine-grained way (and thus avoids mapping out any actual possible routes of application) simply because these things are personal, and will necessarily vary by individual. (To be clear, they may still vary by individual even when everyone is doing exactly what God wants them to do -- because God calls all of us to different things).

We need to be relying first and foremost on the guidance of the Holy Spirit to get things right, but this does not mean that we cannot or should not also utilize more systematic methods like those described here (analyzing problems, weighing considerations, and making evidence-based decisions).

#### Ours is a God of the impossible, and faith is a muscle that must be exercised

One final caveat regarding application is that while it is reasonable and appropriate to make a habit of "doing our homework" when making decisions (as in the more systematized process with variables and so on above), it is important that we not wed ourselves *only* to practical considerations, for ours is a God of the impossible. For example:

* Moses, God's chosen representative to appeal to Pharaoh to free the Israelites from Egypt, was not a good speaker (Exodus 4:10, Exodus 6:12, Exodus 6:30-7:2).
* David, still a young lad, was the one to defeat Goliath, rather than a seasoned military veteran.
* Peter, a fisherman without apparent educational credentials (compare Acts 4:13), became an important leader in the early Church. (Compare his commanding influence in Acts 2).

In all these cases, "logic" would demand a different outcome than what was ordained in the (perfect and singular) Will of God. Yet these men, even against all odds, succeeded in doing what God would have them do, because they looked at their situations with eyes of faith. Their example should not be lost on us.

Faith is a muscle that must be exercised. Sometimes God sends tests our way that are more or less along the lines of choosing to believe His testimony (as found in the Bible) over what our eyes may see and our ears may hear. Our systematic analysis may tell us to do one thing, for example, while we perhaps feel led to something that ranks quite poorly in that analysis.

The line to walk here is appreciating the importance of faith in our decisions (and taking great pains to not be closed to paths that require us to trust God and not have everything perfectly figured out) while not at the same time inherently valuing decisions that require lots of faith, as if they were somehow better on account of them being more impractical and unrealistic. In other words, while sometimes stepping out against seemingly impossible odds is exercising godly faith (so we should never truly count most paths of application out, even if they seem unworkable from our material perspective), sometimes doing such is also just foolish. Knowing the one from the other is why application is hard, and requires spiritual growth to the point of maturity.

### Technical discussion

</div>

[As described on the page discussing writing level](/site/writing-level/#higher-and-lower-writing-levels-on-this-site), the higher-level writing on this site sometimes contains technical discussion that is not included in the lower-level writing for the same content. In general, the purpose of this discussion is to formally justify points made without toning things down completely. This is not to say that discussions that fall into this special content section are made purposefully impenetrable or anything like that, but simply that the discussion is not nearly as tempered for an audience with less knowledge.

The upshot of this for most people is that you can probably safely ignore these sections unless you are interested in the full treatment. I am careful to include summaries of the main points of technical discussion sections in the normal text (as appropriate), making these sections completely optional. This means, for example, that if you skip one, I won't suddenly reference something from it further down on the page.

The exact topics covered in technical discussion sections can vary, but the main idea is that they are focused on things that lay Christians really need not worry about understanding fully unless they have particular interest. A non-exhaustive list of things that can show up in technical discussion sections:

* Analysis, critique, and comparison of scholarly and doctrinal viewpoints on various matters.
* Many things relating to Greek and Hebrew
* Many things relating to textual criticism
* Many things relating to more advanced in hermeneutics
* Many things relating to more complicated facets of biblical archaeology
* Etc.

{{% /cautionary-note %}}

Content falling into these sections is of two primary types:

1. Warnings against false teaching
2. Warnings against traps and pitfalls in application

Whether or not you read these sections (and/or how much time you spend seriously considering them) should naturally depend some on your overall level of spiritual maturity. Once a certain level of maturity is obtained, we are inherently more resistant to being blown off course by things that are false (see Ephesians 4:14-16), and also have more spiritual discernment to help us better grasp the general character of what we ought to be about (Romans 12:2). However, it never hurts to get a degree of exposure and inoculation to dangers in false teaching and problematic application, so that when you encounter them in the wild, they don't take you off-guard. (The principle is much the same here as with vaccines in medicine).

The false teaching under consideration runs the full spectrum, from almost blindingly obvious things ("Give me money for my private yacht and God will bless you!") to the much more subtle.

The traps and pitfalls in application also vary in nuance, ranging from "No, honoring your parents does not mean you should help them deal drugs" to less simple matters more like "Sometimes it can be a mistake to be too specific in the advice you give to impressionable new believers as they may come to rely on your word more than their own developing spiritual discernment, which can cause problems for both you and especially them down the road."

Some people might protest that application is inherently an individual matter ([see above](#application)) -- given this, how can you dogmatically call some paths of application out as wrong? Perhaps the best way to answer this is by analogy. In college, I had a Greek professor who often liked to remind us (particularly after tests!) that "Just because there are many correct translations does not mean that there are not incorrect ones." The same idea holds here. While we cannot be dogmatic about what someone else definitely should do, we *can* be dogmatic about some things they definitely *shouldn't* do.
