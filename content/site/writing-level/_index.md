### Writing level

This site also tries to account for varied reading levels by offering two levels of writing that are different in terms of technical complexity and prose difficulty.

The higher level of writing on this site:

* Contains [technical discussion sections](#technical-discussion) centering around points of Greek and Hebrew grammar and lexicography, scholarly arguments about textual issues, difficult topics in biblical archaeology, and so forth.
* Has more complicated sentence structure and lots of stylistic variation, with many subordinate clauses, parenthetical statements, and complex flows of ideas.
* Is written formally in a rather high speech register. Perhaps the best way to put is that I actually unironically use words like notwithstanding, moreover, and furthermore.
* Is rather unrestrained in vocabulary usage and usage of foreign borrowings like the Latin phrases *par excellence* and *sine qua non*, the French *raison d'Ãªtre* and *hors de combat*, and other things like this.
* Is rather unrestrained in usage of idioms.
* Does not spend any time defining terms unless doing such is necessary to avoid ambiguity or connotational baggage.

While the lower level of writing on this site:

* Completely omits [technical discussion sections](#technical-discussion), and has a noticeably lower level of technical complexity. Writing glosses over a lot of the details in lieu of simpler explanations: "A Greek word taken by many to mean X actually means Y once you dig into it a bit more. This has Z implications."
* Has much simpler overall sentence structure. Writing contains mostly simple sentences, or two independent clauses joined by "and" or "but". Avoids complex subordinate clauses, lots of parenthetical statements, and other things of this sort.
* Is written informally in a more conversational speech register. This doesn't necessarily mean that the writing isn't rigorous, just that it doesn't sound so academic and stuffy.
* Is noticeably more muted in vocabulary usage and usage of foreign borrowings. Generally tries to avoid less-common and/or longer words and instead use more common and/or shorter words, to bring the overall reading level down.
* Tries to avoid idioms to make the writing easier for foreign readers to grasp.
* Spends more time defining terms rather than taking definitional knowledge for granted.

Even in the higher level of writing, I do try to avoid truly arcane words and academic abbreviations. The idea isn't to write in an overly erudite or scholastic manner, but simply to offer a higher level of writing for those that can handle it.

You can switch between the higher level version of a page and lower level version of a page by using the links in the menu sidebar titled, most creatively, "Higher level version" and "Lower level version." By default, the links on list pages across the site will be to the higher level versions of content, but you can make list pages default to the lower level versions of content by choosing the lower writing level [on the settings page](/settings/#writing-level).

#### Writing level and length

As a natural result of glossing over some of the details, the lower level versions of pages end up being shorter than the higher level versions. As [described above](#focused-and-to-the-point), all writing on this site strives for a high degree of focus and clarity (i.e., the higher level versions aren't overly verbose to begin with), but it is nonetheless true that the lower level versions of pages are even further reduced in length.

Given the people groups that the lower level pages are targeting, this is generally a very good thing. Children only have so much attention, for example, and people for whom English is a second (or third, etc.) language will greatly appreciate having less content overall to wade through.

#### Writing level and Bible versions used in quotations

The Bible versions and translations used on this site [are discussed below](#bible-versions-and-translations-used-on-this-site). While you can read more about all this there (including much more of "the why"), I do use different Bible versions for the two different writing levels:

- The higher level versions tend to quote from the ESV (embedded STEP Bible windows) and NIV84 (plain quotes).
- The lower level versions tend to quote from the ESV (embedded STEP Bible windows) and NIrV (plain quotes).

#### What are the benefits of higher level writing?

The benefits of writing at a lower level are fairly straightforward: more people will be able to make use of the materials (including folks lacking substantial education, children, non-native English speakers, and so on). Even advanced people can make use of materials written at a lower level with simpler sentence structure, vocabulary, and so on. So why not only offer things at a lower level of writing and save the time of keeping up with two different versions for all the content? What does higher level writing get us?

Well, why stop here? Why should English (much less language in general) have multiple words with overlapping meaning? Why even bother with complex sentence structure when we could just use sentences with single independent clauses for everything? Why doesn't everyone just write to the lowest common denominator? After all, this would enable the most people to read and understand the writing.

Here's a couple reasons:

* Higher level writing allows for more specificity, nuance, and subtlety in communication (as mediated by rich vocabulary usage, for example). This is why you will *never* find academic papers written at a low level -- because you "gain communicative power" (in a manner of speaking) from writing at a higher level, as long as your readers have enough education to keep up.
* For people that can handle it, higher level writing is much more engaging and much less boring to read.

This second one is very important. When people's mental faculties are being stretched, they have better directional attention; the important bit is not *over*-stretching one's capabilities. People lacking substantial education, children, and non-native English speakers will have a noticeably lower reading level than an American college graduate at the top of their class, for example. While the former groups of people might need to squint in concentration in reading lower level writing (their minds busy processing more foundational things like sentence structure and parts of speech -- especially for non-native English speakers), lower level writing presents little novelty and diversity for well-educated people with a higher reading level. It holds their attention less well than writing with more stylisic variation and rich vocabulary, in other words, and this is an actual problem.

#### Why only two levels, and not more?

Short answer: because maintaining multiple versions of the content takes a lot of time, and the marginal benefit of any additional writing levels after the first two is not worth this time opportunity cost.

Arguably, it might be nice to have higher level writing without technical explanation (instead glossing over the details) and/or lower level writing with technical explanation written at the same lower level (simpler sentence structure, more restrained vocabulary usage, etc.). The reason why these options don't exist is because they aren't nearly as likely to be relevant as the two permutations that are actually used: the people likely to be interested in technical discussion are probably going to have enough education to be able to handle the higher level of writing, and the people reading the lower level of writing probably aren't going to care about technical minutiae.

If time were no factor then I *would* offer even more levels. But time is a factor, so I don't.

#### At which writing level should I read?

There is not really a pat answer to this question, although most people with any degree of higher education should be able to handle the higher level writing on this site without too much trouble. Additionally, if you know you want to get into the nitty-gritty technical details, those only show up in the higher level writing (although all technical discussion is marked out in [special content sections](#special-content-sections) so is easy to avoid if you aren't interested in it).

While I would tend to steer people without any higher education towards the lower level writing so that dense prose doesn't get in the way of the Bible teaching for them, some of these folks will be just fine reading the higher level writing -- after all, formal education is not everything. The same can be said of children -- some kids read far above the level generally expected of them. Kids learn fast anyhow.

The only real hard recommendation I can make is that non-native English speakers stick with the lower writing level until they are quite confident of their ability. English is a very difficult foreign language to pick up because of its large vocabulary and lack of predictability/consistency.

Just as with [figuring out what content level(s) to focus on](#what-content-level-s-should-i-focus-on), personal experimentation is a good idea.
