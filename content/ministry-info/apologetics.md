   Apologetics revolves around defending the truth from challenges. Unlike evangelism which deals with giving the gospel to receptive audiences and teaching which deals with explaining the truth to receptive audiences, one's conversation partners in apologetics may be somewhat less friendly towards the truth. Knowing how to stand up for the truth without falling prey to pearls before swine requires a careful touch, not to mention a special gifting and sufficient preparation. This page describes apologetics ministries at a high level, preparing for apologetics ministries, and executing apologetics ministries.
