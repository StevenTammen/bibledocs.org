   After believing in the gospel and thus becoming saved, Christians have before them the task of learning all the truth contained in the Bible, God's Word given to man, the very Mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). Fortunately, God has set in place people in the Body to assist in this learning process by mining truth from the Bible, organizing it, and then communicating it through various means to those under their care. Teachers fulfill a critical role in the Church, and have a correspondingly high level of authority (although said authority needs to be exercised wisely). This page describes teaching ministries at a high level, preparing for teaching ministries, and executing teaching ministries.
