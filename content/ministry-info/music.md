   While the specifics have changed across times and places throughout history, music has played a role in Jewish (and later, Christian) religious practice right from the beginning (just look at the Psalms). Regrettably, despite there being nothing inherently wrong with music, it has in some assemblies come to overshadow the Word of God itself in importance. The question thus becomes how can music be used in the proper way? This page describes music-related ministries at a high level, preparing for music-related ministries, and executing music-related ministries.
