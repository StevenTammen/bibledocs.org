   TODO: Give a meaningful summary of the developments in 2023, as things play out. Hopefully, this year we'll get Bible studies at the house church off the ground, and build the beginnings of a stable local community. At least that is what we have been praying for.

### Summary {#through-1-1-23-summary}

This cycle I spent time relaxing over the holidays with family. I also made a good bit of progress on several various upcoming studies, although I didn't finish any of these enough to publish anything. There were also several things accomplished on the practical front, like building the standing desk that will serve as a speaking podium when used out in the living room during Bible studies at the house.

### Content {#through-1-1-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### Relaxing with family {#through-1-1-23-relaxing-with-family}

Not much to say here. I took time off work and spent the holidays visiting family and recharging.

<!-- --- -->

#### Progress on various studies {#through-1-1-23-progress-on-various-studies}

I am in the middle of drafting a study discussing the exact nature of "judge not" when properly interpreted (cf. Matthew 7:1ff).

I started that one when I was partway through a different study outlining some issues in the modern church visible (such as a lack of emphasis put on serious Bible teaching, as compared to music and social time, for example), and the lack of commitment many self-professed Christians demonstrate, given the amount of time they spend watching TV shows and browsing social media (and so on) rather than reading their Bibles or taking in Bible teaching. These are not fun things to talk about, but are necessary, for a lot of modern churchgoers seem to be blind to the sad decline of care people have towards the Bible and God's truth.

<!-- --- -->

I branched off into the other study about judging after I realized it might be a good idea to firmly establish that "shooting it straight" and "calling a spade a spade" is not something to be shy about for us as Christians. That is, pointing out unpleasant truths in a level-handed manner to lovingly exhort people to turn (more) toward the truth is not the sort of self-righteous condemnatory judgment called out in Matthew 7:1ff.

At any rate, exactly what I mean by all of these things will be more clear as I finish and publish all these studies.

<!-- --- -->

#### Practical matters {#through-1-1-23-practical-matters}

- I built the standing desk and angled dual monitor assembly that will serve as the speaking podium during Bible study presentations at the house. The desk had a lot of pieces, so took a while to build.
- I also built custom foam backings for the projector screens to make them straight and flush with the wall, to improve the projected images' centering.
- I sequenced my really big TODO list when I had the time over this holiday break. I have literally hundreds of things on this master list (including a good bit on the ministry side, of course), but as ever, it will always only be one step at a time.

<!-- --- -->

#### Upcoming work {#through-1-1-23-upcoming-work}

- Continuing to work on all the studies I mentioned.
- Hopefully I'll soon start to get involved in local fellowships.

### Summary {#through-1-15-23-summary}

This cycle was very research-heavy. I worked more on the studies I'm in the process of drafting, and in the process of researching a related topic, kicked off a massive forum discussion, and an email chain with my mentor. I also researched options for local fellowships, and narrowed down the options to several that look promising.

### Content {#through-1-15-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### Worked more on in-progress studies {#through-1-15-23-worked-more-on-in-progress-studies}

The same ones mentioned last cycle, about how Christians ought to view judging, and issues in the modern church.

I just don't want to release anything before I feel like things are ready. I've written more now, and split things into several parts, but still don't want to release the earlier parts until I'm sure I know the full order of the topics in the studies and won't change anything around any more.

<!-- --- -->

#### Researched a couple topics and had long conversations about them {#through-1-15-23-researched-a-couple-topics-and-had-long-conversations-about-them}

This was probably the biggest time sink this cycle. We had a very active topic on the forum. Across the four people participating, this topic spanned ~85 posts and ~130 pages single-spaced (were you to print it out).

I emailed my mentor about some of the things being discussed as well, and that email chain got up to ~13 responses long too.

<!-- --- -->

#### Researched and decided where I want to start getting involved locally {#through-1-15-23-researched-and-decided-where-i-want-to-start-getting-involved-locally}

I made a spreadsheet of many local churches (tens of them), came up with some criteria, and narrowed it down to several options.

I'm hoping to start getting involved in the next week or two.

<!-- --- -->

#### Upcoming work {#through-1-15-23-upcoming-work}

- Continuing to work on the studies I mentioned.
- Getting involved in local fellowships.

### Summary {#through-2-21-23-summary}

This cycle ran long on account of me being busy getting set up and established at some local church fellowships. That said, I got 16 (!) new content pages up on the site, making this the biggest content release since the beginning of this ministry. I'll see if I can keep up the pace as we move forward into the future. Prayers appreciated!

### Content {#through-2-21-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### Making these updates only as more content accumulates {#through-2-21-23-making-these-updates-only-as-more-content-accumulates}

For the first while here, I had been making these ministry updates every two weeks. The last couple dragged a bit, as I hadn't at that time had enough new content to really make them particularly interesting.

On that account, I decided to only make these once I have enough content accumulate for me to be able to do interesting updates. In principle, now that I'm truly entering production mode, this will probably end up back at right around every two weeks again (making this ~5 week gap an anomaly).

The reason why this latest update has been so slow in coming was because I was busy getting involved with some local fellowships, and then fleshing out the framework for me to write content relating to said fellowships. More on that later in the update.

I'm also going to try to make the progress update emails and posts on social media a bit less formulaic. Hopefully switching things up here and there will make it more engaging.

<!-- --- -->

#### Squashed some bugs/made some framework improvements {#through-2-21-23-squashed-some-bugs-made-some-framework-improvements}

- Updated z-index of TOC sidebar to ensure that footnotes display over it, whenever applicable.
- Fixed a bug on [this page](https://www.bibledocs.org/questions-and-answers/self-generated/on-the-office-of-pastor-teacher-and-church-polity/additional-clarification-and-other-offices-in-the-church/). I had previously named the headers for the five subquestions and subanswers the same thing, causing the scrollspy behavior in the TOC to behave strangely.
- Fixed a bug in the preprocessor application wherein links in the subject index were getting added twice/duplicated: once for a discussion page itself (as is proper), and a second time when the discussion page got aggregated onto a content page (which is not proper).
- Fixed a bug in the preprocessor application related to studies that only have a single page, rather than a series of pages. I added conditionals and such throughout the processing to make it so that such single-page studies are properly processed too.
- Fixed an issue where Step Bible App iframes were causing the parent page to jump all over the place as they loaded, probably due to an update upstream of me with their API. I added some delay before they are shown, to let them fully load and do their worst in the way of scroll-stealing before I make them visible. This seems to have fixed it quite nicely.
- Changed the styling of scripture-related special content sections. I made them transparent (as opposed to the light brown they had been), but added a 1px solid black border. I think the new style looks quite nice.

#### Got established at some local church fellowships {#through-2-21-23-got-established-at-some-local-church-fellowships}

I've started going to a Sunday school class on Sunday mornings, as well as a Bible study on Wednesday nights.

As I get more involved, a good bit of my production will probably shift into things relating to these groups, at least for the time being.

<!-- --- -->

#### New content {#through-2-21-23-new-content}

There is quite a lot this time (a full 16 new pages, to my count!), so we'll go through it bit by bit.

The study that the Sunday school class I've been attending has been going through is about how to discern the voice of God. In the Wednesday night Bible study, we are in Jeremiah at the moment.

I haven't started any writing of my own for the Jeremiah study yet, but plan to this week. I have, however written quite a lot relating to the Sunday school study.
