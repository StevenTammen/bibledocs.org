   TODO: Give a meaningful summary of the developments in 2023, as things play out. Hopefully, this year we'll get Bible studies at the house church off the ground, and build the beginnings of a stable local community. At least that is what we have been praying for.

### Summary {#through-1-1-23-summary}

This cycle I spent time relaxing over the holidays with family. I also made a good bit of progress on several various upcoming studies, although I didn't finish any of these enough to publish anything. There were also several things accomplished on the practical front, like building the standing desk that will serve as a speaking podium when used out in the living room during Bible studies at the house.

### Content {#through-1-1-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### Relaxing with family {#through-1-1-23-relaxing-with-family}

Not much to say here. I took time off work and spent the holidays visiting family and recharging.

<!-- --- -->

#### Progress on various studies {#through-1-1-23-progress-on-various-studies}

I am in the middle of drafting a study discussing the exact nature of "judge not" when properly interpreted (cf. Matthew 7:1ff).

I started that one when I was partway through a different study outlining some issues in the modern church visible (such as a lack of emphasis put on serious Bible teaching, as compared to music and social time, for example), and the lack of commitment many self-professed Christians demonstrate, given the amount of time they spend watching TV shows and browsing social media (and so on) rather than reading their Bibles or taking in Bible teaching. These are not fun things to talk about, but are necessary, for a lot of modern churchgoers seem to be blind to the sad decline of care people have towards the Bible and God's truth.

<!-- --- -->

I branched off into the other study about judging after I realized it might be a good idea to firmly establish that "shooting it straight" and "calling a spade a spade" is not something to be shy about for us as Christians. That is, pointing out unpleasant truths in a level-handed manner to lovingly exhort people to turn (more) toward the truth is not the sort of self-righteous condemnatory judgment called out in Matthew 7:1ff.

At any rate, exactly what I mean by all of these things will be more clear as I finish and publish all these studies.

<!-- --- -->

#### Practical matters {#through-1-1-23-practical-matters}

- I built the standing desk and angled dual monitor assembly that will serve as the speaking podium during Bible study presentations at the house. The desk had a lot of pieces, so took a while to build.
- I also built custom foam backings for the projector screens to make them straight and flush with the wall, to improve the projected images' centering.
- I sequenced my really big TODO list when I had the time over this holiday break. I have literally hundreds of things on this master list (including a good bit on the ministry side, of course), but as ever, it will always only be one step at a time.

<!-- --- -->

#### Upcoming work {#through-1-1-23-upcoming-work}

- Continuing to work on all the studies I mentioned.
- Hopefully I'll soon start to get involved in local fellowships.

### Summary {#through-1-15-23-summary}

This cycle was very research-heavy. I worked more on the studies I'm in the process of drafting, and in the process of researching a related topic, kicked off a massive forum discussion, and an email chain with my mentor. I also researched options for local fellowships, and narrowed down the options to several that look promising.

### Content {#through-1-15-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### Worked more on in-progress studies {#through-1-15-23-worked-more-on-in-progress-studies}

The same ones mentioned last cycle, about how Christians ought to view judging, and issues in the modern church.

I just don't want to release anything before I feel like things are ready. I've written more now, and split things into several parts, but still don't want to release the earlier parts until I'm sure I know the full order of the topics in the studies and won't change anything around any more.

<!-- --- -->

#### Researched a couple topics and had long conversations about them {#through-1-15-23-researched-a-couple-topics-and-had-long-conversations-about-them}

This was probably the biggest time sink this cycle. We had a very active topic on the forum. Across the four people participating, this topic spanned ~85 posts and ~130 pages single-spaced (were you to print it out).

I emailed my mentor about some of the things being discussed as well, and that email chain got up to ~13 responses long too.

<!-- --- -->

#### Researched and decided where I want to start getting involved locally {#through-1-15-23-researched-and-decided-where-i-want-to-start-getting-involved-locally}

I made a spreadsheet of many local churches (tens of them), came up with some criteria, and narrowed it down to several options.

I'm hoping to start getting involved in the next week or two.

<!-- --- -->

#### Upcoming work {#through-1-15-23-upcoming-work}

- Continuing to work on the studies I mentioned.

### Summary {#through-2-21-23-summary}

This cycle ran long on account of me being busy getting set up and established at some local church fellowships. That said, I got 16 (!) new content pages up on the site, making this the biggest content release since the beginning of this ministry. I'll see if I can keep up the pace as we move forward into the future. Prayers appreciated!

### Content {#through-2-21-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### Making these updates only as more content accumulates {#through-2-21-23-making-these-updates-only-as-more-content-accumulates}

For the first while here, I had been making these ministry updates every two weeks. The last couple dragged a bit, as I hadn't at that time had enough new content to really make them particularly interesting.

On that account, I decided to only make these once I have enough content accumulate for me to be able to do interesting updates. In principle, now that I'm truly entering production mode, this will probably end up back at right around every two weeks again (making this ~5 week gap an anomaly).

The reason why this latest update has been so slow in coming was because I was busy getting involved with some local fellowships, and then fleshing out the framework for me to write content relating to said fellowships. More on that later in the update.

I'm also going to try to make the progress update emails and posts on social media a bit less formulaic. Hopefully switching things up here and there will make it more engaging.

<!-- --- -->

#### Squashed some bugs/made some framework improvements {#through-2-21-23-squashed-some-bugs-made-some-framework-improvements}

- Updated z-index of TOC sidebar to ensure that footnotes display over it, whenever applicable.
- Fixed a bug on [this page](https://www.bibledocs.org/questions-and-answers/self-generated/on-the-office-of-pastor-teacher-and-church-polity/additional-clarification-and-other-offices-in-the-church/). I had previously named the headers for the five subquestions and subanswers the same thing, causing the scrollspy behavior in the TOC to behave strangely.
- Fixed a bug in the preprocessor application wherein links in the subject index were getting added twice/duplicated: once for a discussion page itself (as is proper), and a second time when the discussion page got aggregated onto a content page (which is not proper).
- Fixed a bug in the preprocessor application related to studies that only have a single page, rather than a series of pages. I added conditionals and such throughout the processing to make it so that such single-page studies are properly processed too.
- Fixed an issue where Step Bible App iframes were causing the parent page to jump all over the place as they loaded, probably due to an update upstream of me with their API. I added some delay before they are shown, to let them fully load and do their worst in the way of scroll-stealing before I make them visible. This seems to have fixed it quite nicely.
- Changed the styling of scripture-related special content sections. I made them transparent (as opposed to the light brown they had been), but added a 1px solid black border. I think the new style looks quite nice.

<!-- --- -->

#### Got established at some local church fellowships {#through-2-21-23-got-established-at-some-local-church-fellowships}

I've started going to a Sunday school class on Sunday mornings, as well as a Bible study on Wednesday nights.

As I get more involved, a good bit of my production will probably shift into things relating to these groups, at least for the time being.

<!-- --- -->

#### New content {#through-2-21-23-new-content}

There is quite a lot this time (a full 16 new pages, to my count!), so we'll go through it bit by bit.

The study that the Sunday school class I've been attending has been going through is about how to discern the voice of God. In the Wednesday night Bible study, we are in Jeremiah at the moment.

I haven't started any writing of my own for the Jeremiah study yet, but plan to this week. I have, however written quite a lot relating to the Sunday school study.

### Summary {#through-4-17-23-summary}

Due to various circumstances, I haven't gotten as much done (as quickly) as I might have liked in the last little bit. I'm helping a close friend get content ready for his own ministry website, which has taken up a good bit of my time. I also moved into a new role at work, which had somewhat of a learning curve, and was very busy when sent on a business trip for two weeks. There were other things too, but you get the idea.

Nonetheless, this release brings some new content for many of the lessons in the Winter series from our Sunday School class at Central Baptist, relating to discerning the voice of God.

### Content {#through-4-17-23-content}

<!-- --- -->

#### It's been a while... {#through-4-17-23-it-s-been-a-while}

Even though last time I said I'd try to keep up the production pace, well... it's not that this release brings nothing, but it is less than I'd anticipated, and later than anticipated too.

I'll go over a brief summary of some of the reasons for that at the end of this update. That way people who aren't interested in hearing the details won't have to (you can just stop watching when that part starts).

<!-- --- -->

#### Helping my roommate get his content ready for his ministry launch {#through-4-17-23-helping-my-roommate-get-his-content-ready-for-his-ministry-launch}

Partway through this cycle I started helping my roommate get all his written content ready for the launching of his own online ministry. There's a lot more of it than I'd realized! Which is a very good thing, to be clear.

I'm helping organize it all, and add additional headers for better section linkability, and things like that. I hadn't really anticipated the degree of time this is requiring of me, but it will very much be worth it in the end, once all his stuff goes up. It's just that in the meantime, a good bit of my time is going here, rather than my own content.

<!-- --- -->

#### New content this cycle {#through-4-17-23-new-content-this-cycle}

That said, I still got a number of new things up in this cycle. I have several more things that are decidedly close to being done too, but I decided I'd procrastinated too long already on a progress update, as I kept moving the goalposts forward. So these others can wait until next time. The list for this time:

<!-- --- -->

#### Upcoming work {#through-4-17-23-upcoming-work}

- I'll be trying to mostly focus on finishing helping my roommate with his content for the next little bit. The sooner I can can finish helping with that, the sooner I can stop having to split my focus. This may take a while though, so I think it may be a few weeks until I get another update of my own up, since I'll be tied up with this.
- Aside from that, I'm going to try to at least finish the other things I am close on. I might be able to get these things up sooner than other new content.

#### Excuse for lateness number 1: Microphone debugging {#through-4-17-23-excuse-for-lateness-number-1-microphone-debugging}

The volume level for recordings has been ending up really quiet (when recording through the wireless microphone I've been using -- the Rode Wireless Go II), and I haven't been happy with the audio quality when I run the quiet audio through audio normalization (even though I did just that for several past videos).

I spent time trying to figure out how to get louder audio when recording, and also figure out why my gain settings were not seeming to be respected when recording. One YouTube video claims that to have adjustable gain with this wireless Rode system, one needs to use an audio cable (3.5mm jack) not USB-C to connect the receiver into a computer, for whatever reason. I have things on order to test this out, and am hopeful, but as of now, still no dice.

<!-- --- -->

#### Excuse for lateness number 2: Getting accustomed to new responsibilities at work {#through-4-17-23-excuse-for-lateness-number-2-getting-accustomed-to-new-responsibilities-at-work}

In my day job as a software engineer, I'm formally shifting into project management, helping our primary PM with her large set of responsibilities. My focus is going to be mostly on the technical requirements side of that set of responsibilities. It's more or less a promotion, and in accordance with that, I'll be getting more responsibility and pressure in some ways (e.g., the number of people whom I am helping sequence work for has tripled from ~6 to ~18). On top of that, this first little bit has had somewhat of a learning curve, as expected for new duties.

Up until this shift in responsibilities, I had been leading an Agile software development subteam as a team lead. Now I am more or less moving into doing requirements refinement and work sequencing full time (in addition to leading my subteam just as I always have). Due to only having so much time in a workday, I'm more or less stepping back from coding myself now. (I'd already been less than full-time coding for some time, instead shouldering other responsibilities in the division of labor. This is just going the complete distance and severing any expectations for me there, instead formally tasking me for more of the PM workload).

#### Excuse for lateness number 3: I was very busy when away on a business trip for two weeks {#through-4-17-23-excuse-for-lateness-number-3-i-was-very-busy-when-away-on-a-business-trip-for-two-weeks}

Soon after I got my new set of PM-related responsibilities, I drove 10 hours up to Ohio to participate in two weeks of meetings with our project's customers. This sucked up a lot of time, because:

- I made the drive (~10 hours one-way) both there and back on weekend days. I'll get the time back later as travel comp time, but it still kind of nuked two weekends in this cycle specifically. This put a damper on ministry stuff since weekends are usually when I have the most free time and therefore tend to get the most ministry stuff done.
  - Also, the weekend in between the two traveling weekends -- the one when I was up in Ohio -- I was visiting with a friend who lives in Columbus most of Saturday, so didn't get much work done that weekend either.
- I was tired after every workday on this trip since we had days of ~7 hour meetings for two weeks straight.
- I also pulled a lot more overtime than I normally do (probably over 15 hours across the two weeks) to try and get more written down when it was all fresh in my mind.

#### Excuse for lateness number 4: I spent some time "investing in the future" {#through-4-17-23-excuse-for-lateness-number-4-i-spent-some-time-investing-in-the-future}

I spent a good bit of time on what I would term "investing in the future." I installed keycaps and such on my custom mechanical keyboard that came in the mail, and worked on the AutoHotkey script to do keyboard remapping, so I can start touch typing full time, which should help boost content production speeds.

I also spent a lot of time considering my teleprompter and video processing workflows to see if I could possibly further automate content production. I have some good ideas now, but more programming/software development work will be needed to get there, unfortunately. This may be what I focus on next, after I help my roommate launch his ministry website. I think it will be necessary before I can start consistently putting out videos with the throughput, quality, and functionality I wish to have all at the same time.

There were some other matters too, but those were a couple of the bigger things in this area.
