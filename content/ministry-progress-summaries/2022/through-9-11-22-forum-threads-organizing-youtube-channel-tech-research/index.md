## Summary {#summary}

This first summary video here, I go over all of the things that happened in the first couple weeks since ministry launch. Even though we had a three-day weekend in here, I got really caught up in a forum conversation, and didn't perhaps make as much forward progress as I had initially thought I might. I also spent a lot of time researching various things relating to technology to hopefully make future video content better for this ministry. But, nonetheless, I did get a number of things done, especially in terms of organizing the YouTube channel more.

### Emailing back people who responded to ministry launch email {#emailing-back-people-who-responded-to-ministry-launch-email}

Thanks to all who took the time to reach out after launch. I got to have a couple conversations with people I hadn't talked to in a while, and it really made my day.

Even for everyone else who didn't reach out but still subscribed to the YouTube channel and signed up for the mailing list and such -- thanks for all your support too!

For anyone curious, from around ~75 people BCC'd on initial launch (many folks I've known from college and such), the ministry has gained about 5 YouTube subscribers, and about 6 people on the mailing list.

But hey, starting small is no big deal. I'm not doing it for fame or money, after all.

<!-- --- -->

### A debate on the forum about matters concerning submitting to government authority, and what exactly that means {#a-debate-on-the-forum-about-matters-concerning-submitting-to-government-authority-and-what-exactly-that-means}

The timing wasn't the best considering I'd just launched, but a good friend and I had an extremely active debate going on on the forum for the span of a few days in this cycle. I spent a lot of my time outside of my 9-5 job there, including most of the three day weekend over labor day.

<!-- --- -->

A brief outline:

- Initial WhatsApp conversation
- Compiling that into a PDF. (~50 pages)
- Compiling the conversation I'd had with my mentor about the same topics
- Starting related threads on the forum (referencing the above compilations)
- Lots of responding to the threads (both of them)
- Eventually, a voice chat to iron things out better, since there are some limitations to understanding tone and intent and such over text alone. Hurray for WhatsApp and VoIP. This helped more than much of the text we'd sent back-and-forth over the days.

At the end of it all, we had on the order of 70 responses across both threads, and well over 100 pages of conversation, I'm sure, were we to print it all out.

But it was good. A worthy use of time. (Although of course we've learned some things from the experience, and hope to communicate better in the future. At least I sure do).

<!-- --- -->

Just another plug for anyone interested to sign up for the community (forum and WhatsApp group). The registration form is [here](https://www.bibledocs.org/community-overview/#the-form-itself) on the site.

If the scope of that conversation I just went over sounds super-intimidating, don't worry, that's just me and my friend in the section set off for us to go chat things out whenever we start getting technical.

Most of the forum isn't that over-the-top! I promise.

<!-- --- -->

### Discussion about forum structure moving forward {#discussion-about-forum-structure-moving-forward}

I won't put everyone to sleep by spending much time here, but now that I formally launched, I had some necessary conversations with folks about exactly what that means for the forum I've been sysadmin-ing for several years, and what it will mean moving forward.

A couple of my close friends will probably get their own Bible teaching endeavors off the ground pretty soon too, and we needed to chat a bit to figure out what that means, regarding our community and how we interact there.

Specifically, we will all teach as we feel led by the Lord, and it is right and proper for us to be independent, but what happens when you put us all in the same place?

As I say, practical admin stuff.

<!-- --- -->

### Helping my good friend start setting up a ministry website of his own {#helping-my-good-friend-start-setting-up-a-ministry-website-of-his-own}

He'd already converted all of his content into markdown, but we spent a couple hours getting the local webserver and template/theme set up on his computer, so he can see what everything looks like as a website.

I had to rework some of the templating for him since he is laying his content out differently from me. Before we do things for real (actually deploy his site), I'll need to make my theme up on GitHub much more extensible (refactor to use SCSS variables for colors, for example), but that will come in time. Right now this was sort of the quick-and-dirty first pass, to get things scaffolded out for him in the meantime, so he can test everything.

<!-- --- -->

### Researching/buying technology of various forms, things that will help future content {#researching-buying-technology-of-various-forms-things-that-will-help-future-content}

First of all, I ordered a new desktop computer to help smooth everything out in the workflow by means of lots more power (it should be here in a few days). This has been a long time in coming, since the Surface Pro tablet I've been using since mid-college is getting pretty long-in-the-tooth at this point.

I'd already been meaning to get a more powerful desktop computer to help with the video processing, but the straw that broke the camel's back here was realizing I'd need more computational power to optimally make use of voice recognition software in drafting video scripts, which is something I'll get to in a sec.

<!-- --- -->

Now, aside from juicing up my processing power in preparation for really ramping up the video production, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how to best create the video content itself.

While I thought I had a reasonably good idea of how I wanted to actually make the videos, the creation of the initial ministry overview video caused me to rethink some things.

Specifically, I decided:

1. Being tethered with a wired lapel mic is not cool. I'd like wireless, even if it's more expensive.
2. Being unable to directly read scripts when making videos will inherently lead to lower quality than being able to directly (naturally) read them with a teleprompter. It's a bigger deal than I'd realized.
3. Scripts for videos of any length are an awful lot longer than you might think -- thousands of words. If I wish to improve the video quality with formal scripts, I'm going to need to step up my game in the text-input department, a lot. Otherwise it simply takes way too long to write full scripts.

<!-- --- -->

So, in preparation to tackle these three areas, I did a bunch of research and settled on:

1. [A wireless GoPro-compatible mic from Rode](https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelessgoii)
2. [A teleprompter setup that works with GoPros too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXZhksmmIYs)
3. [Voice recognition software](https://www.nuance.com/dragon/business-solutions/dragon-professional-individual.html) from a company called Nuance to start dictating transcripts at speeds hopefully exceeding 200 words per minute.

I haven't purchased these things yet, but probably will soon, after the new computer comes and I get it it set up. We are probably still a few weeks out from scaled-up video production, but I am building out the framework right now to be able to have a high throughput in the long-term. At least that is my hope.

<!-- --- -->

### Doing everything to be able to resume the SR4 video series, when the time is right {#doing-everything-to-be-able-to-resume-the-sr4-video-series-when-the-time-is-right}

I had a document mapping out all the remaining content in the section from the study I have yet to cover. But I couldn't find it!

So I spent a looong time looking for it, and finally found it. Then I verified it was in the right state (the last things I'd removed from it were the slides for the last presentation video I did). So I can now resume that series again right from where I left off, whenever I decide I am ready to pick back up in video production.

<!-- --- -->

### Planning out BB6A content grouping {#planning-out-bb6a-content-grouping}

I watched all the way through what had been weeks 53, 54, and 55, where I had intentionally taught through all the points upfront before any discussion.

I also skimmed through the rest of the videos in the series. I decided that I wouldn't be doing any editing of them to focus them more. Not worth it, time-wise.

All of these will be split out into a separate playlist from the earlier videos in our BB6A playlist, as these are much more organized and focused, and will probably be much more useful to people overall.

<!-- --- -->

### Organizing the YouTube channel better {#organizing-the-youtube-channel-better}

SR4 series

- Organize already-existing full playlist for SR4 series
- Make no discussion video playlist for SR4 series

BB6A series

- Organize already-existing full playlist for BB6A series
- Make focused/organized playlist for BB6A series

Both

- Created custom thumbnails for each series, and added them to all the videos (around 115 videos total, at this point)
- Removed numbers from all the more-focused videos, to leave just video subjects in the titles, which is more natural.

<!-- --- -->

### Asking a nearby school about parking policy and grounds use after-hours {#asking-a-nearby-school-about-parking-policy-and-grounds-use-after-hours}

Just as it sounds. Will be relevant for potentially improving the parking situation for the in-person side of Bible studies, eventually. Still no response, unfortunately.

<!-- --- -->

### Upcoming work {#upcoming-work}

One immediate focus will be finishing off the initial organization of already-existing content on the YouTube channel (the ~115 videos or so that are already there, about 60 of which are more organized and focused). In that vein, I'm planning on making a few more initial videos:

- Introduction videos for all the playlists
- A second channel intro video that is much, much shorter, with timestamped links to the full treatment. Since 45 minutes for an intro video is much longer than I'd initially wanted.

<!-- --- -->

I will also start filling in all of the things for the existing content (timestamps, summaries, the content on the study webpages on the website itself), as I still have a lot of catching up to do.

Finally, I'm planning to keep researching all that I need to do to finish preparing for the video creation workflow. There's still lots to be done here (at least to get it up to my ever-increasing standards), but I am very hopeful the wait will be worth it, in terms of the quality the preparation should eventually yield.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=107">1:47</a> - uh the planning document that i had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=109">1:49</a> - lost track of for that series i planned<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=112">1:52</a> - out a bunch of the bible basics 6a<br/>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=117">1:57</a> - so that is the bible study that we had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=120">2:00</a> - in a shared group sense we have about 90<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=122">2:02</a> - somewhat videos up in that series and i<br/>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=126">2:06</a> - organized a whole bunch of stuff on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=127">2:07</a> - youtube channel better i sent a question<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=130">2:10</a> - to a nearby school about parking and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=132">2:12</a> - this is hopefully in line with the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=133">2:13</a> - in-person bible study that we'll pick up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=135">2:15</a> - here eventually and then i'm going to go<br/>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=208">3:28</a> - not in this to make a big name for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=210">3:30</a> - ourselves or anything like that so uh i<br/>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=220">3:40</a> - people did and so that at least makes me<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=222">3:42</a> - feel somewhat validated all right so now<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=224">3:44</a> - we're going to talk about the debate on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=226">3:46</a> - the forum about matters concerning<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=227">3:47</a> - submitting to government authority and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=229">3:49</a> - what exactly that means for us as<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=230">3:50</a> - christians so the timing wasn't really<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=232">3:52</a> - the best here considering i basically<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=234">3:54</a> - just launched when we got really into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=235">3:55</a> - this so a very good friend of mine and i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=238">3:58</a> - had an extremely active debate going on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=241">4:01</a> - the forum<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=242">4:02</a> - probably for the span of probably five<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=244">4:04</a> - days or so uh five or six days in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=246">4:06</a> - midst of this two-week cycle here and i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=248">4:08</a> - spent a lot of my time outside of my uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=251">4:11</a> - my normal nine-to-five job i kind of on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=253">4:13</a> - the forum on these threads um including<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=255">4:15</a> - most of the three day weekend over labor<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=257">4:17</a> - day so we had a monday off but i was<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=260">4:20</a> - pretty heavily enmeshed in this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=261">4:21</a> - conversation here so i didn't end up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=263">4:23</a> - getting a lot done on the ministry front<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=265">4:25</a> - there uh well but of course this is<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=267">4:27</a> - ministry in its own way so we were<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=268">4:28</a> - having a very long conversation about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=270">4:30</a> - the nature of this and the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=272">4:32</a> - interpretation of the verses involved<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=273">4:33</a> - and things like that and so here's just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=275">4:35</a> - a brief outline of what ended up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=277">4:37</a> - happening we had an initial whatsapp<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=279">4:39</a> - conversation that's kind of what sparked<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=280">4:40</a> - this i compiled that into a pdf so that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=282">4:42</a> - took some time cleaning up the whatsapp<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=284">4:44</a> - transcript so it's about 50 pages just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=286">4:46</a> - up front before we really even got into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=288">4:48</a> - the technical side of things here and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=290">4:50</a> - then i compiled a conversation i had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=292">4:52</a> - with a mentor about some of the same<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=293">4:53</a> - topics uh in this conversation you might<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=295">4:55</a> - ask them some questions based on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=297">4:57</a> - conversation we were having i started<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=299">4:59</a> - the threads on the forum referencing<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=301">5:01</a> - these compilations then there was lots<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=303">5:03</a> - of back and forth uh kind of each of us<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=305">5:05</a> - representing our own points of view and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=307">5:07</a> - of course towards the end here uh i had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=310">5:10</a> - us have a voice chat so i called my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=312">5:12</a> - friend on whatsapp and uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=314">5:14</a> - you know it ended up kind of working out<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=316">5:16</a> - better talking over voice maybe we ought<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=318">5:18</a> - to have done that sooner just because<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=319">5:19</a> - there's some limitations to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=321">5:21</a> - understanding tone and intent and such<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=323">5:23</a> - over text alone and you can kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=325">5:25</a> - better pick that up when you have a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=326">5:26</a> - conversation and so this helped kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=328">5:28</a> - iron things out a little bit better and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=329">5:29</a> - as i say maybe i'll learn the lesson<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=331">5:31</a> - here maybe we try to do that a little<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=333">5:33</a> - bit sooner next time but um you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=335">5:35</a> - nonetheless uh this was a debate about<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=337">5:37</a> - certain matters of interpretation here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=338">5:38</a> - so it was a very a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=340">5:40</a> - good process of iron sharpening iron and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=343">5:43</a> - us trying to get to the bottom of this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=345">5:45</a> - matter of the truth here so at the end<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=347">5:47</a> - of it all we had probably on the order<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=348">5:48</a> - of 70 responses on the forum threading<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=350">5:50</a> - and that's after the 50 pages of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=352">5:52</a> - whatsapp conversation we had and so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=354">5:54</a> - would say at the end of this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=355">5:55</a> - conversation well over 100 pages of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=358">5:58</a> - uh responses here and so it was good as<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=360">6:00</a> - i say a worthy use of time and with that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=363">6:03</a> - being said of course we did learn some<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=365">6:05</a> - things from this at least me especially<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=367">6:07</a> - you know in terms of how i communicated<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=368">6:08</a> - and uh basically not assuming things in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=370">6:10</a> - the other person's position and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=372">6:12</a> - communication styles and learning how to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=374">6:14</a> - present disagreements in a way that is<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=376">6:16</a> - less likely to be inflammatory things<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=378">6:18</a> - along those lines and of course we can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=380">6:20</a> - always do better in communication so uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=382">6:22</a> - trying to learn um so hopefully in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=384">6:24</a> - future we can have even more productive<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=386">6:26</a> - discussions um you know and kind of you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=388">6:28</a> - know have less misunderstanding before<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=390">6:30</a> - we finally get through to each other<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=391">6:31</a> - that sort of thing so a very good<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=393">6:33</a> - learning experience and of course lots<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=395">6:35</a> - of good interesting discussion on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=397">6:37</a> - particular matters here so having<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=399">6:39</a> - mentioned the forum here this is just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=400">6:40</a> - another plug for anyone who's interested<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=402">6:42</a> - there is a forum on the website i did go<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=404">6:44</a> - over this in the launch video although<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=405">6:45</a> - that was of course very long itself so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=407">6:47</a> - this registration page here on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=409">6:49</a> - sidebar you get here by going to the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=411">6:51</a> - community section clicking overview and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=413">6:53</a> - then from the overview it's actually the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=414">6:54</a> - very last thing the table of contents uh<br/>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=426">7:06</a> - most of the conversations on the forum<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=428">7:08</a> - are not entirely like the one that i'm<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=430">7:10</a> - talking about here my friend and i um<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=432">7:12</a> - have kind of a separate part of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=434">7:14</a> - forum where we get really technical into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=436">7:16</a> - stuff if we need to chat through<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=438">7:18</a> - something and uh most of the forum isn't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=440">7:20</a> - quite so over the top as us i promise<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=442">7:22</a> - now we are not the most concise of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=443">7:23</a> - people but there are plenty of other<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=446">7:26</a> - people on the forum<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=447">7:27</a> - who have more normal length<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=449">7:29</a> - conversations than the hundred pages<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=450">7:30</a> - about really complex theological debate<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=452">7:32</a> - but if you're interested in that well we<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=454">7:34</a> - have that too um so this was the forum<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=456">7:36</a> - debate as i say took up a good bit of my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=458">7:38</a> - time this particular cycle<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=461">7:41</a> - now we also kind of coming out of this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=463">7:43</a> - had a bit of just a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=465">7:45</a> - bit of discussion talking about the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=467">7:47</a> - forum structure moving forward so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=469">7:49</a> - won't really put everyone to sleep by<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=470">7:50</a> - spending too much time here but now that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=472">7:52</a> - i formally launched you know a couple<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=474">7:54</a> - weeks back here i had some necessary<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=476">7:56</a> - conversations with folks about exactly<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=478">7:58</a> - what that means for the forum so i've<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=479">7:59</a> - been the sysadmin of this forum for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=481">8:01</a> - about three years now and now that i've<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=483">8:03</a> - launched my own ministry it's kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=485">8:05</a> - being put under the umbrella of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=487">8:07</a> - ministry which it wasn't before um and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=489">8:09</a> - just a few changes related to that also<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=492">8:12</a> - a couple of my close friends here in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=494">8:14</a> - this community will probably get their<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=496">8:16</a> - own bible teaching endeavors off the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=497">8:17</a> - ground pretty soon as well so i just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=499">8:19</a> - launched here but they're not going to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=500">8:20</a> - be too far behind me and so given that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=502">8:22</a> - we just needed to chat a bit to figure<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=504">8:24</a> - out what that means kind of regarding<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=506">8:26</a> - the community and how we interact there<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=509">8:29</a> - so specifically we're all going to be<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=510">8:30</a> - teaching as we feel led by the lord<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=512">8:32</a> - right so we may not agree on absolutely<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=514">8:34</a> - all matters but you know we'll teach as<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=516">8:36</a> - we feel led and it is right and proper<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=518">8:38</a> - for us to be independent right we are<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=520">8:40</a> - not a monolith nor<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=522">8:42</a> - were we ever trying to force each other<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=523">8:43</a> - to be and so given this what happens<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=525">8:45</a> - when you put us all together in the same<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=527">8:47</a> - place we spent a little bit of time<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=528">8:48</a> - addressing this as it will soon be kind<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=530">8:50</a> - of a very relevant matter for us so kind<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=532">8:52</a> - of practical admin stuff not going to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=534">8:54</a> - spend too much time here but this is the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=535">8:55</a> - behind the scenes conversations to make<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=537">8:57</a> - sure everything functions smoothly on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=539">8:59</a> - the community so after this one of those<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=541">9:01</a> - friends that i just mentioned i was<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=543">9:03</a> - helping him<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=544">9:04</a> - start setting up a ministry website of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=545">9:05</a> - his own so i deploy my website using a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=548">9:08</a> - static site generator called hugo and uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=550">9:10</a> - because i'm helping him set up his site<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=552">9:12</a> - he's gonna be doing the same because<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=553">9:13</a> - that's what i know how to do um and so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=555">9:15</a> - he had already converted all of his<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=556">9:16</a> - content into markdown but we spent a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=558">9:18</a> - couple hours getting the local web<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=560">9:20</a> - server and the template and theme setup<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=561">9:21</a> - on his computer so he can see what<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=562">9:22</a> - everything looks like as a website so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=564">9:24</a> - previously he just been editing the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=566">9:26</a> - markdown files but now everything will<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=567">9:27</a> - come together on a local web server and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=569">9:29</a> - he can see what it all looks like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=571">9:31</a> - laid out in terms of a website and so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=573">9:33</a> - had to rework some of the templating for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=575">9:35</a> - him since his content is laid out a bit<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=577">9:37</a> - differently than mine is mine's actually<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=579">9:39</a> - a little bit more complicated more like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=580">9:40</a> - levels of nesting and stuff but uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=582">9:42</a> - before we do things for real for real so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=584">9:44</a> - like before we deploy his website push<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=586">9:46</a> - it out on the internet um i will<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=588">9:48</a> - probably want to clean up my theme on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=589">9:49</a> - github so that i can actually use it as<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=591">9:51</a> - a sub module proper i kind of just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=593">9:53</a> - overrode some changes kind of quick and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=596">9:56</a> - dirty here this was the first pass to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=598">9:58</a> - get things scaffolded for him in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=599">9:59</a> - meantime so he can kind of test<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=600">10:00</a> - everything locally but<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=602">10:02</a> - you know one example changes i'll<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=603">10:03</a> - probably<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=604">10:04</a> - uh switch to using scss rather than css<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=607">10:07</a> - that compiled form that lets you use<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=608">10:08</a> - variables for things uh so that it's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=610">10:10</a> - really easy to change the colors across<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=612">10:12</a> - the theme so for example for the sidebar<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=614">10:14</a> - menu you know like sidebar menu or the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=616">10:16</a> - table of contents here if you want to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=617">10:17</a> - change the background color for that you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=619">10:19</a> - can do that with a variable so that you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=621">10:21</a> - don't have to go hard-coding css<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=622">10:22</a> - everywhere so i'll need to think a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=624">10:24</a> - little bit more it's my first time<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=626">10:26</a> - actually making a website theme of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=627">10:27</a> - course and i would like to use it across<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=628">10:28</a> - all my sites as well but that's it to do<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=630">10:30</a> - to come later now another thing that got<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=633">10:33</a> - done during this period is i made a lot<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=635">10:35</a> - of research and uh i actually bought a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=638">10:38</a> - couple things relating to technology of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=640">10:40</a> - various forms things that will help<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=642">10:42</a> - future content so specifically future<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=644">10:44</a> - video content here so i actually ordered<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=646">10:46</a> - a new desktop computer here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=648">10:48</a> - and this is to help smooth everything<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=649">10:49</a> - out in the workflow<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=651">10:51</a> - and it will do that by just having a lot<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=653">10:53</a> - more processing power so more cpu power<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=656">10:56</a> - a lot more ram um i only had eight<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=657">10:57</a> - gigabytes here i've been running with a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=660">11:00</a> - surface pro tablet i've had for gosh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=662">11:02</a> - probably five or six years now maybe<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=663">11:03</a> - even longer since mid-college it's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=665">11:05</a> - getting pretty long in the tooth here so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=667">11:07</a> - it's actually served me quite well i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=668">11:08</a> - don't have any complaints with it it's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=669">11:09</a> - just now that i'm getting into some<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=671">11:11</a> - other things i do believe i need more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=673">11:13</a> - power so that's one of the reasons why i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=674">11:14</a> - got a desktop computer here but it will<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=676">11:16</a> - help with the video processing but<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=678">11:18</a> - actually the straw that broke the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=679">11:19</a> - camel's back here uh was realizing that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=681">11:21</a> - i need more computational power to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=684">11:24</a> - optimally make use of voice recognition<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=686">11:26</a> - software um and so specifically i'm<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=688">11:28</a> - going to be using that in drafting video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=689">11:29</a> - scripts which is something i'll get to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=691">11:31</a> - in a second but voice recognition<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=693">11:33</a> - software kind of heavy on the processing<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=694">11:34</a> - power as the computer tries to guess<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=697">11:37</a> - what it is you're saying convert that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=698">11:38</a> - into text and so i just knew that my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=700">11:40</a> - tablet was not going to be able to keep<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=702">11:42</a> - up if i had that and a text editor and a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=704">11:44</a> - browser and maybe a music player and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=706">11:46</a> - everything else all up at the same time<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=708">11:48</a> - i just didn't have a powerful enough<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=709">11:49</a> - computer for it and so i probably went a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=712">11:52</a> - bit far the other way bought a very<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=713">11:53</a> - powerful computer now but hopefully<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=715">11:55</a> - it'll leave me future proof for a good<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=716">11:56</a> - long time here and help me on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=718">11:58</a> - content generation front so that i can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=720">12:00</a> - edit videos as well and have plenty of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=722">12:02</a> - power for all of the content generation<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=724">12:04</a> - things that are coming in the pipeline<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=726">12:06</a> - here all right so not going to hopefully<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=728">12:08</a> - get too bogged down here but i also<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=731">12:11</a> - spent time aside from just researching<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=734">12:14</a> - you know that particular facet of this i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=736">12:16</a> - spent a lot of time thinking about how<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=738">12:18</a> - to best create the video content itself<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=740">12:20</a> - so i thought i'd had a pretty good idea<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=742">12:22</a> - of how i wanted to actually make the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=744">12:24</a> - videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=744">12:24</a> - but then i made the ministry overview<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=746">12:26</a> - video which i had written a pretty long<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=748">12:28</a> - script for but i did not have a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=750">12:30</a> - teleprompter or anything and i maybe<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=752">12:32</a> - rethink some things and so specifically<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=754">12:34</a> - three areas i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=755">12:35</a> - made decisions in things that i'd spent<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=757">12:37</a> - time thinking on i decided that being<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=759">12:39</a> - tethered with a wired lapel mic is not<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=761">12:41</a> - cool so i'm still recording the videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=763">12:43</a> - like that now i haven't actually<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=764">12:44</a> - purchased any replacements but it keeps<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=766">12:46</a> - me really tied to the webcam i can't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=769">12:49</a> - really move around that much<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=770">12:50</a> - and so i just decided that i'd like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=772">12:52</a> - wireless even if it's more expensive i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=774">12:54</a> - think it will be better experience for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=776">12:56</a> - me and uh kind of lead to more natural<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=778">12:58</a> - content i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=780">13:00</a> - am have decided as well that being<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=783">13:03</a> - unable to directly read scripts when<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=784">13:04</a> - making videos oh just will inherently<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=786">13:06</a> - lead to lower content quality so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=789">13:09</a> - consider myself a much better writer<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=790">13:10</a> - than i am a speaker and so if i'm able<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=793">13:13</a> - to directly kind of naturally read the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=795">13:15</a> - scripts with a teleprompter so that i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=796">13:16</a> - can look at the camera while i'm reading<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=798">13:18</a> - i just think that it will make the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=800">13:20</a> - content a lot better than it would<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=801">13:21</a> - otherwise be and it's a much bigger deal<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=803">13:23</a> - than i thought it might be um and then<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=805">13:25</a> - in writing a script for the ministry<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=808">13:28</a> - introduction video that i mentioned just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=810">13:30</a> - now i realized that scripts for videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=812">13:32</a> - of any length are actually an awful lot<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=814">13:34</a> - longer than you'd think so thousands and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=815">13:35</a> - thousands of words if i wish to improve<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=817">13:37</a> - the video quality with formal scripts<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=819">13:39</a> - like i just mentioned i'm going to need<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=821">13:41</a> - to step up my game in the text input<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=822">13:42</a> - department a lot otherwise it just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=824">13:44</a> - simply takes way too long to write full<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=826">13:46</a> - scripts for everything<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=828">13:48</a> - and so specifically to solve these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=830">13:50</a> - problems here's the ideas that i did<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=832">13:52</a> - research and came up with here there is<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=835">13:55</a> - a wireless<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=836">13:56</a> - gopro compatible mic from a company<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=838">13:58</a> - called road here i think they're a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=840">14:00</a> - company from europe not entirely sure<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=842">14:02</a> - but they have<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=843">14:03</a> - kind of an action camera mic here you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=845">14:05</a> - can plug it into the 3.5 millimeter jack<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=848">14:08</a> - and it's got um kind of a you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=850">14:10</a> - wireless receiver here you can plug a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=852">14:12</a> - lapel mic into so that's going to be the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=854">14:14</a> - microphone solution here there's a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=856">14:16</a> - teleprompter set up this is actually a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=858">14:18</a> - link to a youtube video that i found<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=859">14:19</a> - about a guy who explains how to use a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=861">14:21</a> - teleprompter setup now he actually uses<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=864">14:24</a> - like a custom cage for his gopro here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=867">14:27</a> - like this one this aluminum cage i'm<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=870">14:30</a> - probably just going to use a single ring<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=871">14:31</a> - you need some adapter for the 52<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=874">14:34</a> - millimeter like lens adapter so that you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=875">14:35</a> - can stick uh the teleprompter on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=878">14:38</a> - front of it and so uh here is the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=880">14:40</a> - specific teleprompter that i'm looking<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=882">14:42</a> - at it's from a company called the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=883">14:43</a> - padcaster pair it's really not that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=885">14:45</a> - expensive and it's pretty neat you use<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=887">14:47</a> - your phone here as the teleprompter and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=889">14:49</a> - then you can stick the gopro behind it<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=890">14:50</a> - so this is what i'm looking at here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=893">14:53</a> - and so that's the teleprompter hopefully<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=895">14:55</a> - that would help me read content in a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=897">14:57</a> - more natural way and then as to making<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=899">14:59</a> - the transcripts in a time efficient way<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=901">15:01</a> - i was started looking very seriously<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=902">15:02</a> - into voice recognition software so i'd<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=905">15:05</a> - done a lot of research instead into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=906">15:06</a> - stenography a few years back i was very<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=908">15:08</a> - interested in it conceptually but voice<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=910">15:10</a> - recognition software doesn't have nearly<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=912">15:12</a> - as big a learning curve and so there's a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=913">15:13</a> - company called nuance here that makes a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=915">15:15</a> - product called dragon<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=917">15:17</a> - dragon naturally speaking or dragon<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=919">15:19</a> - dictation it's a voice recognition<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=921">15:21</a> - software and i'm hoping that once i get<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=923">15:23</a> - the hang of it and i need to set some<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=924">15:24</a> - things up of course and it has a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=926">15:26</a> - learning curve of its own but that once<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=928">15:28</a> - i get the hang of it i'll be able to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=929">15:29</a> - start dictating transcripts for videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=931">15:31</a> - to the tune of 200 words or more per<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=934">15:34</a> - minute and so that will help of course<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=935">15:35</a> - because even when i touch type on my own<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=938">15:38</a> - keyboard layout i'm only about 75 maybe<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=940">15:40</a> - which is certainly not bad but you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=943">15:43</a> - 200 is certainly a lot faster than 75<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=946">15:46</a> - and so these transcripts that are just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=948">15:48</a> - not transcripts these scripts that i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=949">15:49</a> - read don't have to be super polished uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=951">15:51</a> - you know of course they need to be<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=952">15:52</a> - grammatically correct so that if i'm<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=954">15:54</a> - reading them i don't make grammatical<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=955">15:55</a> - errors but i just need to make a lot<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=957">15:57</a> - more content than i thought i would<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=959">15:59</a> - initially and so this became a much<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=961">16:01</a> - higher priority than it was at the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=962">16:02</a> - beginning so all of this stuff kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=964">16:04</a> - wasn't on my radar initially but i think<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=966">16:06</a> - all of this will help make the video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=968">16:08</a> - content<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=969">16:09</a> - that much better and so i haven't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=970">16:10</a> - purchased these things yet but i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=972">16:12</a> - probably will soon after the new<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=973">16:13</a> - computer that i mentioned earlier comes<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=975">16:15</a> - and i get it set up so we're probably<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=977">16:17</a> - still a few weeks out at this point i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=978">16:18</a> - don't want to make any promises because<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=980">16:20</a> - you know i i don't have everything set<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=982">16:22</a> - up yet i'm still kind of hashing out the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=984">16:24</a> - specifics of how i want to enhance video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=986">16:26</a> - content as much as i can but i'm hoping<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=988">16:28</a> - that building out the framework right<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=990">16:30</a> - now will let me have high throughput<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=992">16:32</a> - with high quality videos in the long<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=994">16:34</a> - term so that's at least the goal here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=996">16:36</a> - now<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=997">16:37</a> - on the actual ministry side a lot of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=999">16:39</a> - what i've been going over here as you<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1000">16:40</a> - see is kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1002">16:42</a> - meta related it's kind of things<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1003">16:43</a> - relating to the ministry itself the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1005">16:45</a> - structure<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1006">16:46</a> - planning for the future stuff you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1008">16:48</a> - maybe it's not very interesting but<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1010">16:50</a> - very necessary steps here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1012">16:52</a> - so on the actual content side i uh went<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1015">16:55</a> - and found the planning document i had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1017">16:57</a> - for the sr4 video series that i have up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1020">17:00</a> - and so i had a document mapping out all<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1021">17:01</a> - the remaining content in the section<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1023">17:03</a> - from the study i've yet to cover but i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1025">17:05</a> - actually couldn't find it so i had to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1027">17:07</a> - spend like oh it was more than an hour i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1029">17:09</a> - checked across all the google docs i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1030">17:10</a> - have and all the markdown files on my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1032">17:12</a> - computer and i even used a full text<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1033">17:13</a> - search application i just couldn't find<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1035">17:15</a> - it and eventually i did find it it<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1036">17:16</a> - wasn't a google doc<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1038">17:18</a> - but i spent a long time looking for this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1040">17:20</a> - and i finally found it and after that i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1042">17:22</a> - verified that it was in kind of like the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1043">17:23</a> - right state and that is like the last<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1045">17:25</a> - things i'd removed from it were the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1046">17:26</a> - slides from the last presentation video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1048">17:28</a> - i did so that means that i can kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1050">17:30</a> - resume that series again right from<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1052">17:32</a> - where i left off right there won't be a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1053">17:33</a> - break i won't be missing anything<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1055">17:35</a> - because i know right where i am and so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1057">17:37</a> - that maps out the upcoming content for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1059">17:39</a> - that video series once i decide that i'm<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1061">17:41</a> - ready to pick back up in video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1062">17:42</a> - production so after this then i turned<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1065">17:45</a> - my attentions to the youtube channel i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1066">17:46</a> - started kind of cleaning things up there<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1068">17:48</a> - this is where i wanted to start i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1069">17:49</a> - already have quite a few videos up here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1072">17:52</a> - and so one of the first things i did was<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1073">17:53</a> - i was kind of cleaning up the videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1075">17:55</a> - from the bible study series we had going<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1077">17:57</a> - through bible basic 6a which is<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1079">17:59</a> - parapatiology the study of the christian<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1081">18:01</a> - walk so this is the uh first bible study<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1084">18:04</a> - recording that we had up uh so we have<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1086">18:06</a> - about over 90 videos in this series over<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1089">18:09</a> - the course of the entire thing and uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1091">18:11</a> - about halfway through so right around<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1093">18:13</a> - week 53 or so um in the study we started<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1096">18:16</a> - getting a lot more organized so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1097">18:17</a> - started organizing things more we kept<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1099">18:19</a> - the videos more focused um so i actually<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1102">18:22</a> - watched all the way through uh the first<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1104">18:24</a> - videos when i had kind of made that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1105">18:25</a> - switch and we were trying to organize<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1107">18:27</a> - things a little more so i had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1108">18:28</a> - intentionally kind of like taught<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1109">18:29</a> - through all the points up front before<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1110">18:30</a> - we had any discussion so we had this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1112">18:32</a> - nice unbroken 35 or 40 minutes of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1114">18:34</a> - teaching in those videos and i actually<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1116">18:36</a> - at the time had edited them into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1117">18:37</a> - separate videos and so that's useful i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1119">18:39</a> - also skimmed through the rest of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1121">18:41</a> - videos coming after that in the series<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1122">18:42</a> - and i thought that i might be kind of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1124">18:44</a> - doing some editing um some editing out<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1126">18:46</a> - of discussion to kind of just try to get<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1128">18:48</a> - them focused on the teaching and maybe<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1129">18:49</a> - i'd like have uh two versions of all the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1131">18:51</a> - videos one that was like the more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1133">18:53</a> - focused version and one that was like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1134">18:54</a> - the long version but<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1136">18:56</a> - i honestly we've done a reasonably good<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1138">18:58</a> - job of keeping things more focused uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1140">19:00</a> - after this point um and so i just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1142">19:02</a> - decided that it wasn't worth the time<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1143">19:03</a> - you know they're pretty good quite<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1145">19:05</a> - focused you know most of them are under<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1146">19:06</a> - 30 minutes<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1148">19:08</a> - most i mean many of them are you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1150">19:10</a> - more that ballpark versus some of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1152">19:12</a> - earlier uh discussion videos in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1153">19:13</a> - series for like an hour or even two<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1155">19:15</a> - hours so um i just decided it wasn't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1157">19:17</a> - worth it time-wise so i'll keep going in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1159">19:19</a> - the focus series there and then i got<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1162">19:22</a> - all of the more organized focused videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1165">19:25</a> - from the later time in our bible study<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1167">19:27</a> - discussion once we decided to be more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1168">19:28</a> - organized split out in a separate<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1170">19:30</a> - playlist from the earlier videos and so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1173">19:33</a> - uh the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1174">19:34</a> - this new playlist will kind of have the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1176">19:36</a> - more organized and focused videos which<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1177">19:37</a> - are probably the ones that most people<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1179">19:39</a> - be more interested in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1180">19:40</a> - just because it's more useful they're<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1182">19:42</a> - more easy to reference and kind of get<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1183">19:43</a> - through you don't have to wait through<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1184">19:44</a> - so much discussion um just because we<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1187">19:47</a> - didn't get so organized in our study up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1189">19:49</a> - until this point<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1190">19:50</a> - so i just organized the youtube channel<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1192">19:52</a> - and better uh better generally during<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1195">19:55</a> - this time as well so for the sr4 series<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1198">19:58</a> - which was my own so that wasn't like a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1200">20:00</a> - group discussion series that was just me<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1202">20:02</a> - um i organized the already existing full<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1204">20:04</a> - playlist for it i also made another<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1205">20:05</a> - playlist uh that was just gonna be for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1207">20:07</a> - the lesson video so i had two kinds of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1209">20:09</a> - videos in this series which i'll make uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1211">20:11</a> - you know videos on in the introductory<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1213">20:13</a> - part of that playlist for the series<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1216">20:16</a> - explaining the differences there but um<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1218">20:18</a> - one of the playlists here doesn't have<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1220">20:20</a> - kind of the more tangential discussion<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1222">20:22</a> - videos where i go over points that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1224">20:24</a> - aren't really in the study but things<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1225">20:25</a> - that are just additional information to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1227">20:27</a> - keep in mind and the other playlist has<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1229">20:29</a> - those so one playlist is longer one<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1230">20:30</a> - plays to shorter the shorter playlist is<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1232">20:32</a> - like just the focus study videos the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1234">20:34</a> - longer playlist has all the discussion<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1236">20:36</a> - as well so it gives you a little bit<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1237">20:37</a> - more of a full picture but you know more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1238">20:38</a> - videos as well so the bible basic 6a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1241">20:41</a> - kind of has the same split but because<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1243">20:43</a> - that was that group discussion we don't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1244">20:44</a> - really have the concept of discussion<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1246">20:46</a> - videos there so i just split this into<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1249">20:49</a> - uh these the smaller playlist will just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1251">20:51</a> - have the focus and organized videos from<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1253">20:53</a> - later on in our bible study whereas the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1255">20:55</a> - full thing will have well it'll have all<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1257">20:57</a> - the videos up and tell those and then<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1259">20:59</a> - those as well um so some of the videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1261">21:01</a> - are kind of double counted in these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1263">21:03</a> - playlists as well but uh the first like<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1265">21:05</a> - 55 weeks or so of the study we had uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1268">21:08</a> - were just quite a bit longer and less<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1270">21:10</a> - organized less focused and so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1273">21:13</a> - that's the full series then we have the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1274">21:14</a> - more focused playlist like i just talked<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1275">21:15</a> - about on the last slide and then for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1277">21:17</a> - both series i actually created custom<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1279">21:19</a> - thumbnails for each one i mean they're<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1280">21:20</a> - nothing fancy they're just uh colored<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1282">21:22</a> - backgrounds with the title of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1283">21:23</a> - studies it looks a little bit more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1284">21:24</a> - professional here at least i think so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1286">21:26</a> - and then added those to all the videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1288">21:28</a> - which actually took forever because<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1289">21:29</a> - there were like 115 videos or so up on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1291">21:31</a> - the channel already um so uh you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1294">21:34</a> - you know that took a while you know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1295">21:35</a> - video by video i didn't find out a very<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1297">21:37</a> - good way to do it in bulk um i did try<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1299">21:39</a> - but i i couldn't figure it out so i had<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1301">21:41</a> - to do it video by video and that took a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1302">21:42</a> - long time i also removed the numbers<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1304">21:44</a> - from all the titles here um and that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1306">21:46</a> - just leaves the video subjects in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1307">21:47</a> - titles which just looks more natural<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1309">21:49</a> - than having like week 72 of the study or<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1312">21:52</a> - something it just just describes the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1313">21:53</a> - topics that it goes over makes it easier<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1315">21:55</a> - to reference kind of in a more natural<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1317">21:57</a> - way so that was the organization on the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1319">21:59</a> - youtube channel here<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1321">22:01</a> - this is very interesting i live really<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1323">22:03</a> - close to a school<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1325">22:05</a> - and so i was kind of wondering on off<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1326">22:06</a> - hours if i have bible studies on friday<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1328">22:08</a> - and saturday nights could people park in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1329">22:09</a> - the school parking lot walk across the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1331">22:11</a> - street to my house so that we wouldn't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1332">22:12</a> - like plug up you know the roads around<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1334">22:14</a> - my neighbor's houses and stuff that'd be<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1336">22:16</a> - nice if it were possible but i sent off<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1338">22:18</a> - an email and asked and i haven't gotten<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1340">22:20</a> - a response yet but i'm fingers crossed<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1341">22:21</a> - you know i see no reason why not and uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1343">22:23</a> - i think it would be you know kind to my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1345">22:25</a> - neighbors and it would make it parking<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1346">22:26</a> - easier for bible studies that we have at<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1348">22:28</a> - the physical house but we'll see on this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1350">22:30</a> - but i i got the ball rolling there at<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1351">22:31</a> - least hopefully and then uh now i'm just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1354">22:34</a> - going to go over real briefly i know<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1356">22:36</a> - this video has gotten longer than i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1357">22:37</a> - wanted for it to be but we're going to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1359">22:39</a> - real briefly go over some of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1360">22:40</a> - upcoming work here so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1362">22:42</a> - my immediate focus or at least one of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1365">22:45</a> - them will be finishing off the initial<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1367">22:47</a> - organization of the already existing<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1369">22:49</a> - content on the youtube channel so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1371">22:51</a> - mentioned we have about 115 videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1373">22:53</a> - already up there which is a lot but only<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1376">22:56</a> - about 60 of those are kind of organized<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1378">22:58</a> - and focused so like the first as i say<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1380">23:00</a> - about the first 50 or so in the bible<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1383">23:03</a> - basic 6a series which was our group<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1385">23:05</a> - bible study i was kind of just putting<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1387">23:07</a> - up the recordings because it was really<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1388">23:08</a> - easy for me to record it but i hadn't<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1390">23:10</a> - taken the pains to really<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1392">23:12</a> - get it organized or focused so it just<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1394">23:14</a> - may not be as interesting for reference<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1396">23:16</a> - for many people um but about 60 videos<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1398">23:18</a> - are pretty good i think and so in that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1401">23:21</a> - vein i'm gonna try to um organize all of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1404">23:24</a> - those things before i i kind of focus on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1407">23:27</a> - other things i want to make sure that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1409">23:29</a> - everything i have already is kind of up<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1411">23:31</a> - to my standards before i turn my focus<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1413">23:33</a> - elsewhere so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1414">23:34</a> - in doing that i'm planning on making a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1416">23:36</a> - few more initial videos related to these<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1418">23:38</a> - i'm gonna make introductory videos for<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1420">23:40</a> - all the playlists that i just mentioned<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1422">23:42</a> - so i mentioned that i split a couple of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1423">23:43</a> - the playlist here right one for the sr4<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1425">23:45</a> - series another one for the uh bb6a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1428">23:48</a> - series keeping uh kind of explaining<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1430">23:50</a> - what the difference between the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1431">23:51</a> - playlists are just to make that more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1432">23:52</a> - intuitive i'm gonna try to actually make<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1434">23:54</a> - a second channel introductory video so i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1436">23:56</a> - mentioned the first one ended up like 45<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1438">23:58</a> - minutes which was a lot longer than i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1440">24:00</a> - wanted it to be and so i'm going to try<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1442">24:02</a> - to actually make one that's shorter and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1443">24:03</a> - then just time stamp link it to the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1445">24:05</a> - longer one for people who want a more<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1447">24:07</a> - thorough explanation<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1448">24:08</a> - because i was very happy with how that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1450">24:10</a> - video turned out i think it's very<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1451">24:11</a> - informative but it might just be a<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1453">24:13</a> - little bit too long is all um so<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1456">24:16</a> - that is another plan here a second<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1458">24:18</a> - channel intro video i'm gonna try to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1459">24:19</a> - keep that one like actually 10 or 15<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1460">24:20</a> - minutes um you know much more rapid fire<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1463">24:23</a> - about uh the main points of the ministry<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1465">24:25</a> - it might serve as a more gentle<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1466">24:26</a> - introduction for people who aren't ready<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1468">24:28</a> - to go watch 45 minutes of explanation um<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1471">24:31</a> - so finally um<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1473">24:33</a> - i want to start filling out all of the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1475">24:35</a> - things for the existing content so the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1477">24:37</a> - timestamps the summaries the content on<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1479">24:39</a> - the study web pages you know this is<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1480">24:40</a> - what i was talking about before i'm<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1482">24:42</a> - making sure that i i do everything that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1483">24:43</a> - i need to for the things that already<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1485">24:45</a> - exist before i turn my attention to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1487">24:47</a> - other things and then i'm also planning<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1489">24:49</a> - to keep researching all that i need to<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1490">24:50</a> - do to finish preparing for the video<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1492">24:52</a> - creation workflow so i talked about some<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1494">24:54</a> - of the technology relating to that uh<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1496">24:56</a> - the new computer the wireless<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1499">24:59</a> - receiver for the lapel mic that i can<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1500">25:00</a> - plug into the gopro the teleprompter and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1503">25:03</a> - then the uh the voice recognition<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1506">25:06</a> - software to help me hopefully make<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1508">25:08</a> - transcripts that much faster so that i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1510">25:10</a> - can actually<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1511">25:11</a> - speak off of scripts for all my videos i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1513">25:13</a> - think that will help improve the quality<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1514">25:14</a> - of all of those factors that might go<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1516">25:16</a> - into making higher quality videos i<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1518">25:18</a> - still need to kind of figure all this<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1519">25:19</a> - out so there's still lots to be done<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1521">25:21</a> - here um at least to meet my ever<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1523">25:23</a> - increasing standards here i keep<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1524">25:24</a> - thinking of ways to do this better<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1527">25:27</a> - ways in which i would like to hopefully<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1528">25:28</a> - enhance the content here but i'm also<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1531">25:31</a> - very hopeful that the weight will be<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1532">25:32</a> - worth it in terms of the quality that<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1534">25:34</a> - this preparation should hopefully yield<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1535">25:35</a> - in the long term so lots of information<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1538">25:38</a> - here um i as i say i kind of hope in the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1541">25:41</a> - future these maybe won't be so long um<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1543">25:43</a> - just lots of different focuses here in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1545">25:45</a> - this first period after launch my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1547">25:47</a> - attention is getting pulled a lot of<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1548">25:48</a> - ways hopefully eventually things will<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1550">25:50</a> - kind of stabilize a little bit so it'll<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1552">25:52</a> - be a little bit more like well here's<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1553">25:53</a> - the study i'm working on right now and<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1555">25:55</a> - you know maybe like three slides rather<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1556">25:56</a> - than 15<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1558">25:58</a> - but at any rate this should hopefully<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1559">25:59</a> - give you a pretty good idea of where my<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1561">26:01</a> - attention has been the last couple weeks<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1563">26:03</a> - and uh with this we will pick back up in<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1565">26:05</a> - uh you know approximately two weeks give<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1567">26:07</a> - or take<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1568">26:08</a> - with the next update going over the<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COWc4Fo8t40&t=1570">26:10</a> - things that have gotten done in the next<br/>
