## Summary {#summary}

In this video, I go over exactly what these ministry progress summary videos are, and also how they are different from the daily progress summary videos that I upload on a separate YouTube channel.

### About these ministry progress summaries {#about-these-ministry-progress-summaries}

At a high level, these videos will be a whirlwind overview of all recent ministry progress and news, sent out every couple weeks. These are made for everyone who wants to keep an eye on what's new.

Most of of the ministry highlights from the given time-window are hit, and then I give a brief description of the goals for the next bit (although not with great specificity, as sometimes my plans change).

I try to keep everything nice and short, so that people don't have to spend very long to learn about what's going on.

### These are different than the daily progress summary videos on the other YouTube channel {#these-are-different-than-the-daily-progress-summary-videos-on-the-other-youtube-channel}

I run [a separate YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhLltbXz6oxCckWAqFnrsw) where I dump daily vlogs that go over the day-by-day nitty-gritty details of what I do every day (and not just the things related to this ministry, but everything -- including my output from my other websites).

These are honestly as much for me as for anyone else, so that I can find things over time if I ever need to reference something I've done or thought on, and so that I can keep myself very organized day-by-day, trying to keep in mind all the spiritual pressure that should drive me. Many people probably won't be interested in these, which is completely logical.

<!-- --- -->

It's honestly kind of shocking how much work goes into (has gone into) everything, so if you're ever curious in peering behind the curtain a bit, this would be where you might glimpse some of the thought and effort that has to happen (has happened) to make it all go round.

Although, in these daily progress summary videos, I do ramble about anything and everything I am interested in too, which isn't as relevant for that purpose of seeing the mechanics.

Although, if you wish to get a better idea of who I am as an individual -- to put a person and a face to the materials offered here -- well, these videos would be good for that too.
