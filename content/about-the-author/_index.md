My name is Steven Tammen. I currently work in Warner Robins Georgia as a civilian employee of the [402 Software Engineering Group (SWEG)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/402d-sweg/), United States Air Force. My team in particular does full-stack web applications with C# ([ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core)) on the backend and [Angular](https://angular.io/) on the frontend.

<!-- TODO: explain why work at Air force position vs. something else, like a higher paying job in industry -->

I graduated from the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) in December 2019 with three majors: Computer Science, Ancient Greek, and Classics. I spent the first two years of my college experience (out of a total of 5.5 -- that’s what changing your major twice and ending up a triple major does to you) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) studying engineering, before deciding I wanted to learn Ancient Greek in college for the sake of this ministry. Georgia Tech is excellent for engineering, but Ancient Greek is something that it doesn’t even offer -- hence why I ended up at UGA. You can see more about me, including things I did in college, in [my CV](https://www.steventammen.com/CV.pdf).
