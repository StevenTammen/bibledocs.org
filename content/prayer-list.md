title: Prayer List

## Overview

This page contains the prayer list for this ministry, with requests coming from myself and the wider community of readers and their loved ones.

If you have something you wish to ask for prayer on, you can email me at [steven@bibledocs.org](mailto:steven@bibledocs.org), and I'll add it to the list. You can also subsequently email me if you want to update something on the list (reports of God working, e.g.), or remove something from the list (perhaps it is no longer relevant).

I default to anonymizing things down to first names, but I can also anonymize further if you request so. (For example, down to the first letter of one's first name, as in "Pray for M's son's recovery from a car accident," or completely, as in "Pray for our brother's son's recovery from a car accident").

I have organized the prayer list into various sections based on commonalities (although of course there is really no wrong way to pray as long we do it with the proper attitude).
