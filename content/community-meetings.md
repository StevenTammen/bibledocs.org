The house should be easy to spot since the house number (101) is in white lettering on my black mailbox -- take care not to show up at one of my neighbors' houses!

[See below](#more-information-related-to-joining-us-in-person) for info about parking and such.

### Joining us over Zoom

The Zoom meetings happen at the same time as the in-person meetings shown above on the calendar schedule; the Zoom meetings are fully tied-in to the in-person meetings.

The link to directly join our Zoom meetings is always visible in the header banner of the forum, and is posted in the common/shared WhatsApp group (BibleDocs: All) before each meeting. (We generally don't change the meeting room/passcode, but we don't post the meeting information publicly here so that if our meeting ever gets invaded by a bad actor or ruined by a troublemaker who refuses to leave even after being kicked, it is easy for us to handle).

Thus, once you are active on either WhatsApp or the forum, you will be able to join our meetings over Zoom. You can join us on WhatsApp or the forum (or both) by filling out the signup form [here](/community-overview/#the-registration-form).

We do ask that most people stay muted when not talking, especially if you have noise around you.

None of our meetings are recorded, so nobody should ever feel uncomfortable talking on that account.

## The meeting schedule

We avoid Sunday meetings so that people don't have to make an exclusive choice between our meetings and their other church groups, but can benefit from both, if so desired.

While we do typically give people a few minutes to trickle in, we will actually start reasonably close to the scheduled times, so just plan accordingly. It is least disruptive for everyone if most people are there when we start, but if you do end up running a bit late for whatever reason, just try to slip in quietly while minimizing the amount you disturb others as best you can. It's alright — life happens.  

## Our Bible study meetings

{{% note %}}
Our formal Bible study meetings **are currently on hiatus**, until things from my ministry launch stabilize a bit more. If you sign up for the [BibleDocs mailing list](/mailing-list) or [join our community](/community-overview/#joining-our-community), you will most certainly hear from me once we start things up again.

Even so, we are still having our other less-formal fellowship meetings. [See below](#our-fellowship-meetings) for a description of what these entail.
{{% /note %}}

### Serious, formal study

Defining terms, when we speak of "Bible studies" within this community, we mean:

- Meetings where I formally teach through a specific topic or passage, somewhat lecture-style
- Slides up on the projector, lots of scripture read, discussion of interpretation and application, and what have you
- Times we intentionally pause to handle questions or clarify any matters from the teaching material that are unclear

And we do not mean:

- Meetings where people mostly just share prayer requests and talk about their struggles in the week, with not so much formal study
- Meetings where a group of Christian friends gather to chat and socialize, with not so much formal study
- Everybody sitting in a circle and sharing what a passage means to them personally (rather than one individual actually formally teaching)

I am not bringing any of this up to try and make our studies appear better or more intellectual than others, or what have you. Rather, I wish to be transparent -- this is "how things work" here. If this sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably fit in great, but our format and goals may not be for everybody. If you are interested in Bible study meetings following one of the other mentioned approaches, for example, our Bible study meetings are not likely what you are looking for. (Although do have a look at [our fellowship meetings](#our-fellowship-meetings), below).

One other point is that the general focus here is not always on the basics. To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with spending time on said basics -- Christian self-sacrificing love, God's love for us through His Son and His sacrifice on the cross -- but we are called to learn more of God's truth than just the very elementary things (compare Hebrews 5:12-14). Our goal should be a thorough understanding of the entirety of scripture -- a lifelong task that we will never complete in totality.

In pursuit of such a goal, our Bible studies definitely don't shy away from diving deeper into things, as appropriate. We do not try in any way to make them unapproachable or unnecessarily erudite or complex (quite to the contrary, in fact), but it is true that the focus is on getting a thorough, complete understanding, rather than staying only at the surface level.

### Finding true (rather than only apparent) unity in the truth

The Church (with a capital C) is in fact composed of all people who truly believe -- and we are all supposed to be united to such a high degree that we function as one single body, the body of Christ here in the world. However, it is a sad truth that there is much factionalism and us vs. them rhetoric within the ranks of those professing Christianity.

It's not that we want to encourage a form of ecumenism where truth is the casualty; quite to the contrary, the truth in the Word of God is the very thing that unites us. If we focus our hearts and minds upon learning, believing, and applying the Bible -- to the exclusion of most all else -- we will find that it is easy to find ourselves running side-by-side with a wide variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds, regardless of such things as race, gender, culture, nationality, socioeconomic status, and whatever else it is we imagine divides us. (Compare Galatians 3:28).

In other words, if we dive deep into the Word of God and keep our focus there, we will see superficial differences fade away as the truth takes front-and-center.

Finding this form of fully-realized unity in the truth (no matter our other differences) can be considered another primary goal of these Bible studies. It is a beautiful thing.

## Our fellowship meetings

### Overview

While the Bible studies embody the more formal side of our community meetings, the fellowship meetings embody the more personal side of things.

In our fellowship meetings, we talk through situations going on in each other's lives, and encourage and exhort one another in the truth. We do still try to keep the Bible in view as much as possible, but a greater emphasis is placed on discussing it in terms of the specific situations actually going on in our lives. We also often get sidetracked on theological conversations about anything and everything -- since there is no set structure or schedule in our fellowship meetings, we freely and enthusiastically follow rabbit trails. You are also welcome to come with questions about whatever spiritual topics you wish, as at least a couple teachers are usually participating on any given week.

We have a wide variety of men and women across ages and cultures represented in our fellowship meetings, and everyone is welcome to come and chat about the Bible with us more casually.

### Why Saturday afternoons?

We have our fellowship meetings on Saturday afternoons primarily because this is when the most people globally can make it. Places in Africa and Europe tend to be around ~5-6 hours ahead of EST/EDT, and Australia (depending on which coast you are on) is about 14 hours ahead (so Saturdays for us are Sundays for them).

Saturday afternoons are thus the time during the week when we are likely to be able to chat with the largest group of English-speaking individuals worldwide.

## More information related to joining us in person

We meet at my house, which has been set up to handle larger volumes of people. <!--, both in terms of dining, and also in seating people for our meetings. -->

<!-- 
### Shared meals

Anyone coming in-person is welcome to join us for a meal before the evening Bible studies on Friday and Saturday. The food is provided, although we do encourage anyone who can afford to help out to chip in to keep things sustainable (we support Venmo, PayPal, Cashapp, etc.). I will usually send out a poll on the WhatsApp group a bit earlier in the week to get a rough head-count for both days, so that we will have a better idea of how much food to prepare.
-->

### Parking

When parking, try not to block any of the driveways of my neighbors, and try to park somewhere in front of my house rather than in front of someone else's house (so that we don't get in trouble with the folks that live around me).

If there is space on my driveway, we do encourage people to park there (it will fit two cars side-by-side for two layers deep -- although it's a bit tight -- and then another two single cars after that, for a total of 6), although do keep in mind that you may get boxed-in, which might prove inconvenient if you need to leave partway through or need to make your exit promptly at the end of our meeting due to another schedule obligation. The driveway is pretty steep for some of its length, so parking with the parking brake on may be necessary, depending on where you end up.

<!--
### Childcare

I am very open to figuring out how to best accommodate children given our meetings, but thus far have no system in place.

You can [contact me](/contact) to discuss things further if this will be something important for you.

-->

<!--
### Meeting recordings

All of our Bible study meetings are recorded and posted publicly on YouTube. This not only lets a wider audience benefit from our discussions, but also lets people who miss a week for whatever reason easily get caught back up.

(Note: the more personal fellowship meetings are not recorded, to help protect people's privacy, and to encourage everyone to open up a bit more and be comfortable talking casually).

Because the Bible studies are recorded and posted publicly, we try to keep things to just first names, and the conversation steered away from the deeply personal. I remind everyone every week to be watchful as to what is said when the recording is rolling, and always carefully announce when we are starting the recording to make sure people are never caught off-guard by such.

Because it is beneficial, we do typically have some discussion between "takes" on the recording, meaning I will pause the recording at certain points to let everyone have a chance to ask questions or just share their thoughts without the pressure of having their words forever memorialized on YouTube. You needn't feel bad about only talking when the recording is not rolling, as this pattern is in fact somewhat encouraged, to make sure the videos we create and share are largely focused and on-topic. Occasionally we do get a bit off-topic and end up not formally recording as much for a given week, which is fine too.

One important note: if you ever join one of our meetings late, do be conscious of the fact that the recording may already be rolling when you join. It is safest if you always act like the recording is in fact active, until such a time as you are sure it is not. Usually you will be able to figure out relatively quickly whether it is or not (one rule of thumb: if it's mostly only me talking, and I'm actually going through slides or talking about something pretty formally, we are very likely recording), but it is just better to be safe than sorry. I can edit things out in post if I absolutely have to, but it is time-intensive and unpleasant, so I very much prefer to not have to do such.  -->

# The general idea of different forum sections

The forum is split into multiple different visibility-locked sections, based on user groups. Only people belong to the respective group can view the content within each given section.

This is advantageous in fostering more productive discussion for a couple reasons:

## Shared sets of axioms and assumptions help make discussion proceed more smoothly

When everyone in a particular discussion agrees on a certain set of axioms and assumptions that can be taken for granted, conversation can proceed more smoothly in many ways. You don't need to define terms nearly so much, nor be constantly justifying the general reasonableness of your positions. For example, if you were to stick me in a very adamantly Catholic group of people, since I would tend to strongly disagree with a great deal, I would find it very hard to restrain myself from constantly asking pointed questions that would no doubt derail the conversations of all the other folks in the group. These people would all tend to already mostly agree with each other, and no doubt tire of defending basic facets of their beliefs to me.

Rather than make pretend that we all must try to clasp hands with one another and come to some form of fake unity, it is much better to instead acknowledge that the truth is inherently divisive, and many worldviews are completely mutually exclusive. For expedience of discussion, therefore, we simply encourage most conversation to happen only within the groups that it is likely to actually be relatively productive in, without underlying assumptions getting constantly challenged.

Summarized as a pithy principle, the sentiment would tend to be "don't kick the beehive." If you have to seriously ponder whether or not you are kicking the beehive, you are probably kicking the beehive.

(To be fair, exactly what is or is not "controversial" within a given group is a very imprecise, subjective matter. And it's not like all people who might self-identify with a label will believe precisely the same things anyhow. But nonetheless, hopefully the basic desire for "mostly only discuss given topics with those relatively unlikely to immediately come at you with pitchforks for discussing them" has been communicated).

## People will tend to open up more with those who share their beliefs

This is simply a common-sense fact. Even as much as it is good to come to an understanding of differing points of view such that one might have intelligent conversations with people of all walks (and so forth), it is nonetheless true that closeness comes most easily with those who truly understand and agree with you.

So visibility-locking discussions to smaller groups of users is not only a matter of discussion efficacy, but also one of efficacy in forming closer relationships. It sounds almost Machiavellian to put things in terms of me "plotting out ways to get people to reveal themselves more and get more invested with each other," but that really is more or less the sentiment here.

The easier it is for people to listen to and respect each other and bond over a shared understanding of things, the easier it is for them to develop deeper connections with one another.

# "But what about...?"

Here is my attempt to address to a couple common questions that naturally arise from such an organizational principle:

## "Doesn't artificially creating pockets of similarity lead to dangerous echo chamber effects?"

This ministry and those "in-network" are all very, *very* anti-cult. Blind groupthink is almost inestimably dangerous, and something to be most assiduously avoided.

So does setting up guidelines for artificially restricting cross-belief interactions necessarily lead to cult-like groupthink? It's not a question that should be sneered at and dismissed without serious thought, waving one's hand dismissively. No, indeed, the question is a fair one. 

See, here's the thing though. This community is completely opt-in (people can leave at any time). It is completely not-for-profit. It does not do a great deal of advertising, does not try to exert any kind of influence (e.g., political or financial), and does not tolerate any sort of member-on-member guilt-tripping or emotional blackmail and the like (that will get you insta-banned, I promise).

And on top of all this, I can speak for myself and the mods and say that we make every effort to *not* shove our beliefs down everyone else's throats in a top-down fashion. There is no pressure or coercion, with outright shaming and mocking of people who disagree.

We will just never back down from what we believe to be the truth (even if it means disagreeing), or apologize for it. And we will make every effort to ensure that people are able to have peaceful, productive conversations among those who are actually interested, for the sake of all who participate.

This makes the management approach here distinctly more opinionated than many other places that pretend neutrality (even though they are never really truly neutral, IMHO). Indeed, we will move or close threads that seem to us to be inflammatory or against the spirit of a specific narrower section, for no other reason than that the conversation doesn't belong in the scope of the section as we've defined it.

This actually would be problematic if we were nothing but self-interested tyrants who cared for money and power (etc.) rather than Christians wishing to promote more effective discussions and relationships among people in the body of Christ. Perhaps the claim that we as community leadership are not in fact such selfish individuals may not sound convincing when coming from our own mouths, but the distinction really does make all the difference in the world as to how these sorts of intentionally-homogenous communities play out in practice.

## "So this forum only offers these beneficial smaller groups for some systems of belief. Isn't that unfair?"

For example, we have a narrower section for only Protestants, but no narrower section for only Catholics or only Orthodox folks or only Mormons, etc. What's more, we have a narrower section for only people who follow this ministry (BibleDocs), [Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com), and other ministries that teach similar things, but no narrower section for only Baptists or only Lutherans or only Presbyterians.

I just argued above that having group-limited discussion is beneficial, right? So why don't we support such discussion among a wider variety of visibility-locked groups?

The main reason is simply one of practical feasibility. It takes time and effort to set communities up and moderate them responsibly. On account of this, you'll have to forgive us for focusing our limited resources on providing the very best experience we can for those areas that we view to be the most important. Those of us running things here tend to be Protestants at least somewhat in the orbit of [Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com), hence the groups that we do in fact have.








But ultimately, the main reason why I will never offer this service is one of voting with my feet. I do not believe all belief systems are equally worthy of support, even all belief systems that claim the banner of Christianity.

Tell me, would you, as a Christian, make the same argument about providing a platform and technical support for Muslims and Atheists? How about people a little closer to home, like Jehovah's Witnesses?

We lie to ourselves if we say things are categorically different among groups that claim Christianity. The unity we are supposed to share is in the *truth*. On judgment day, I do not wish to stand before the Throne and have to explain why my actions aided and abetted the spread of Satanic lies, coming as they may be through the mouths of 





It is a spectrum, to be sure, but the general principle is the same even when applied to groups like Catholics and Orthodox folks. I am fairly certain 



 The reason why this forum offers *any* wider groups at all is because I believe that these things may be of great use to serious believers who align with my beliefs, not so much because I inherently value building bridges across belief systems and so on.






 Far from it.

Put simply, I will never leverage my time, energy, and ability towards ends that I determine to do more harm than good. In much the same way most people would never leverage their resources to aid a terrorist organization, so too here. Please understand, I am not saying anyone who doesn't agree with my exact set of doctrinal beliefs is a terrorist. The point is that 


# Over time, it makes finding materials of interest easier for all parties





There will be some cases of gray upon section borders, but in general, the idea is to avoid going in pointless circles 




1. It is easier to form closer-knit relationships with people that you have more in common with. People tend to open up more with those who share their beliefs and focuses. We have to be careful to foster neither too much of an echo-chamber effect nor fractiousness within the body of Christ, but by and large, it is all to the good to encourage smaller closer-knit groups for the sake of Christian fellowship.
2. Having different sections makes it much easier to demarcate




There are three main sections on the forum: a section for wider discussion of the Bible among believers, a section for people more formally on-board with the teachings of this ministry and [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com), and a debate section. 

When invited, everyone starts out in the first general discussion section. Over time -- upon request, or once I get to know you better -- I may add you to one of the other sections (you won't lose access to the main discussion section). The other two sections are restricted in visibility for slightly different reasons:

- Regarding the section for people more formally on-board with the teachings of this ministry and [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com), we are able to better discuss the specifics of what we believe and help one another learn if we don't have to constantly defend the teachings themselves from skeptical parties. It is more intended as a community of students helping one another learn than a discussion board. (Different purpose).
- Regarding the debate section, it takes a certain sort of personality and mindset to do well in an environment of sharp disagreement and formal debate (in particular, a willingness to make certain concessions in how conversation proceeds for the purpose of keeping the peace). It is honestly not the best place for many normal Christians, and for that reason, it is kept mostly to people who truly want to be involved in constant arguments regarding the truth to sharpen their own positions and to better understand opposing positions so as to be able to argue against them more effectively. (Again, different purpose).

As a rule of thumb, if you are part of a group that tends to disagree sharply with Evangelical Protestantism writ large (things like *sola fide*, *sola scriptura*, and so on) -- for example, Orthodox folks, Catholic folks, Mormons -- you are still welcome on the forum, but we do ask that the general discussion section be kept free from arguments about things that most Evangelical Protestants take for granted. That's a bit hand-wavy (and the lines are admittedly blurry -- define "most"), but just be aware that the boundary between discussion of scripture amongst a somewhat homogenous group of Christians sharing a strong belief in the Bible (the general discussion section) and arguments about anything and everything amongst a much less homogenous group (the debate section) will be strongly enforced. If you are ever unsure, you can always ask, or just err on the side of caution and post straight to the debate section. Myself and the mods will move improperly-located threads at our discretion, and if it becomes a repeated problem, you will hear from us. I doubt we'll have huge issues, but please do try to operate within the goals of the framework as it has been established.
