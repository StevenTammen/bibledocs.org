## Quick reference

### Joining us in person

Here is a link to a calendar of meeting dates and times:

The calendar is also embedded below for quick reference:

As to getting to my house and parking, I share that information in the GroupMe, Signal group, and on the forum before each meeting. The short version is that I encourage people to park in the parking lot of the Elementary School directly behind my house and then walk half a block or so, since it reduces the risk of y'all's cars getting hit when parked on the street, nobody has to parallel park, nobody will ever end up getting boxed-in (like can happen if someone parks behind you on a driveway), nobody will accidentally run over my sprinkler heads, my neighbors will probably be less annoyed overall, and it ensures that the street parking directly in front of my house can stay open in case someone is on crutches or in a wheelchair or otherwise actually must park close due some other physical need.

If you are on crutches or in a wheelchair or have any other need like that, then do of course park as close to the front door as you feasibly can. You are also welcome to park in the driveway.

### Joining us over Zoom

The Zoom meetings happen at the same time as the in-person meetings shown above on the calendar schedule; the Zoom meetings are fully tied-in to the in-person meetings. And when I say fully, I mean fully.

The link to directly join our Zoom meetings is also shared in the GroupMe, Signal group, and on the forum before each meeting. (We generally don't change the meeting room/passcode, so you can probably just bookmark it once and then keep using the same link, but we don't post the meeting information publicly here so that if our meeting ever gets invaded by a bad actor or ruined by a troublemaker who refuses to leave even after being kicked, it is easier for us to handle).

Thus, once you are active on GroupMe, Signal, or the forum, you will be able to join our meetings over Zoom.

We do ask that most Zoom participants stay muted when not talking, especially if you have noise around you.

Even people who are local to me in Warner Robins are more than welcome to join via Zoom rather than making the drive. There are, of course, quite a few benefits to being face-to-face when we gather as believers, but since everything is already set up for Zoom so that some of my geographically-dispersed friends can participate too, local folks can obviously do the same, no problem.

This lets people who are sick still listen in and participate, for example, without risking spreading the illness.

## The meeting schedule

We obviously avoid Sunday morning meetings so that people don't have to make an exclusive choice between our Bible Study meetings and Sunday morning church services, but can benefit from both. I have also chosen to avoid Friday evening meetings since that is a popular time-slot for movie nights, game nights, and other similar social events.

While we do typically give people a few minutes to trickle in, we will actually start reasonably close to the scheduled times, so just plan accordingly. It is least disruptive for everyone if most people are there when we start, but if you do end up running a bit late for whatever reason, just try to slip in quietly while minimizing the amount you disturb others as best you can. It's alright---life happens.  

## Our Bible study meetings

### Serious, formal study

Defining terms, when we speak of "Bible studies" within this community, we mean:

- Meetings where I formally teach through a specific topic or passage, somewhat lecture-style.
- Slides up on the projector, lots of scripture read, discussion of interpretation and application, and what have you.
- Times we intentionally pause to handle questions, clarify any matters from the teaching material that are unclear, and just generally discuss the topics at hand.

And we do not mean:

- Meetings where people mostly just share prayer requests and talk about their struggles in the week, with not so much formal study.
- Meetings where a group of Christian friends gather to chat and socialize, with not so much formal study.
- Everybody sitting in a circle and sharing what a passage means to them personally (rather than one individual actually formally teaching something, with subsequent discussion on the points raised).

I am not bringing any of this up to try and make our studies appear better or more intellectual than others, or what have you. Rather, I wish to be transparent---this is "how things work" here. If this sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably fit in great, but our format and goals may not be for everybody. If you are interested in Bible study meetings following one of the other mentioned approaches, for example, our Bible study meetings are not likely what you are looking for.

One other point is that the general focus here is not always on the basics. To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with spending time on said basics---Christian self-sacrificing love, God's love for us through His Son and His sacrifice on the cross, and so on---but we are called to learn more of God's truth than just the very elementary things (compare Hebrews 5:12-14). Our goal should be a thorough understanding of the entirety of scripture, which is a lifelong task that we will never complete in totality.

In pursuit of such a goal, our Bible studies definitely don't shy away from diving deeper into things, as appropriate. We do not try in any way to make them unapproachable or unnecessarily erudite or complex (quite to the contrary, in fact), but it is true that the focus is on getting a thorough, complete understanding, rather than staying only at the surface level.

### Finding true (rather than only apparent) unity in the truth

The Church (with a capital C) is in fact composed of all people who truly believe---and we are all supposed to be united to such a high degree that we function as one single body, the body of Christ here in the world. However, it is a sad truth that there is much factionalism and us vs. them rhetoric within the ranks of those professing Christianity.

It's not that we want to encourage a form of ecumenism where truth is the casualty; quite to the contrary, the truth in the Word of God is the very thing that unites us. If we focus our hearts and minds upon learning, believing, and applying the Bible---to the exclusion of most all else---we will come to observe that it is easy to find ourselves running side-by-side with a wide variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds, regardless of such things as race, gender, culture, nationality, socioeconomic status, and whatever else it is we imagine divides us. (Compare Galatians 3:28).

In other words, if we dive deep into the Word of God and keep our focus there, we will see superficial differences fade away as the truth takes front-and-center.

Finding this form of fully-realized unity in the truth (no matter our other differences) can be considered another primary goal of these Bible studies. It is a beautiful thing.

## Meeting recordings

All of our Bible studies are recorded and posted publicly on YouTube. This not only lets a wider audience benefit from the studies, but also lets people who miss a week for whatever reason easily get caught back up.

Because the Bible studies are posted publicly, only the bits where I am introducing our topics of discussion are recorded and posted, to make it so that people don't have to make an exclusive choice between their privacy and participating in the open discussions that follow my introduction of the topics (see just below for more on these open discussions). I always carefully announce when we are starting a period of recording to make sure people are never caught off-guard by such.

As to these open discussions that follow my introduction of the topics, the basic idea is that I will stop the recording between topics to let everyone have a chance to ask questions or just share their thoughts without the pressure of having their words forever memorialized publicly on YouTube. You needn't feel bad about only talking when the recording is not rolling, as this pattern is the one that I have very intentionally adopted in order to attempt to balance the desire for well-structured, to-the-point, and focused YouTube videos with the desire to foster open and encouraging discussion amongst everyone who wants to participate. We can veer off-topic (or at least get headed in that direction) here and there when discussing things without at all affecting the video length or content focus of what will actually get posted to YouTube. This lets our open discussions be as natural, free-flowing, and just generally unrestricted as possible, while also preserving my goals related to the organization and structure of the YouTube content. At least that's the idea.

{{% cautionary-note %}}

One important note: if you ever join one of our meetings late, do be conscious of the fact that a recording may already be rolling when you join. It is safest if you always act like the recording is in fact active, until such a time as you are sure it is not. Usually you will be able to figure out relatively quickly whether it is or not (one rule of thumb: if it's mostly only me talking, and I'm actually going through slides or talking about something pretty formally, we are very likely recording), but it is just better to be safe than sorry. I can edit things out in post-production if I absolutely have to, but it is decidedly time-intensive and unpleasant, so I very much prefer to not have to do such.
