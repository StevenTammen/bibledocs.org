## Introduction

The interface for this site is unapologetically geeky in what it sets out to do. I spent many months researching, designing, and testing functionality, even coding a good bit myself since I wasn't particularly happy with any of the off-the-shelf options available to me.

Now, however, I am pretty happy with the results and overall user experience. While I am of course quite biased, I really do feel like this site offers quite a bit more useful content functionality than most sites out there -- and by several orders of magnitude at that.

I do recommend reading this section pretty thoroughly if you wish to take advantage of all this site has to offer. There may be a bit of a learning curve, but some of the neat things you can do probably won't completely make sense until you do.

## Dynamic, auto-scrolling table of contents

Every content page has a table of contents that updates dynamically based on where you scroll, actively flagging the most relevant information at any given point in time to make it more visible and make it clear at a glance where you are on the page:

- All active sections in the hierarchy will be bolded
- Gold lines on the left of the table of contents give a further visual indication of position, including section nesting

{{< figure src="/img/dynamic-table-of-contents-example.png" caption="Note the bolded sections and the gold lines" height="300px" >}}

Clicking on a link in the table of contents will immediately take you to that section on the page. After using such a TOC link, you can then copy the URL in your browser's address bar to save a link to that page section (that you can share with others, for example).

## Special content sections

I take pains to mark out various sections in the writing on this site, according to the contents they contain. There are two big reasons for this practice:

1. Marking out the content sections makes explicit boundaries between types of content. For example, being completely clear in distinguishing teaching from application is important for ensuring that people don't become dogmatic about things that the Bible does not actually teach as global absolutes (i.e., become dogmatic about things that should be specific to only their particular circumstances).
2. Marking out the content sections makes it very easy to skim writings to find content of a specific type or to avoid content of a specific type when reading. For example, if someone is interested in reading mostly about application, they can look for green sections in the text and quickly skim over the rest. If someone doesn't have a technical background and wants to skip technical discussion (involving matters of Greek, Hebrew, analysis of scholarly positions, and so forth), they can simply scroll through orange sections in the text.

Text that does not fall into any of the content sections (i.e., text without any special background color) should generally be taken to be Bible teaching with direct support from scripture.

You can see examples of each of the content sections below, with Lorem Ipsum text in place of actual content. In the wild, these content sections may end up being quite a bit longer, even containing multiple headers and sub-headers.

Note that special content sections can be nested inside of each other, even several layers deep. For example, there might be a technical discussion section that contains a quote section that contains a scripture quotation section. Since all sections have different background colors, with a bit of extra styling (to leave some extra padding), this nesting works quite nicely.

### Cautionary notes

{{% /cautionary-note %}}

Content falling into these sections is of two primary types:

1. Warnings against false teaching
2. Warnings against traps and pitfalls in application

Whether or not you read these sections (and/or how much time you spend seriously considering them) should naturally depend some on your overall level of spiritual maturity. Once a certain level of maturity is obtained, we are inherently more resistant to being blown off course by things that are false (see Ephesians 4:14-16), and also have more spiritual discernment to help us better grasp the general character of what we ought to be about (Romans 12:2). However, it never hurts to get a degree of exposure and inoculation to dangers in false teaching and problematic application, so that when you encounter them in the wild, they don't take you off-guard. (The principle is much the same here as with vaccines in medicine).

The false teaching under consideration runs the full spectrum, from almost blindingly obvious things ("Give me money for my private yacht and God will bless you!") to the much more subtle.

The traps and pitfalls in application also vary in nuance, ranging from "No, honoring your parents does not mean you should help them deal drugs" to less simple matters more like "Sometimes it can be a mistake to be too specific in the advice you give to impressionable new believers as they may come to rely on your word more than their own developing spiritual discernment, which can cause problems for both you and especially them down the road."

Some people might protest that application is inherently an individual matter (see [application special content sections](#application)) -- given this, how can you dogmatically call some paths of application out as wrong? Perhaps the best way to answer this is by analogy. In college, I had a Greek professor who often liked to remind us (particularly after tests!) that "Just because there are many correct translations does not mean that there are not incorrect ones." The same idea holds here. While we often cannot be dogmatic about what someone else definitely should do, we *can* be dogmatic about some things they definitely *shouldn't* do.

### Technical discussion

<div class="special-content" style="background: #ffe0cc;">

<strong>
	<a href="/site/content-features/#technical-discussion">Technical discussion</a>
</strong>

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
	
</div>

As described on the Content Organization page [in the section on writing level](/site/content-organization/#writing-level), the higher-level writing on this site sometimes contains technical discussion that is not included in the lower-level writing version of the same content. In general, the purpose of this discussion is to formally justify points made without toning things down so completely that the real matters themselves are not handled. This is not to say that discussions that fall into this special content section are made purposefully impenetrable or anything like that, but simply that the discussion is not nearly as tempered for an audience with less knowledge.

The upshot of this for most people is that you can probably safely ignore these sections unless you are interested in the full treatment. I am careful to include summaries of the main points of technical discussion sections in the normal text (as appropriate), making these sections completely optional. This means, for example, that if you skip one, I won't suddenly reference something from it further down on the page.

The exact topics covered in technical discussion sections can vary, but the main idea is that they are focused on things that lay Christians really need not worry about understanding fully unless they have particular interest. A non-exhaustive list of things that can show up in technical discussion sections:

* Analysis, critique, and comparison of scholarly viewpoints on various matters.
* Many things relating to Greek and Hebrew
* Many things relating to textual criticism
* Many things relating to more advanced topics in hermeneutics
* Many things relating to more complicated facets of biblical archeology
* Etc.

### Sidenotes

<div class="special-content" style="background: #fffae6;">

<strong>
	<a href="/site/content-features/#sidenotes">Sidenote</a>
</strong>

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
	
</div>

Sidenote sections contain exactly what you'd think they would: writing that is only sorta-kinda related to what is under current discussion.

As a general principle, I try to avoid remarks that are well and truly off-topic, so these sections contain things that are related but only tangentially so.

These sidenote sections and footnotes are used somewhat interchangeably, although I probably use these more overall since they can be quickly scanned/skimmed visually whereas footnotes cannot.

Just like [technical discussion sections](#technical-discussion), these sidenote sections are hidden in lower-level writing, for the reasons described on the Content Organization page [in the section on writing level](/site/content-organization/#writing-level).

### Application

{{% application %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /application %}}

These discussions of application in the application sections are noteworthy relative to other content on this site since they are the only writings that contain things other than direct exposition from scripture. This is because application is very much an individual matter.

Each of us has a unique combination of spiritual gifts given to us at salvation (not to mention our own inborn talents and aptitudes, things also coming ultimately from the hand of God), along with personal experiences that have shaped us over many years, and a collection of present circumstances limiting the sample space of workable choices before us. Put simply, each of us is unique with unique circumstances, so what is right for me may not be right for you, and vice versa.

Of course, some things in scripture *are* completely black and white (e.g., "flee *porneia*"); these are not areas of application. On the whole, however, these black-and-white matters only compose a small fraction of the total number of things facing us each and every day. For this reason, it is vitally important that Christians learn to hone their own spiritual discernment and learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit in their hearts.

#### The content of these application sections

Writing in these special application sections does not set out to prescribe but to describe; rather than coming to conclusions, individual application sections instead focus on examining potential personal circumstances, and how different factors therein might be relevant. In other words, time is spent identifying possible variables in application.

Now, when making a decision, "weighing" variables is important: this one matters for me a lot, this one matters for me not so much, and so forth. This site avoids weighing variables in any fine-grained way (and thus avoids mapping out any actual possible routes of application) simply because these things are personal, and will necessarily vary by individual. (To be clear, they may still vary by individual even when everyone is doing exactly what God wants them to do -- because God calls all of us to different things).

We need to be relying first and foremost on the guidance of the Holy Spirit to get things right, but this does not mean that we cannot or should not also utilize more systematic methods like those described here (analyzing problems, outlining variables, and making evidence-based decisions).

#### Ours is a God of the impossible, and faith is a muscle that must be exercised

One final caveat regarding application is that while it is reasonable and appropriate to make a habit of "doing our homework" when making decisions (as in the more systematized process with variables and so on above), it is important that we not wed ourselves *only* to practical considerations, for ours is a God of the impossible. For example:

* Moses, God's chosen representative to appeal to Pharaoh to free the Israelites from Egypt, was not at all a good public speaker (Exodus 4:10, Exodus 6:12, Exodus 6:30-7:2).
* David, still relatively young at the time, was the one to defeat Goliath, rather than a seasoned military veteran.
* Peter, a fisherman without apparent educational credentials (compare Acts 4:13), became a very important leader in the early Church. (Compare his commanding influence in Acts 2).

In all these cases, "logic" would demand a different outcome than what was ordained in the (perfect and singular) Will of God. Yet these men, even against all odds, succeeded in doing what God would have them do, because they looked at their situations with eyes of faith. Their example should not be lost on us.

Faith is a muscle that must be exercised. Sometimes God sends tests our way that are more or less along the lines of choosing to believe His testimony (as found in the Bible) over what our eyes may see and our ears may hear. Our systematic analysis may tell us to do one thing, for example, while we perhaps instead feel led to do something that ranks quite poorly in that analysis.

The line to walk here is appreciating the importance of faith in our decisions (and taking great pains to not be closed to paths that require us to trust God and not have everything perfectly figured out) while not at the same time inherently valuing decisions that require lots of faith, as if they were somehow better on account of them being more impractical and unrealistic. In other words, while sometimes stepping out against seemingly impossible odds is exercising godly faith (so we should never truly count most paths of application out, even if they seem unworkable from our material perspective), sometimes doing such is also just foolish. Knowing the one from the other is why application is hard, and requires spiritual growth to the point of maturity.

### Indirect reasoning

{{% indirect-reasoning %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /indirect-reasoning %}}

This site employs two types of indirect reasoning: indirect reasoning that uses principles from scripture (more common by far), and arguments from probability.

Because the exact nature of the content contained in these sections is somewhat difficult to explain, there is a lot of writing below. You'll forgive me, I hope. It seemed to me that being precise was more important than brevity, in this case.

#### Indirect reasoning that uses scripture

##### Bible teaching should focus on the Bible

Bible teaching done properly does account for matters relating to the historical transmission of the Biblical text -- dealing with an academic discipline known as *philology* -- as well as matters of ancient history and culture, archeology, and a few other things that cannot be established from the text alone. ([See the following section on arguments from probability](#arguments-from-probability)).

Nonetheless, it is not incorrect to say that in the vast majority of cases, good Bible teaching's defining feature is its almost-singular focus on the Word of God. However, this does not mean that all teaching can necessarily point to specific verses that directly prove the point at hand.

##### Example: Marijuana

For example, the Bible says nothing directly about smoking marijuana. However, the Bible clearly states that we are to submit to government authority (Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17). If the government makes smoking marijuana illegal (as it is in some places), then it becomes wrong for Christians to do it, even though the Bible never specifically calls it out as wrong. Additionally, since being drunk and being high are similar in the important loss-of-conscious-control aspect, all the verses condemning drunkenness can also be indirectly applied to the practice of smoking marijuana to the point that you lose yourself.

##### Example: Arranged marriage

As another example, consider the question of arranged marriage. While not common in Western society, there are still areas in the world where it is more the norm than not (such as some places in India). Yet, some parties want to legalistically ban the practice of arranged marriage for all people. There is no verse in scripture along the lines of "there is no problem with arranged marriage" (that is, a verse directly relevant to the topic at hand); however, we have plenty examples of it in scripture without any negative comment (e.g., Isaac and Rebecca). So, using indirect reasoning, we can still dogmatically say that there is no inherent problem with arranged marriage, even though the Bible doesn't say such directly.

##### Why bother marking this kind of teaching out as different?

Keep in mind that this kind of teaching is different from opinion and conjecture. Bible teachers have a responsibility to teach the truth (which is objective and absolute), not personal opinions. No, what is under discussion here is not conjecture, but conclusions that are reached somewhat indirectly from reasoning based on direct scripture.

So why bother marking it out, rather than having all teaching presented as fundamentally the same? For one thing, while we as Christians can still be confident in indirect arguments from scripture if we go about the process the right way, by their very nature, there are more "things to go wrong" -- it is easier to mess things up in indirect arguments, simply because there are more steps between the interpretation in question and scripture. When the Bible says something directly, it's pretty hard to get things wrong, but when you have to string together a more complex argument to get from A to B, imperfect human logic can lead to incorrect conclusions.

In this way, marking out indirect arguments from scripture can signal to readers "you ought to check this section a bit more closely to make sure you see how the conclusions are ultimately traceable to direct scripture."

#### Arguments from probability

Arguments from probability are another kind of indirect reasoning that deserve special mention. Generally, these arguments are not deductive in nature, but inductive. This means that they don't mesh particularly well with the black-and-white approach to truth characteristic of formal Bible teaching, and generally shouldn't be employed unless there is no other good choice.

##### What do I mean by "no other good choice?"

Most of the time a topic can be discussed in terms of scripture, even if indirectly, [as just discussed above](#indirect-reasoning-that-uses-scripture). As yet another example, consider that while the Bible doesn't actually explicitly talk about a specific kind of sin relating to cruel physical torture of others, it is not hard to come up with an airtight argument against it from scripture. Ever read Matthew 7:12 and Romans 3:8-9?

However, occasionally there are topics that cannot be addressed (or at least not fully) using only internal evidence from scripture. Much of the time these topics aren't important enough to even talk about. (Hence why the Bible, in its limited space, doesn't bother addressing them).

Still though, in a small number of instances, there are topics that we need to take a hard stand on, but don't have any good arguments -- even indirect ones -- from scripture itself. Many of these topics are related to textual criticism, archeology, and historical analysis.

These are the sort of cases where arguments from probability come into play.

##### Example: No, Matthew was not initially written in Hebrew

A good example of an appropriate use of an argument from probability can be seen in the debate surrounding the false notion that the gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew (e.g., [see here](https://ichthys.com/mail-Matthew%20in%20Hebrew.htm)). There is essentially no way to disprove such a notion with scripture itself, but we do want to strongly shut down any claims like this that challenge the trustworthiness of the Biblical text, as being able to confidently trust in the Bible is absolutely critical for lay Christians. In this case, without any scriptural evidence we can turn to, our best weapon against this dangerous false position is an argument from probability.

If Matthew were in fact originally written in Hebrew, we would expect to have multiple mentions of this very important fact (given that the New Testament is exclusively written in Greek, were Matthew to be written in Hebrew, it would be very noteworthy) in early Christian writings. However, we don't. Based on everything we know textually, the gospel of Matthew shows up overwhelmingly in Greek (and quite early too -- e.g., in some of the earliest papyri we have), and while Hebrew copies of Matthew do eventually appear, they are late translations intended for evangelism among Jewish populations.

Moreover, if all the Greek copies of Matthew were translations from a Hebrew original, we would expect a great deal of variation in the Greek text. (Compare the textual tradition of the Septuagint -- it is really appropriate to ask the question "which Septuagint?" since translation inherently introduces so much instability in the text). However, we do not at all observe this. There is variation in the different exemplars of Matthew we have (as is normal in hand-copied ancient texts), but it is not markedly different from the variation found in, for example, Mark or Luke (the other two synoptic gospels).

People who push for Matthew being written originally in Hebrew might make an argument along the lines of "Matthew was originally written in Hebrew, but it was translated into Greek very early, and only copies of this one single early Greek translation (rather than copies of multiple Greek translations from the Hebrew original) happened to get preserved due to historical happenstance, and therefore even early Christian writers didn't know this important secret" (or something along these lines). Again, while we have no direct scriptural evidence we can use to refute such a claim, the argument from probability we have made above shines light on what this claim really is: complete and utter rubbish.

##### Conclusions regarding arguments from probability and indirect reasoning generally

Arguments from probability comprise another weapon in our arsenal, another tool in our toolbox. Most of the time when we mention "indirect reasoning" in the context of Bible teaching, we are referring to the practice of using the principles scripture teaches to weigh in on things it doesn't address directly. Every once in a while, however, "indirect reasoning" can refer to the practice of using arguments from probability relating to things like textual criticism, archeology, and historical analysis (somewhat imprecise inductive scholarly practices) to take a hard stand on some point that we are unable to talk about nearly at all in terms of scripture itself.

In terms of these arguments from probability, as long as we only lean on them when appropriate, they can be a positive boon, helping us present ourselves to God as craftsmen unashamed, cutting straight the Word of Truth (2 Timothy 2:15). In the same way actual craftsmen always use the right tools for the job (not trying to pound in nails with screwdrivers, e.g.), so too should we be as Christians.

{{% /example %}}

Perhaps the most self-explanatory of all the special content sections, example sections contain, well, examples.

Typically, examples are given in-line (that is, within the body of the text itself), but if they get kind of long, then I'll pull them out and stick them in these sections.

### Post hoc notes

{{% post-hoc-note %}}

{{% /post-hoc-note %}}

These can show up in [Reader Correspondence Q&As](questions-and-answers/reader-correspondence/).

The phrase ["post hoc"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/post%20hoc) essentially means "after the fact." The problem with updating writing from past exchanges transparently is that the reader is never made aware that changes were made since the exchange (so the posting party could unfairly rewrite the history of what was actually said -- or something along those lines). But as long as I clearly set apart all information added to the initial conversation in post hoc notes, then no one can get the wrong idea about things.

Some notes may be added in-line [**Post hoc note**: this is an in-line note], while others may be too long for this, so that they are instead contained in these set-apart sections.

### Quotes

{{% quote src="#quotes" text="Source" %}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
{{% /quote %}}

I find that quoting text in larger blocks (even multiple paragraphs) is often useful. While many formatting procedures indent block-quotes, this ends up wasting a lot of space over the long-term (especially for long quotes). Changing the background color while otherwise leaving the styling the same is the most practical way to handle longer quotes, and that is exactly what is done here -- just as with all the other special content sections.

The source for a given quote is linked in the label of the section ("Quote from {Source}") in almost all cases. (The only real exception is when the source is not linkable for some reason, such as if a website no longer exists).

### Scripture quotations

{{% scripture-h p="John 3:16 | NIV11" %}}
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
{{% /scripture-h %}}

Scripture quotations are very similar to general quotes, but nonetheless are broken out into their own sections of a different background color, to mark them out separately. For each section, the biblical passage being quoted shows up in the header, as well as the Bible version being quoted from.

#### Original translations

{{% original-translation p="Romans 5:1" %}}
So now that we have been justified by faith, let us take hold of the peace [we have] with God [the Father] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
{{% /original-translation %}}

Sometimes I decide to translate from the Greek and Hebrew myself instead of using established translations. These are the original translations on this site.

Original translations are a special subset of scripture quotations, so share the same styling and background color. Just like scripture quotation sections, for each original translation section, the biblical passage being quoted shows up in the header.

Inferred words are added to the text using square brackets. These words do not appear in the original text, but are added by me to make things more clear. The King James Version does something similar, but added words in the KJV are italicized instead of using brackets. The main difference in what I do versus what the KJV does is frequency -- I generally add many more words than does the KJV. The goal is to make the meaning of the text as clear as possible.

In addition to inferred words, I also make use of explanatory remarks in parentheses. To avoid ambiguity with parenthetical statements that are part of the actual text, all of the explanatory remarks I add begin with abbreviations, while I will never translate words that are part of the actual text with abbreviations. Here's the full list of abbreviations that can introduce my explanatory remarks:

- i.e.: coming from Latin *id est*, meaning "that is." The abbreviation I most frequently use, i.e. is used to clarify and explain.
- e.g.: coming from Latin *exempli gratia*, meaning "for example." This abbreviation, unsurprisingly, is used to introduce examples.
- cf.: coming from Latin *confer*/*conferatur*, meaning "compare." This abbreviation is used to introduce things that ought to be compared (or possibly contrasted) with the present topic. On this site, it is overwhelming used to introduce scripture passages as cross references: "Salvation comes by grace through faith (cf. Ephesians 2:8-9)."

#### Ichthys translations

{{% ichthys-translation p="Micah 5:1-5a" src="https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part5.htm#Micah%205:1-5a" %}}
(1) But now marshal your [own] troops (*gdd*, גדד), O city (lit., “daughter”) of troops (*gedhudh*, גדוד) [which are marshaled against you].  For they have laid siege to us.  For they have struck on the cheek with a rod the Judge of Israel.  (2) But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, too small to be numbered among the clans of Judah, from you I will bring forth the One who is to rule over Israel.  His goings forth are from long ago, even from the days of eternity.  (3) For He will give them over [to the oppressor] until the time when [Jerusalem] labors [like] a woman in labor.  At that time the rest of His brethren will return to the sons of Israel (i.e., prior to the Second Advent).  (4) For He (i.e., our Lord Jesus at His return) will arise and will be their Shepherd, in the might of the Lord, and in the majesty of the Name of the Lord His God.  And they (i.e., His flock) will abide, for then He will be great, even to the ends of the earth.  (5) For this One will be our Peace.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

Sometimes I decide to quote from places where Ichthys translates directly from the Greek and Hebrew instead of using established translations. These are the Ichthys translations on this site.

Ichthys translations are a special subset of scripture quotations, so share the same styling and background color. Just like scripture quotation sections, for each Ichthys translation section, the biblical passage being quoted shows up in the header.

Ichthys follows a similar syntax as myself in adding inferred words and explanatory remarks in translation. [See just above](#original-translations).

## Embedded Bible app windows

This site embeds scripture in on-page windows from a Bible study application called the [STEP Bible app](https://stepbibleguide.blogspot.com/p/home_19.html). This free web app offers lots of useful functionality, but best of all, it can be seamlessly integrated into the writings on ministry websites using the programming interface that the developers of the application have kindly provided. This means you can leverage the features of the Bible study app directly from the pages on this site! I haven't come across anything else similar in the time I've looked.

I have taken the liberty of adding a bit of extra interface to improve the user experience: you can select how tall the embedded windows are. In general, if you are doing anything more complicated (such as looking at cross-references or lexicon entries), you are probably going to want more height -- perhaps even the full 800 pixels.

{{< figure src="/img/embedded-step-iframes-change-height.png" caption="Above the embedded Bible app windows, you can select the height" >}}

### Features the STEP Bible app offers

The embedded STEP Bible app windows offer lots of useful functionality for lay Christians. In roughly descending order of usefulness, in my opinion:

- Well thought-out cross-references (not an overwhelming quantity of them, but high-quality ones)
- An exhaustive original language concordance
- Parallel English versions
- A topical index that ties into scripture verse-by-verse (compare the Thompson Chain Reference system)
- Cross-linked Greek and Hebrew lexicons. For lay Christians, these are useful mostly just to be able to get a bit fuller view of the original language vocabulary behind the English, rather than going much further than that.

{{% cautionary-note %}}
It is not a very good idea to draw grand sweeping conclusions from lexicons in a vacuum, that is, without an accompanying more complete understanding of Greek and Hebrew approaching the level of actual reading fluency. There is a lot more to "knowing the original languages" than simply looking at lexicons, and it is easy to make assumptions that aren't necessarily valid if one has only a surface level of knowledge.

Lexicons and interlinears make it all too easy to overestimate one's own knowledge, in other words. This doesn't mean lay Christians can't make use of such tools (such a rule would be blatant legalism), but it is just necessary to exercise caution in doing such, taking care to remember that God has called most Christians in the body of Christ to submit to pastor-teachers who have more knowledge than themselves.

It is a hard thing to accept ("Well, easy for you to say, Mr. Teacher, but what about me as a lay Christian?!"), but a necessary one. Humility is a critical part of what we might term "teachability." And since God has seen fit for spiritual truth to come through pastor-teachers in this present age, being less teachable on account of resisting teachers' authority -- instead trying to do everything on your own (all the while lacking at least some of the requisite knowledge for going about things responsibly) -- will necessarily lead to less spiritual growth, and perhaps a lot less at that.

Teachers can go even a level deeper with the STEP Bible app. Aside from all of the above features, there is also additional more advanced functionality:

- Full grammatical parsing and morphology (available, for example, on the Translators Hebrew OT, Tyndale House Greek NT, and Rahlf's LXX). Especially helpful for verbs and participles.
- Complete [interlinears and reverse interlinears](https://wiki.logos.com/Reverse-Interlinear$2fInterlinear_Bibles#What_is_the_difference_between_an_Interlinear_and_a_Reverse_Interlinear_Bible.3f) with many versions, including the ESV and NASB.
- Parallel versions with Greek and Hebrew: English alongside the original languages, multiple original language texts alongside each other (including both Hebrew and the LXX for OT passages), etc.
- Textual criticism resources (critical apparatuses, variant manuscripts like the Aleppo Codex and Samaritan Pentateuch, etc.)

### All the permutations of the embedded Bible app windows used on this site

This list is exhaustive. Eventually, I will get around to coding support for dynamically toggling between all the possible options for a given New Testament or Old Testament passage. (The two kinds of passages are inherently different in terms of textual options, as the New Testament was written in Greek, but the Old Testament was largely written in Hebrew, with some Aramaic here and there).

## Automatic verse tagging in the Bible version of your choice

This site automatically tags scripture references in the Bible version of your choice, displaying them in a tooltip/pop-up. You can change which Bible version references will be displayed in [on the settings page](/settings/#reftagger-settings) (e.g., NIV, ESV, NASB, NKJV, etc.). This is far from the only site to automatically tag Bible verses, but many do not make it possible to change the version, leaving you stuck with whatever the default is on their site (even if you'd rather use a different version).

You can also choose to have verses be tagged with a small L to the right of the reference, which will open the passage in Logos Bible Software. I have this off by default (to reduce visual clutter for all those for whom this is not relevant), but if you are a Logos user, this is very convenient.

All this is implemented with [Reftagger](https://faithlife.com/products/reftagger), a nice free tool provided by the folks over at Faithlife. (The makers of Logos Bible Software -- hence the integration).

## Dynamic footnotes with hover behavior

Footnotes on this site use tooltips/pop-ups in much the same way as the verse tagging, to increase convenience. Using normal footnotes (that link down to the bottom of a page and force you to jump around everywhere) unnaturally breaks readers out of their reading flow. This is simply inconvenient and unnecessary. Using pop-up footnotes solves this problem.

You can see the footnotes on this site simply by hovering over them (or tapping them, if you are on mobile).

Here is an example footnote,[^example] in the middle of a sentence.

[^example]: The body text of the footnote.

Here is another footnote,[^link] this one with a link. Being able to link to things in footnotes is *absolutely critical*, as one of the most frequent things footnotes get used for is citations.

## Direct links to sources

Having written around a dozen lengthy formal papers across my two humanities majors in college (my two longest were [a term paper for an 8000-level classics graduate seminar](https://www.steventammen.com/writings/class-power-and-influence-who-killed-priscillian.pdf) and [a research paper funded by my University's center for undergraduate research](https://www.steventammen.com/writings/better-unicode-text-entry-for-ancient-greek.pdf)), I hate citations and bibliographical formatting with all the burning passion of 10,000 dying suns. No exaggeration. Both of the papers I linked above had multiple dozens of citations across their 30+ page lengths. I still recoil in remembrance of the hours I had to spend dealing with all this nonsense in those papers.

This notwithstanding, I am a *huge* proponent of intertextuality and rigor in writing, being meticulous in supporting all points wherever useful and beneficial. There are parts of academia I find positively intolerable (which parts led to me adding a third major in computer science and ending up a software engineer rather than a classics professor), but the practiced skepticism of all assertions without evidence is not one of them. The scholar within me takes great pleasure in thoroughly-researched and well-supported writing, no matter what it is about. (Sometimes I even find it enjoyable to read excellently-done academic writing in fields I am not otherwise unduly interested in).

Unfortunately, paywalls cripple usable intertextuality in almost all of academia proper. Scummy for-profit publishing corporations keep human knowledge (even taxpayer-funded human knowledge) behind lock and key. For whatever inexplicable reason, lots of academics also seem hell-bent on keeping everything printed in dusty physical books rather than publishing resources on indexable computer networks. Having dealt with enough inter-library loans in my day -- just to cite a paragraph or two accurately -- I still get depressed at how much knowledge is made largely inaccessible for no particularly good reason.

At any rate, soapbox aside, I wanted a way to make referencing resources other than my own completely seamless -- something instant, something with actually good user experience. The internet supports general reference to pages and sections with hyperlinks and anchor tags, but I want to be able to link *directly* to paragraphs or even sentences I reference. Why not? It is technically possible, and has been for many years. So why in the world isn't it done absolutely everywhere, since it is so superior?

While it is still mysterious to me why very few others implement these seemingly obviously-superior direct sentence-level citation links, I *can* explain how I accomplish such in the materials of this site. This will be the focus of the next several sections.

### Direct links to website quotes

Links to fine-grained content on public webpages are easy to accomplish via [Google Chrome's Text Fragments](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/link-to-specific-text-on-website/). If you want a deeper technical dive, you can have a look at the GitHub Repo and the main technical writeup:

* [GoogleChromeLabs/link-to-text-fragment: Browser extension that allows for linking to arbitrary text fragments.](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/link-to-text-fragment)
* [Boldly link where no one has linked before: Text Fragments](https://web.dev/text-fragments/)

Unfortunately, at the moment, text fragment links (deep links on webpages to specific text segments, like sentences) presently only work in Chromium based browsers -- like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The links simply do not work in Firefox or Safari, because those browsers have not yet chosen to implement the functionality. (Boo, hiss).

In practice, this means this functionality will only work if you view this site on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Chrome has the largest browser market share by quite a lot, which is fortunate in this instance, but if you are one of the folks that uses Firefox or Safari, sorry but no dice. For this reason alone, I would recommend reading the materials of this site in Chrome or Edge.

This site uses these links very frequently for:

- Linking to specific things on [Ichthys.com](https://ichthys.com/), the Bible teaching ministry run by my mentor. This is probably the thing I use text fragment links for the most.
- Linking to public-domain or otherwise freely-available references resources on websites like [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/) (technical commentaries and Bible dictionaries), [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/) (lexicons), and others.

### Direct links to published resources (like Bible dictionaries, lexicons, and so on)

While there is an incredible wealth of free reference resources, much of the scholarship is older. This actually tends to be advantageous in terms of the general outlook (there was more general scholastic conservatism and respect for the inspiration of the Bible in the past, particularly in pre-WWII scholarship), but there have been some important archeological discoveries (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls) and advancements in scholarship in some specific fields since then.

For this reason, it is often beneficial to turn to modern resources as well. Unfortunately, modern resources are still under copyright, which makes the above method of instant linking not workable, since it requires public webpages. For this reason, it becomes necessary to link to resources via Bible software programs. I use two programs to accomplish such: [Logos](https://www.logos.com/) and [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com/).

#### Logos and OliveTree

To my knowledge, Logos is the only Bible software program at the moment to support direct sentence-level resource links in resources, and this advantage is absolutely massive. It is also the only of the three big players ([Logos](https://www.logos.com/), [Accordance](https://accordancebible.com/), [Olive Tree](https://www.olivetree.com/)) to have a full webapp (letting you access your library from any computer, even without having any software installed), which is the usage I recommend for the vast majority of normal people, as it simplifies things. For these reasons, I own most of my reference resources in Logos.

There are a few resources that Logos doesn't offer that I own in OliveTree. While OliveTree doesn't really support resource hyperlinking, it does [have an API for jumping to specific verses by hyperlink](https://github.com/OliveTreeBible/OliveTreeUrlExample), which is at least better than nothing. It so happens that all of the resources I use and recommend for OliveTree are scrolled in-line with scripture, such that it is possible to reference them in this somewhat-roundabout way. What I mean by this will become clearer below.

#### How the direct resource links work

*For easy identification, all links to resources external to Bible software are prefixed with a tilde (~).*

As much as possible, I link to things in Bible study software (Logos and OliveTree) directly. As to things external to Bible software, non-webpage things that I can actually link (e.g., a PDF of something on [archive.org](https://archive.org/)), I do. Otherwise, the link is where to purchase the resource (or at least one option for such -- I generally prioritize Amazon links). Any true web resources are linked the text fragment way, [as described above](#direct-links-to-website-quotes).

I create the link text for different resource links a bit differently, so give pertinent examples of all the types here. All resources (both those linked in Bible software and those linked external to it) obey these rules. So, for example, reference works external to Bible software programs are linked in essentially the same way as those that are in them -- that is, [sometimes by section, and sometimes by page number](#digital-reference-works).

Note that I use resource abbreviations (or at least partial abbreviations) quite frequently.

You can see the full list of resources I use and quote from in the site's [resource index](/resource-index).

##### Biblical texts

The links are constructed as {Text} > {Verse}.

I create link text for biblical texts all the same way, be they English Bible versions or Greek or Hebrew texts.

Examples:

* [NASB > Romans 5:12](https://ref.ly/logosres/nasb95para?ref=BibleNASB95.Ro5.12)
* [NA28 > John 3:16](https://ref.ly/logosres/na28?ref=BibleNA27.Jn3.16)
* [BHS > Genesis 1:27](https://ref.ly/logosres/bhssesb?ref=BibleBHS.Ge1.27)

##### Lexicons

The links are constructed as {Lexicon} > {Lemma}.

Examples:

* [BDAG > ἀγάπη](https://ref.ly/logosres/bdag?hw=%CE%B1%CC%93%CE%B3%CE%B1%CC%81%CF%80%CE%B7)
* [BDB > בָּרָא](https://ref.ly/logosres/bdb?hw=%D7%91%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%A8%D6%B8%D7%90)


##### In-line resources: study Bibles, Bible handbooks

The links are constructed as {In-line Resource} > {Verse}.

The main in-line resources I use (the NIV Study Bible, a couple Bible handbooks) are OliveTree resources, meaning direct links are not possible; the best I can do is link to a specific verse, which will navigate you to that verse in your Bible in OliveTree. You can then open the in-line resource, which will automatically sync to the verse's location. This is a bit indirect, but it actually adds very little time in practice.

Examples:

- [NIV Study Bible > Romans 8:28](olivetree://bible/romans.8.28)
- [Unger's Bible Handbook > Micah 6:8](olivetree://bible/micah.6.8)
- [Halley's Bible Handbook > Philippians 4:13](olivetree://bible/philippians.4.13)

##### In-line resources: topical resources

The links are constructed as {In-line Topical Resource} > {Verse} > {Topic}.

These are OliveTree resources too. Generally, what it is desirable to link to is the verse listing for a specific topic. Unfortunately, since OliveTree does not support full content hyperlinks, this is not possible to do directly.

However, we can do this indirectly, similar to how we got to the in-line resources indirectly above. We just have one more step here: once you arrive at a specific verse in an in-line topical resource, you'll need to click on the appropriate topic to jump to the full verse listing for that topic. This adds a couple seconds, but it is still really not all that inconvenient. In the future, if OliveTree ever gets support for full resource hyperlinks, even this slight inconvenience could be eliminated.

Examples:

* [Thompson Chain Reference > John 3:16 > 2206 God's Love](olivetree://bible/john.3.16)
* [Dictionary of Bible Themes > Romans 3:23 > sin, *universality* 6023](olivetree://bible/romans.3.23)
* [Olive Tree Bible Topic Threads > Ephesians 2:8 > Grace](olivetree://bible/ephesians.2.8)

##### Commentaries

The links are constructed as {Commentary} > {Verse}.

The commentaries I favor most are [Unger's Commentary on the Old Testament](https://www.amazon.com/Ungers-Commentary-Testament-Merrill-Unger/dp/0899574157) and the verse-by-verse study videos put out by [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists), but I do also occasionally link to some technical language commentaries as well.

Examples:

* [~Unger's OT Commentary > Genesis 1:2](https://www.amazon.com/Ungers-Commentary-Testament-Merrill-Unger/dp/0899574157)
* [~Bible Academy > John 1:1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDoOQVOk1N4&list=PLMu_1csD4LY_FKevxSZnw21QpImHjyYk8)
* [Meyer's Commentary > 1 Corinthians 4:6](https://ref.ly/logosres/critexe67co01?ref=Bible.1Co4.6)
* [Keil and Delitzsch > Isaiah 5:1](https://ref.ly/logosres/kdotcomm?ref=BibleBHS.Is5.1-2)

##### Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias

The links are constructed as {Dictionary/Encyclopedia} > {Topic}.

Examples:

* [AYBD > Nebuchadnezzar](https://ref.ly/logosres/anch?hw=Nebuchadnezzar)
* [ISBE1995 > Assyria](https://ref.ly/logosres/isbe?hw=Assyria)

##### Digital reference works

The links are constructed as {Reference Work} > {Section} (if a specific section is in view) or {Reference Work} > {Location} (if the link is to a specific page/paragraph).

These sorts of links encompass more general reference works that aren't organized by verse or topic -- books, in other words. Works on systematic theology, church history, and so forth are thus linked in this way.

Examples:

* [Chafer's Systematic Theology > The Divine Program of the Ages](https://ref.ly/logosres/chafersysth?ref=VolumePage.V+1%2c+p+xi&off=1193)
* [Schaff's Church History > Volume 7, Page 98](https://ref.ly/logosres/schaff?ref=VolumePage.V+7%2c+p+98&off=139)
* [Walker's Church History > Page 57](https://ref.ly/logosres/hstchrschr?ref=Page.p+57&off=1446)
