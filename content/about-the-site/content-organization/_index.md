## Most content on this site supports all three communication mediums: text, video, and audio

Most content on this site is offered across all three communication mediums: text (HTML webpage for searching/skimming, slides for bite-sized chunks), video (streamable via YouTube, but also downloadable for offline use), and audio (streamable via Archive.org, but also downloadable for offline use). This is because 1) Some people tend to generally learn better via one specific medium, and this can differ by individual (and is especially important from an accessibility standpoint: dyslexia, blindness, and deafness all pose no issue if you support all three mediums), and 2) Even for the same individual, different mediums can be better at different times. For example, if you are cooking dinner or working out at the gym, it might be difficult to read a text study, but listening to an audio version of it might work.

In general, text specifically is good when you are searching for something, if you want to read back a bit to situate where you are (that is, you find yourself getting lost in the discussion and want to refresh yourself on the context), and/or if you want to compare different parts of a study side-by-side. Other than these considerations, you can go with whichever medium works best for you.

Most all things you could possibly think of related to each piece of content are present:

- Descriptive title
- Link to the playlist for the wider study the content is a part of
- Link to download video for offline use (as an .mp4 file)
- Link to download audio for offline use (as an .mp3 file)
- Link to see the full slides of the presentation
- Concise summary of the topics the content discusses
- Full timestamps by topic (these apply to both the video and the audio)
- Full written transcript of the spoken content (this applies to both the video and the audio), hyperlinked statement-by-statement to the video
- The text of the slides laid out without divisions, to be able to read through it seamlessly, navigate via a dynamic Table of Contents, and search or skim through it without having to go slide-by-slide

## Content types

While most all content on this site is structurally similar in that it follows the pattern above of supporting all three content mediums, it is organized into different sections on top of this. At present, this site has four content types:

### Shorter topical studies

The Shorter Topical Studies on this site go over things topically (tracing a subject rather than sticking with a specific part of scripture), and tend to trace topics much narrower in overall scope than those covered in the [Longer Topical Studies](/longer-topical-studies), which is why they end up shorter.

### Longer topical studies

The Longer Topical Studies on this site go over things topically (tracing a subject rather than sticking with a specific part of scripture), and tend to trace topics much wider in overall scope than those covered in the [Shorter Topical Studies](/shorter-topical-studies), which is why they end up longer.

### Verse-by-verse studies

The Verse-by-verse Studies on this site go over things one verse at a time (sticking with a specific part of scripture rather than tracing a subject). I have adopted the practice of covering verses as I feel led to, which means that rather than going through an entire book of the Bible in order, the verse-by-verse content on this site will tend to be more scattershot, tackling some difficult verses here and there across many different books. Over time, I hope to have the coverage and continuity increase, to the point it isn’t so sparse.

Not every single thing written in these verse-by-verse studies on the site will have a video made about it, but only the things of sufficient length and complexity to merit such. This means that there will be a number of shorter notes that will only show up as text on the study webpages (which are organized by chapter).

### Q&As

The Q&As on this site are dedicated to shorter treatments of various topics, organized in a question and answer format. Some of these Q&As come from correspondence with site readers, while others (both questions and answers) are completely of my own creation.

The “answers” contained herein are not necessarily to be taken as holy and unquestionable writ (after all, they are coming from myself, an imperfect human being), but simply as responses to the questions.

## Content level

Just like essentially all other pursuits in life, spiritual knowledge builds on itself progressively, with advanced topics only really becoming understandable once more fundamental ones are understood. (Although there are differences that set spiritual knowledge apart, to be sure: we have the all-important help of the Holy Spirit in quickening our understanding, and even more than head knowledge, actually believing and applying that which we are learning is critical in spiritual growth). 

Anyhow, content on this site is labeled as to its overall spiritual difficulty level (compare Hebrews 5:12-14), as it seems to me, in order to help readers find the content appropriate for their present level. This sort of labeling is subjective and hand-wavy, it is true, but hopefully it can be at least somewhat useful as a guide. The labeling looks like so:

<ul>
<li><span class="basic">basic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="basic">basic+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="intermediate">intermediate</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="intermediate">intermediate+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="advanced">advanced</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="advanced">advanced+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
<li><span class="mixed">mixed</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Some link to content</a></li>
</ul>

The distinction between the bare labels and the "plus versions" (e.g., <span class="basic">basic</span> and <span class="basic">basic+</span>) is the "ease of acceptability / controversy factor" -- things with plus labels are more controversial and/or harder to accept, as it seems to me. It so happens that many of the things that are controversial and/or harder to accept are more advanced teachings, as one might expect. Christians disagree about the basic parameters of the gospel very little, but particulars of eschatological chronology quite a bit, for example.

The main reason why I only define and use three content levels is because the lines are so blurry and indistinct. I would be quite uncomfortable breaking things down any more, since fine-grained categorizations would really imply a level of precision that simply isn't there.

Part of this is because different people find different things hard (i.e., my <span class="intermediate">intermediate</span> might be your <span class="basic">basic</span>), so any labels I affix are really my best guesses as to how "most Christians" will relate to the content. The same goes for my decisions about what content gets the plus distinction and what content does not.

## Writing level

For this site, [content level](#content-level) measures "spiritual difficulty level," while writing level measures how difficult the writing is for someone to read. If you have heard the term "reading level" (e.g., "her daughter reads at a 4th grade reading level"), then you are on the right track. The [Lexile system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexile) is one formal implementation of the concept.

I personally think using the term "reading level" for written content is confusing -- reading level is a property of human readers, not writing. I have thus opted to use the term "writing level" to denote the level at which content is written.

For example, let's say an article has a 9th grade *writing* level. Alice reads at a 11th grade *reading* level, so probably wouldn't have problems reading the article. Bob reads at an 8th grade reading level, and could probably read the article if he took his time and looked up words he didn't know (and so on). Charlie reads at a 5th grade reading level, and would probably find the article too difficult.

Put simply, *this site tries to write at as low a writing level as possible at all times*. I will be the very first to admit that, despite this goal, not all writing on this site ends up at a particularly low level. While I find it a very worthy goal, it is very difficult to realize consistently due to the paradoxical fact that it takes *more* time and effort to properly control one's writing such that the same content is presented in a way that is shorter and simpler rather than longer and more unbound in complexity. (For me specifically, it also doesn't help that I was forced to do a lot of scholarly writing in the many formal essays I had to write as part of my two humanities degrees in college, so my "default mode" is very dense academic prose).

The next sections will, respectively, outline exactly what writing at a low level means, why such a practice is useful, and then finally the mechanics involved in toggling between the two writing levels this site employs.

### What is involved in a low writing level?

It is a combination of things, but the biggest contributors are probably:

- Reduced overall length
- Simpler sentence structure
- Simpler vocabulary
- A vastly reduced use of idioms -- which are often unnecessary to convey specific meaning, but can make writing completely incomprehensible to people unfamiliar with them
- A vastly reduced use of foreign loanwords and borrowed phrases (e.g., *c'est la vie*, *sine qua non*, etc.)
- A vastly reduced use of complex or fanciful simile, metaphor, metonymy, and so on -- things that some readers may be unfamiliar with (just as with idioms)

### Why would we want a low writing level to begin with?

The simplest way to explain this is to consider the fact that while advanced readers can read writing written at a higher *or* lower level, some people will only be able to handle writing at the lower level. What's the best way to maximize the usefulness of your writing across all people, then? To always write a lower level.

By my reckoning, there are three big groups that benefit most from lower-level writing:

- Children
- Non-native English speakers
- Folks without as much education

Children do not yet have fully developed reading capabilities; there is no way around this. Many children (particularly young boys) also have an incorrigible aversion to sitting still for long periods of time. You *have* to settle for shorter lessons with them, or suffer the consequences of irritated, cooped-up child. (Some children are exceptions, but not many).

Non-native English speakers (particularly those at the more rudimentary stages of language acquisition) have a hard time with complex writing for obvious reasons. English is a difficult foreign language to learn in part because of its huge vocabulary, so it is a good start to not lean on variation in vocabulary so much, even if doing such is considered inferior stylistically. Simpler sentence structure also makes it much easier to keep up with subjects and verbs and relative clauses and so on, which also helps foreign readers. But by far the kindest thing you can do for foreign readers is simply to make writing convey as much information as possible in as concise a way as possible. Fewer sentences to struggle through to get the information is a great blessing for struggling readers.

In fact, the exact same general principles hold for helping all those native English speakers who also struggle with more advanced writing. I have noticed an exceptionally harmful form of intellectual snobbishness in certain Christian circles (not that there isn't a place for scholasticism and academic rigor among Christians -- perish the thought!). It would do us well to consider that many people end up without substantial education not because they were lazy or undisciplined, but because of circumstances largely out of their control. God puts all of us in different places, after all. The Bible itself makes the point all over the place that worldly status is nothing before God, who holds the very strings of the universe in His palm. All that matters in His eyes is the right spiritual attitude. We should thus make sure as Christians that we always seek the best outcome for the Church as a whole ("the big picture") rather than just focusing on the well-dressed suburbanites before us. (Not that there is anything wrong with well-dressed suburbanites, mind you. They just do not represent the sum totality of the body of Christ here in the world).

In any case, the better I am able to beat my writing into some semblance of "simple and concise," the better it is able to serve these three groups who would otherwise not be able to make use of it (or at least not nearly so well). And that is a most excellent goal entirely worthy of pursuit. Even if it makes me personally look less educated or refined or whatever.

### The toggle between higher-level and lower-level writing on the site

I just spent quite some ink arguing for the practice of always trying to write in as accessible a way as possible. Now I'm talking about higher-level writing? What gives?

Good question. Note the comparatives. We are discussing "high*er*" level writing not "high" level writing. In fact, the vast majority of the content between the higher and lower level versions of writing on this site is exactly the same -- written as simply as possible, as just described.

The higher-level writing is in fact higher in writing level because:

- It is longer due to having tangential discussion in the text
- It is longer due to having technical discussion (e.g., of Greek and Hebrew) in the text
- The writing in the technical discussion sections tends to be more complex due to its subject matter
- The scripture quotations in it are all from normal translations not as targeted at simplicity (e.g., the NIV84, ESV, NASB, NKJV)

Or, if you wish to look at things from the reverse direction, the lower-level writing is in fact lower in writing level because:

- It is shorter due to eliminating tangential discussion in the text
- It is shorter due to eliminating technical discussion (e.g., of Greek and Hebrew) in the text
- It does not have the more complex writing of the technical discussion sections
- The scripture quotations in it are all from a translation targeted at simplicity (the NIrV)

And there you have it. I hide two of the [Special Content Sections](/site/content-features/#special-content-sections) in the lower-level writing (sidenotes, technical discussion) and use the version of the NIV written at approximately a third grade writing level (the NIrV), making the writing shorter and simpler overall, and therefore easier to read. However, if you can handle a bit of added length and added complexity in your Bible version, the higher-level writing will give you a bit more of a nuanced view of things.

It is worth pointing out that even in the sidenotes and technical discussion sections in the higher-level writing, I still try to keep the writing as simple as possible. That is to say, I don't switch into full-blown academic mode as soon as a Greek word comes up, for example, but still try to keep everything as accessible as possible, even if the subject matter itself is inherently more complex.

## Toggling summaries on list pages

This site has list pages for all of the content types that go by subject/topic rather than passage:

- [Shorter topical studies](/shorter-topical-studies)
- [Longer topical studies](/longer-topical-studies)
- [Questions and answers](/questions-and-answers)

On these pages, you can choose to either show or hide the summaries for the content when viewing the lists. If you choose to hide the summaries, you will just see the titles. If you choose to show the summaries, you will see both the titles and the summaries. You can toggle the summary visibility individually for each thing in the list (using the + or x in the top right corner of the list item), but you can also do it on a per-page level, or even set a default setting to persist across the entire site.

To toggle the summary visibility for all the things on one of these list pages, you can select the appropriate option in the sidebar menu:

{{< figure src="/img/toggle-summaries-sidebar-menu.png" caption="The sidebar menu option for toggling the display of summaries" height="300px" >}}

To set whether or not summaries are shown or hidden by default across the entire site, you can make the appropriate selection on the [settings page](/settings):

{{< figure src="/img/toggle-summaries-settings-page.png" link="/site/settings/#show-or-hide-all-summaries-on-list-pages" caption="The site setting for toggling the display of summaries" >}}
