title: About the Site

This site is dedicated to providing in-depth Bible teaching. This is its *raison d'Ãªtre*, its reason for being. Everything else flows from this underlying purpose.

The below links represent my effort to document how this site works, and why. Read straight through, this is a fair bit of material, so I would instead recommend referencing sections over time, as needed.

<!--

With this being said, you may still want to read the first three links all the way through. In so doing, you'll learn how you can help this ministry, see what sort of value this ministry brings to the table, and get a more detailed general overview of this ministry, respectively.
