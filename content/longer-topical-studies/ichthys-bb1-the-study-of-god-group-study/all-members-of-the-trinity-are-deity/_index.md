## Summary {#summary}

In this lesson we kick off a series of discussions we will be having about what the Trinity is *not*, to help throw into starker relief what it actually is. This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that only one person of the Trinity is deity.

### Our next several discussions: understanding the Trinity in terms of what it is *not* {#our-next-several-discussions-understanding-the-trinity-in-terms-of-what-it-is-not}

Last lesson we gave the basic definition of the Trinity: "three in person / one in essence" or "one in essence / three in person."

We can better understand what the Trinity is by first considering what it is *not* in terms of the definition given above, so that will be our focus for the next several discussions.

<!-- --- -->

### Key point: God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that only one person of the Trinity is deity {#key-point-god-is-one-in-essence-but-that-does-not-mean-that-only-one-person-of-the-trinity-is-deity}

<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-what-it-is-not-only-one-member-possessing-divinity">Trinity > What it is not > Only one member possessing divinity</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is *three* in person, and all three persons of the Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) are divine. Heresies of the past which have challenged the divinity of members of the Trinity include adoptionism (asserting that Christ is the Son of God only in the sense of adoption), the Ebionite heresy (teaching that Christ had only a human nature empowered by God's Spirit), and Unitarianism (which asserts the uni-personality of God, denying the deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit).

But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are deity. Compare: Is.63:9-14; Matt. 3:16-17; 28:19; Jn.14:16-17; 1Cor.12:4-6; 2Cor.13:14; Eph.4:4-6; 1Pet.1:1-2; Rev.1:4-6.

- [The Seven-fold Spirit of God](https://ichthys.com/mail-Seven-fold-Spirit.htm)
- [CT 2B: Seven Lamps of Fire](https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2B.htm#Seven%20Lamps%20of%20Fire)

{{% quote src="https://ichthys.com/mail-Seven-fold-Spirit.htm#:~:text=Well%2C%20the%20seven,Savior%20Jesus%20Christ." text="Ichthys" %}}

[T]he seven eyes are said to be "the Seven Spirits", and the Seven Spirits are described in Revelation 1:4-5 as the Holy Spirit, occurring as they do in-between the Father and the Son (please see the link: [in CT 2B, "The Seven Lamps of Fire"](https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2B.htm#Seven%20Lamps%20of%20Fire)). Although it is true in scripture that angels are sometimes described as spirits, these seven angels are said to be stars, but not spirits, whereas in the context the term seven-spirits is a synonym used for the Holy Spirit, demonstrating His perfection. The seven eyes on the stone I take to be the Spirit's anointed of the Messiah (the Rock), as in Is.11 (where the Spirit is likewise described in seven-fold fashion):

{{% ichthys-translation p="Isaiah 11:2" %}}
(2) And the Spirit of the Lord will rest upon Him (i.e., the Messiah), the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

In Revelation 5:6, the seven-spirits are said to be 1) "of God" (an odd representation for angels who of course belong to Him, but an important identifier for this otherwise potentially confusing designation for the Spirit), and 2) to be "sent out into the entire earth"; only God can be omnipresent; seven angels, no matter how energetic, would be hard pressed to keep track of all that is going on in the world at all times, even with large a group of subordinates.

Finally, and perhaps decisively, Revelation 3:1 states: "These are the words of Him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars". This verse distinguished carefully between the two, so that *ipso facto* they cannot be the same.

<!-- p="Ephesians 3:14-15" -->

{{% video-only-note %}}

Interpreting Ephesians 3:15 correctly depends upon translating the phrase πᾶσα πατριὰ as "whole family" rather than "every family". (Within its normal usage as an adjective generally, πᾶσα can mean either "whole" or "every." But when interpreting Ephesians 3:15 correctly, it is "whole" not "every" in this specific usage). And so it is that we understand that our global family of believers (i.e., the universal Church---the bride of Christ) "derives its name" from the authority of the Father, just how human families carry the names of their earthly fathers.

## Video/audio transcript {#video-audio-transcript}

{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - hey guys so this lesson we are going to be talking about how all members of the Trinity are deity they are all Divine uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9" display="00:09" %}} - partaking of the shared Divine Essence and so uh in the last lesson we had finished our kind of introduction to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="18" display="00:18" %}} - doctrine of the Trinity uh you know that God is three in person one in essence or one in essence and three in person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="24" display="00:24" %}} - whichever order you want to take it those two things together are the fundamental definition of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="31" display="00:31" %}} - and so while the father is God and the son is God and the spirit is God the father is not the son or the spirit the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="38" display="00:38" %}} - son is not the father or the spirit and the spirit is not the father or the son that is the definition of the Trinity um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="44" display="00:44" %}} - and to help us kind of flesh out our understanding of it what we're going to be doing here um is kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="52" display="00:52" %}} - going through some things uh discussing about what the Trinity is not um so we're going to be talking about what it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="58" display="00:58" %}} - is not and that will help throw into sharper relief what the Trinity actually is at least that's the idea so this week  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="65" display="01:05" %}} - here we're just going to talk a little bit about that about why we're doing that and then we're going to hit the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="69" display="01:09" %}} - first point here about you know how the Trinity does not function and so that is that God is one in essence but that does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="76" display="01:16" %}} - not mean that there's only one person in the Trinity um or sorry that only one person in the Trinity is deity or Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="84" display="01:24" %}} - in essence um so we're going to be talking about as sub points here that the father is God the son is God and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="89" display="01:29" %}} - Holy Spirit is God um so they are all Divine um they all share in that essence of deity and so that's going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="96" display="01:36" %}} - mostly what we talk about this time all right so before we get any further we're just going to talk a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="104" display="01:44" %}} - little bit more about this idea here um so as we kind of started with in the introduction here last lesson we did  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="111" display="01:51" %}} - give the basic definition of the Trinity that three in person one in essence or one in essence and three in person and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="117" display="01:57" %}} - we shared the illustration of kind of the triangle Le here explaining how the Trinity Works in terms of its mechanics  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="124" display="02:04" %}} - and so in discussing it uh later on we'll get to some of the analogies that Dr luginbill uses um imperfect as they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="132" display="02:12" %}} - are um you know we will be examining the Trinity from multiple different facets but here to start uh having gone over  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="138" display="02:18" %}} - the basic definition what we're going to do next is try to understand the Trinity better by first considering what it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="145" display="02:25" %}} - not in terms of the definition given above and so hopefully this will kind of help us Flex out what we mean when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="151" display="02:31" %}} - say that God is three in person and one in essence um rather than just stating that and like I don't know that's great  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="158" display="02:38" %}} - maybe we can say you know repeat those words but we kind of have to understand what it means for us to believe it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="163" display="02:43" %}} - properly and so that's going to kind of be what our focuses in the next several discussions flushing out this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="169" display="02:49" %}} - understanding of what three in person one in essence means um in terms of uh particularly some false beliefs in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="176" display="02:56" %}} - past or or heresies that have come up to challenge uh the Orthodox understanding of the Trinity um and so that's kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="183" display="03:03" %}} - what we are going to be focusing on in the next little bit here um a do you have any thoughts on this approach or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="190" display="03:10" %}} - shall we just go on and get right into it I think we can go on and get into it all right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="201" display="03:21" %}} - great so the first one of these uh things that the Trinity is not or how the Trinity does not function um so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="209" display="03:29" %}} - of the first Counterpoint that we're going to be arguing against to help us illuminate what the Trinity actually is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="215" display="03:35" %}} - is this one here uh the key point being that God is one in essence but that does not mean that only one person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="222" display="03:42" %}} - Trinity is deity um or has a divine nature um so God is three in person and all three persons of the Trinity so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="230" display="03:50" %}} - is the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit are Divine heresies of the past which have challenged the Divinity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="236" display="03:56" %}} - the members of the Trinity include adoptionism this is a a past uh teaching or false belief of certain people and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="244" display="04:04" %}} - adoptionism asserts that Christ is the Son of God only in the sense of adoption so just how human beings have adoption  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="251" display="04:11" %}} - well Christ was adopted as the Son of God rather than being God of course that is a dangerous false Doctrine because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="259" display="04:19" %}} - you know our Salvation as Christians depends upon Christ being fully Divine and fully man paying for our sins upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="266" display="04:26" %}} - the cross as our substitute um and that can only happen if Christ was fully god um because um you know there's some  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="276" display="04:36" %}} - mechanics in the atonement there maybe we won't get off in the weeds but you know this is very important stuff right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="280" display="04:40" %}} - you can't you can't get these things wrong um so that's adoptionism um and then there was also something called the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="287" display="04:47" %}} - ebionite heresy uh teaching that Christ only had only a human nature empowered by God's spirit um so we're not going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="293" display="04:53" %}} - get into the nitty-gritty of some of these things you're certainly welcome to uh you know research them on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="299" display="04:59" %}} - internet find some some past teachings past a certain point they're mostly only useful for us in terms of uh kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="307" display="05:07" %}} - discussing what the Trinity actually is so uh Jesus was not adopted by God and Jesus didn't have and Jesus didn't only  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="314" display="05:14" %}} - have a human nature that was somehow kind of specially empowered he had a full divine nature as well um so those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="321" display="05:21" %}} - are the the things that kind of help us describe what we mean by uh you know all three members of the Trinity uh share in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="328" display="05:28" %}} - the divine nature or they're all deity it's well it's not these things right and there's a third one here as well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="334" display="05:34" %}} - that we're going to just briefly touch on that's called Unitarianism which kind of asserts that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="339" display="05:39" %}} - uh there's one personality of God um denying the deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit um and so uh there are probably  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="347" display="05:47" %}} - other heresies besides you know this is just a sampling that ikus had here to kind of make this point and emphasize  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="354" display="05:54" %}} - that God is one in essence but that does not mean that only one person in the Trinity is deity because they all share  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="360" display="06:00" %}} - in the same Divine Essence um so we're going to go ahead and read some verses here um there is you know quite a lot of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="367" display="06:07" %}} - scripture that we could probably pull in here uh we're certainly not trying to be exhaustive and that's going to be true  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="372" display="06:12" %}} - for all of the scripture we read for uh much of the support that we have in this lesson and the following ones here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="378" display="06:18" %}} - but we're just going to go ahead and go through some uh Ai and I may discuss some of the passages if we think them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="383" display="06:23" %}} - noteworthy um or maybe harder to line up with the points we're trying to make but um it's just good for for us to get in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="390" display="06:30" %}} - that habit of just tying everything directly back to the Bible so that's what we're going to do here um there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="396" display="06:36" %}} - quite a list here but you know there's nothing wrong with us keeping the focus directly on the Bible so that's what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="401" display="06:41" %}} - we're going to do for the next little bit here as we go through these lessons so I'll start here with Isaiah chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="407" display="06:47" %}} - 63 um I'll probably open these in a separate window just so I can see the full passage here um so Isaiah chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="415" display="06:55" %}} - 63 picking up at verse 9 UM and again this is establishing the point here that um all members of the Trinity are Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="425" display="07:05" %}} - so Isaiah 63: 9 through 14 so says in all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="434" display="07:14" %}} - in his love and his Mercy he redeemed them and he lifted them and carried them all the days of old but they rebelled  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="440" display="07:20" %}} - and grieved his holy spirit therefore he turned himself to become their enemy he fought against them then his people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="446" display="07:26" %}} - remembered the days of old of Moses where is where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the Shepherds of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="453" display="07:33" %}} - flock where is he who put his holy spirit in the midst of them who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="459" display="07:39" %}} - of Moses who divided the waters before them to make for himself an everlasting name who led them through the depths  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="466" display="07:46" %}} - like the horse in the wilderness they did not stumble as the cattle which go down into the valley the spirit of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="471" display="07:51" %}} - lord gave them rest so you led your people to make for yourself a glorious name so um this is Isaiah one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="481" display="08:01" %}} - Major Prophets um you can certainly see references in this passage to the spirit of of God and remember this is the Old  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="488" display="08:08" %}} - Testament um and uh we have discussed a little bit last time about how the Old Testament does speak of the Trinity you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="497" display="08:17" %}} - know the Shadows are there it's supposed to lead us to question um to maybe have a sliver in the back of our mind that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="504" display="08:24" %}} - there is more to this than you know there just being uh one God you know um uh uh in terms of monotheistic religion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="513" display="08:33" %}} - that there are there's something there right Ai and I kind of expressed that last week um so aie do you have thoughts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="520" display="08:40" %}} - on this passage and how we're tying it into um the point of all three members of the Trinity sharing in Divine Essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="529" display="08:49" %}} - yeah um not not much right now because I think this one is um it's it's almost as if it's focused  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="539" display="08:59" %}} - but particularly on the Father the angel of his presence is um not very he is there but he's not prominent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="548" display="09:08" %}} - the angel of his presence is is spoken of as you know essentially a messenger but a special messenger obviously we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="555" display="09:15" %}} - know that from other scriptures um then the his holy spirit of course the angle from which I'm looking at things is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="564" display="09:24" %}} - there are people who um are are very big on how there is just one person in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="573" display="09:33" %}} - godhead and he wears so many hats you know so once we are looking at such people this passage may not be all that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="580" display="09:40" %}} - convincing to them um ex except for the the fact that we talked about the angel of his presence and they dismiss that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="585" display="09:45" %}} - angel as being a separate person from God himself so but yes this is one very solid passage that tells you that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="592" display="09:52" %}} - Trinity was involved in what happened with the Deliverance of the um The Exodus generation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="599" display="09:59" %}} - of the of Israel so definitely there is much that is said right here um but it will take a bit of getting into tying in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="610" display="10:10" %}} - with other passages to demonstrate very clearly what we're talking about I mean and it's one of those things where you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="617" display="10:17" %}} - can see the trinity in scripture but you can also see where people throw it out right if they don't if they don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="625" display="10:25" %}} - interpret passages so for example here in verse 11 when we say he who put his holy spirit right um does that mean that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="633" display="10:33" %}} - it is you know we as Believers in the Trinity um and we'll get other passages isn't like it you know Rises and falls  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="641" display="10:41" %}} - on this passage alone but we would interpret this as you know the father sending the spirit right um and people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="648" display="10:48" %}} - who believe in a more monotheistic interpretation you know one person and the godhead would say well it's not a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="655" display="10:55" %}} - separate person it's just his Spirit we'll get into this more um and part of the problem is it's kind of hard to talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="660" display="11:00" %}} - about all this in terms of like right Doctrine without hitting all the facets at once this one specifically we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="665" display="11:05" %}} - trying to argue that they're all Divine we do have another lesson that we will be going through talking about how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="670" display="11:10" %}} - are actually all distinct persons they're not just modes or aspect of a single person um we'll get to that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="678" display="11:18" %}} - that's a next lesson but um you we'll keep going I I don't want to get blocked but I just reading lots of scripture is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="684" display="11:24" %}} - the correct approach to help us kind of get that context here so this one from the New Testament Matthew chapter 3 um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="692" display="11:32" %}} - so um very clear passage here for the the um uh sort of divine sunship is what we would say right this is Jesus's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="701" display="11:41" %}} - baptism by John the Baptist the spirit of God uh descending right so again this is mention of the spirit specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="710" display="11:50" %}} - but also Jesus is described here as the Son of God and we mentioned that there is this concept  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="716" display="11:56" %}} - of adoptionism um but but this passage doesn't say um you know actually I don't want to get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="723" display="12:03" %}} - too far off topic but there's this other passage in the Bible that talks about like this day I have begotten you do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="729" display="12:09" %}} - know what I'm talking about aie um yes Bo it's very vexing because people who get into some of the trinitarian  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="736" display="12:16" %}} - heresies talk about the Eternal beginning of the Sun and all that nonsense and what that passage is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="741" display="12:21" %}} - talking about is the Incarnation right but you can see here in the baptism that what we're actually getting at is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="747" display="12:27" %}} - Jesus is the son of God did become the Son of God he is the Son of God um so yeah I don't know if there's too much  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="754" display="12:34" %}} - more to say here but definitely a passage where you see the spirit of God descending like a dove uh you know very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="760" display="12:40" %}} - uh strong visual imagery here but also of course that well Jesus is the son of God you know very clear proof text right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="768" display="12:48" %}} - um so I believe Matthew 28:19 this next one this is the Great Commission um you know baptizing them into um I this this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="776" display="12:56" %}} - will come up again in one of the other lessons ich this uh talks about this preposition here being into um and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="783" display="13:03" %}} - the idiom of the name of or the person of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit we're talking about spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="787" display="13:07" %}} - baptism here although of course many people in the church teach that this is water baptism but what we're actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="794" display="13:14" %}} - talking about is baptizing them into the person of God um the the the Trinity uh in United um as the three persons um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="804" display="13:24" %}} - it's stronger the trinitarian connection is stronger when you understand that actually because you're saying that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="810" display="13:30" %}} - you're baptizing them into God as a singular person right they're all God um and that's different than just like it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - being some magic incantation you do when you baptize people with water um indeed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="826" display="13:46" %}} - indeed all right keep going so that there's that that um equation of the father to the Son and the spirit in that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="835" display="13:55" %}} - passage which is very significant if if the the if the other two as some people like to say were subordinate to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="843" display="14:03" %}} - father then why why is it the name or the person of the three rather than the name or the person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="851" display="14:11" %}} - father that's yeah and actually in Greek this is what we would call probably I don't know like a Distributive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="858" display="14:18" %}} - construction I don't want to just make up words I don't know if that's an actual grammatical term but you can take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="862" display="14:22" %}} - the name of um you know the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit the name goes kind of all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="869" display="14:29" %}} - right it's not like you have the name of the father and then the Son and the Holy Spirit are separate it's the name of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="874" display="14:34" %}} - father and they kind of implied the name of the son and the name of the holy spirit this is why we get that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="879" display="14:39" %}} - preposition being into is so important um from like it's not a a wrote formula we're talking about the mechanics of of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="888" display="14:48" %}} - becoming part of the body of Christ baptism into god um and so you know like you said this passage will come back up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="897" display="14:57" %}} - um it's actually used in one of the other lessons is talking about the equality between the members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - Trinity like you were saying but I it's hard to discuss all this without getting to all of the bits but um we shall we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="908" display="15:08" %}} - shall carry on um so John chapter 14 this time um so this is Jesus asking the father for the helper right here you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="917" display="15:17" %}} - actually see again all three members of the Trinity this is one of those passages that's really hard to explain  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="924" display="15:24" %}} - of if there's obviously Jesus In this passage who we know clearly to be God in fact Jesus in my opinion is one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="931" display="15:31" %}} - easiest members of the Trinity I think the spirit is harder to see sometimes because you know in John chapter one you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="938" display="15:38" %}} - know the word being God is like it's it's right there right Very Yes um but here you actually see that Jesus who we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="945" display="15:45" %}} - know is God from that passage and others is asking the father um obviously separate from him right to give another  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="953" display="15:53" %}} - helper which is the spirit right and verse 17 says it is the spirit right right and the father can't be the Helper  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="961" display="16:01" %}} - because that doesn't make any sense and Jesus can't be the Helper because he's asking for it right you see this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="966" display="16:06" %}} - where it comes from um and I feel like sometimes people kind of what's the right way to say this they like they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="973" display="16:13" %}} - make light of the evidence that we have right in the Bible and so if you remember last time one of the points we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="978" display="16:18" %}} - made um that I said ikus makes is that ikus is very dismissive of this idea that like you can't get the Trinity from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="985" display="16:25" %}} - the Bible you know that it was like something that took for people to understand and believe or whatever like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="991" display="16:31" %}} - basically like no one actually believed in the Trinity until like the Council of Na or something I think that was 325 my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="997" display="16:37" %}} - days could be a little long but like that's just nonsense because like if you read this verse and I mean like does it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1004" display="16:44" %}} - help that we have church Traditions helping inform us of the doctrine of the Trinity okay fine sure but like it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1010" display="16:50" %}} - right there in scripture you know we're not making huge jumps in logic to get there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1016" display="16:56" %}} - um this is one of those it's right there yeah exactly as a matter of fact um I think I don't know if it was this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1026" display="17:06" %}} - passage or another but I faced off with someone some years ago who was insisting that Jesus is the father and the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1034" display="17:14" %}} - Spirit is is the same that you know he was going off of God is spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1042" display="17:22" %}} - spirit and in truth so he was like well if God is Spirit the father is the Holy Spirit and Jesus is the father and so on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1048" display="17:28" %}} - and so for it was I I faced off with when I was like when you look at this passage it's pretty it's like very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - straightforward was this passage and probably another one I will ask the father you it's not I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1062" display="17:42" %}} - won't ask myself I'm going to ask somebody outside of me and that person will give another helper that's helper  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1069" display="17:49" %}} - that's not me and very clearly if I'm asking this person for another helper I'm not asking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1077" display="17:57" %}} - this person for him himself yeah I'm asking for somebody else so if if nothing else this passage should make it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1085" display="18:05" %}} - very clear that there are three persons in view not one certainly not two so we have we never I think it's like when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1096" display="18:16" %}} - when Muslims would would quarrel with the fact that the Trinity is not in the Bible it's like why does it have to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1102" display="18:22" %}} - in the Bible we did not smuggle it into the scriptures this is what you read out of the scriptures  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1110" display="18:30" %}} - and for ease of communication we just named it the Trinity but it is a thing that's evident in the Bible itself it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1119" display="18:39" %}} - hardly worth a lot of talking about and I think this is why theology as a study on EES is so short because it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1127" display="18:47" %}} - these things are too obvious they are manifestly obvious once you look at look into the Bible for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1133" display="18:53" %}} - yourself yeah all right onwards you know what we will touch on all of this again you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1140" display="19:00" %}} - uh this first section I guess this section will be a little bit long as we go through but it it's not bad to repeat  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1146" display="19:06" %}} - ourselves some in establishing the points um so right uh the parallelism here this is uh the passage in Ephesians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1155" display="19:15" %}} - chapter 12 that talks about how even though we all have gifts our Ministries may be different actually important in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1160" display="19:20" %}} - not shoehorning people into like for example um in the modern Church uh people think that pastors have to be a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1167" display="19:27" %}} - very specific way that's just not there in scripture um but if you look at this we have three-fold repetition here right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1175" display="19:35" %}} - Same Spirit same Lord same God right who works things in all persons um you know I I would say strongest evidence is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1184" display="19:44" %}} - we have spirit and Lord here um separate Divine um yeah the second Corinthians chapter 13 verse 14 um this is one of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1195" display="19:55" %}} - those uh kind of I'm not sure if this is the very end of second Corinthians but it's kind of like one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1200" display="20:00" %}} - benedictions here very common uh you know like I think Peter starts with one too that talks it mentions all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1206" display="20:06" %}} - people in the Trinity right um so beginnings and ends of a lot of the Epistles you'll see this um the grace of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1212" display="20:12" %}} - the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all right all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1218" display="20:18" %}} - of them are mentioned here directly um yeah yeah and again if you just think about this in terms of the analogies are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1226" display="20:26" %}} - imperfect but if you're kind of name not name dropping what's the right way um if you're talking about someone in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1234" display="20:34" %}} - their titles and their attributes it doesn't make sense to like mention the same person like three times like this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1239" display="20:39" %}} - right um you know like it would just be like uh it just is nonsensical the only way that this sort of uh this sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1248" display="20:48" %}} - greeting or this sort of um um it's the opposite of greeting like I'm thinking of like the the Latin word for I can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1257" display="20:57" %}} - think of the English one valuations valuations huh um but whatever what you say to people when you're telling them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1262" display="21:02" %}} - goodbye um uh that this formula comes up so often it just doesn't make sense unless you have the Trinity there um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1272" display="21:12" %}} - yeah yeah all right just several more um Ephesians chapter 4 verse chapter verses four through six um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - so you know one body and one Spirit one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all this one's actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1292" display="21:32" %}} - probably worthy of a bit more discussion because it seems to be emphasizing the Oneness here right um shared Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1299" display="21:39" %}} - Essence um but just because there's one Spirit doesn't mean that God is one in the sense of not having three persons um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1312" display="21:52" %}} - it's it's just one of those places where it's stamped again like all the other passages we saw one one common  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1318" display="21:58" %}} - denominator of all the passages that we saw is the fact that in in one piece of text you see three persons or at least  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1328" display="22:08" %}} - three times The Mention Of God in several different ways so you have like in this case one Spirit one Lord one God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1340" display="22:20" %}} - and Father you know you could make of that whatever you want but in the end there are three mentions here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - and these three mentions follow the same largely the same formula May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and uh the love  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1358" display="22:38" %}} - of God and The Fellowship of the holy spirit so we when you compare that to what we just saw in Ephesians 4 it goes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1367" display="22:47" %}} - um one Spirit one Lord one God and Father you you go back to Matthew 28 as well and it said in the name of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1377" display="22:57" %}} - father father and which we see in Ephesians 4 again where it says one God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - Father of the son and we see the sun replaced by Lord and of the spirit the spirit is a constant factor in all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1393" display="23:13" %}} - these so it's like you keep seeing this it's it's there and it's telling you see this and understand it it's right in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1401" display="23:21" %}} - your face it's not hidden anymore not like it was in the in the Old Testament it's right there glaring so yes not so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1409" display="23:29" %}} - far a field yes just just a point of clarity the word Lord here in the Greek is the Greek word cuos um so I pulled it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1418" display="23:38" %}} - up here here's a concordance that shows it and of note here specifically in terms of the parallelism that ai's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1423" display="23:43" %}} - noting is that this word here definitely referring to Jesus Christ right Spirit Christ God the father right like you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1430" display="23:50" %}} - said right there um now of course this word can actually be applied to God proper so for example up here uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1438" display="23:58" %}} - know as the Angel um you know uh like you see it used it where it's less clear that is is Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1447" display="24:07" %}} - but um it is used very clearly of Christ and you know in context here that's what we would understand this to be um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1454" display="24:14" %}} - yeah I mean like you said it's right there right um yeah I believe this is First Peter I think I actually mentioned  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1461" display="24:21" %}} - this passage this is another one of those another one of those things in salutation mentioned all three members  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1468" display="24:28" %}} - of the Trinity just super clear right why would you word it this way if they were all the same person you wouldn't um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1477" display="24:37" %}} - yeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't make a lot of sense to word it that way especially given all the repetitions  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1483" display="24:43" %}} - that we keep seeing I mean this is a lot of passages and they're all written by different people Matthew was written by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1492" display="24:52" %}} - Matthew we just read Paul we now see Peter there was John as well and all of them are following largely the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1500" display="25:00" %}} - formula y there is God who is also called the father there is Jesus Christ who is every every now and then in in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1511" display="25:11" %}} - different places replaced by the word Lord and then there's the spirit that's always the spirit so it's like I mean if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1519" display="25:19" %}} - this whole thing is puzzling to you it's got to say well there is something being said here that you should notice that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1527" display="25:27" %}} - one definite thing about it all right and last we're going to pick up this is another one of those greetings here you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1535" display="25:35" %}} - know mentioned the greetings and the whatever the opposite of greetings are called I think there's a word for it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1539" display="25:39" %}} - English it's escaped me um but um we have Grace and peace from him who is and he who was and who is to come right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1548" display="25:48" %}} - from the seven spirits before his throne from Jesus Christ and his God and Father right yeah yeah right there again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1558" display="25:58" %}} - um so um yeah this has been an excellent introduction you know we'll probably hit these passages they will come up as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1565" display="26:05" %}} - make other points about the Trinity but you can just see um by way of introduction even to these this concept  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1572" display="26:12" %}} - of things the Trinity is not it's all over the place in the New Testament um for sure you know that first passage we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1578" display="26:18" %}} - read that was in Isaiah too um it's it's more there in Shadows we talked about that right something that leaves a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1585" display="26:25" %}} - question mark about how exactly what is it mean for Elohim to be plural right is it just a plural of majesty or When God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1591" display="26:31" %}} - says let us make man in our image you know it's plural you know it's there it leaves that it leaves that tendency to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1599" display="26:39" %}} - be like what exactly does this mean um and then in the New Testament boom right here everywhere we see this this talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1607" display="26:47" %}} - about God in terms of Threes it's just all over the place um yeah yeah all right well that is our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1616" display="26:56" %}} - general introduction here to pull this back maybe it seems like I don't know that not all of these passages are so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1622" display="27:02" %}} - directly hitting this one about how uh God is all you know all three members of the Trinity are uh share the the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1630" display="27:10" %}} - Divine Essence they're all deity um one of the stronger arguments uh just to kind of close this out in summary is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1635" display="27:15" %}} - probably that that the one from the Great Commission you know we mentioned they're all mentioned uh if we expected  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1642" display="27:22" %}} - that one of them weren't Divine or that there was subordination within the Trinity they're they're kind of like all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - in the same breath here right the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit you know just you know one right after the other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1654" display="27:34" %}} - not the father and then I don't know exactly how else you would say it in the Greek if you were trying to show  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1659" display="27:39" %}} - subordination but not this right um I mean I think anyone who who has issues with actually seeing the equality of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1668" display="27:48" %}} - three can see that how ridiculous it would be to go baptizing them in the name of the father and of Angel Michael  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1674" display="27:54" %}} - and Angel Gabriel because at that point you instantly see the the Ridiculousness of what you've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1680" display="28:00" %}} - just done you've equated two wellknown subordinates of the father of God to God I mean right you wouldn't put them on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1690" display="28:10" %}} - the same level as the father but here we have the Bible actually saying it's like um when Paul says uh just like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1699" display="28:19" %}} - greeting we saw in Revelation just now um grace to you and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ like um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1707" display="28:27" %}} - okay would you say that would you replace Jesus with any other name there and have that make any sense you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1713" display="28:33" %}} - know what I think reminds me of this reminds me of a little bit um in history you know like when kings knighted people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1719" display="28:39" %}} - or whatever there's kind of like this ritual the formula that goes along with it or whatever or they're giving people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1724" display="28:44" %}} - rewards so they're like in the Name of the King you do this or in the Name of the King you do that now just imagine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1730" display="28:50" %}} - there's this dude off the street who walks in and says in the Name of the King and in my name you know well take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1737" display="28:57" %}} - seriously you know it's just like it doesn't carry the power and the authority and you know we talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1742" display="29:02" %}} - this when we were talking about God's Essence as the de facto and de jur ruler of the universe he is the king the king  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1749" display="29:09" %}} - of kings and Lord of lords that's what we're talking about here right and so yeah when we have this sort of and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1756" display="29:16" %}} - especially like I said the the argument we're making here in Matthew chapter 28 hits so much harder when you understand  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1763" display="29:23" %}} - that what we're talking about is spiritual baptism into the body of Christ not just a ritual it is uh yes I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1772" display="29:32" %}} - want to use the word ontological that's pretty strong philosophical Jaron but you know it's a matter of our who we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1778" display="29:38" %}} - our being um our station how we're connected with the body of Christ you know it's a it's a big powerful thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1784" display="29:44" %}} - and for that to be something that happens with all three members they have to be divine they have to be God that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1791" display="29:51" %}} - the only way it works um yes yes all right well I think we have discussed a lot of good things here but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1801" display="30:01" %}} - this is where we'll leave this bit and uh you know the next ones is not that we haven't already had passages here but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1806" display="30:06" %}} - we're just going to go establish that uh all three members of the Trinity are in fact Divine um that's where we'll turn  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1813" display="30:13" %}} - our Focus the next little bit all right so uh before we move on actually to the next slide in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1820" display="30:20" %}} - series uh we had some good questions about just clarifying certain aspects of the verses that we've just been going  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1827" display="30:27" %}} - through um so one of the first questions here um kind of getting at that concept that we talked about maybe people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1835" display="30:35" %}} - an easier time kind of intuitively understanding how the son is separate from the father um but the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1841" display="30:41" %}} - Spirit can kind of be tricky for us to wrap our heads around um you know we see these passages where he's discussed as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1847" display="30:47" %}} - you know the third person but what is it what does it mean for you know God to be spirit and yet you know we have God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1856" display="30:56" %}} - Holy Spirit and you know how exactly does that work I think one thing that will help us here is that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1863" display="31:03" %}} - fundamentally is not like us he's not like the Angels either so when we talk about human beings we say that we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1869" display="31:09" %}} - um the Flesh and the spirit um right we at least ik this teaches as do I um that we are dichotomous beings we have flesh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1877" display="31:17" %}} - and spirit um we are souls biblically speaking that word that we translate as Soul can also be translated as mind or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1885" display="31:25" %}} - life um and so we are uh flesh and spirit together compose uh who we are as individuals and that is what the soul is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1894" display="31:34" %}} - not to get too often the WS there but um point being when we talk about human spirits that is like the part of us that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1900" display="31:40" %}} - is not physical fleshly um but human beings are composed of both flesh and spirit in fact um it's an important  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1908" display="31:48" %}} - Doctrine in terms of our resurrection that we will be resurrected into bodies rather than um being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1914" display="31:54" %}} - incorporeal uh boy that's a big word um God fundamentally is God God's not like this right Jesus actually has a human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1924" display="32:04" %}} - nature it's very one of the things that ought to blow our minds about the Incarnation and the Dual nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1929" display="32:09" %}} - Christ being fully God and fully man is that he actually does have a human nature um but he also has the Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1936" display="32:16" %}} - Essence of God and that's what we've been talking about here um so maybe all of this doesn't maybe it doesn't help  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1942" display="32:22" %}} - right but what I'm trying to get at is that God doesn't have like I don't know like his his Spirit as something that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1950" display="32:30" %}} - like separate from his being generally not in the same way that we as humans do because our beings are not composed just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1957" display="32:37" %}} - of spirit um and also I'm trying to think about the right way to phrase this too we talked some  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1964" display="32:44" %}} - about how God isn't part of SpaceTime um and so when we say that Angels Are Spiritual they're also Bound by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1971" display="32:51" %}} - SpaceTime and I I I think we spent some time a you might remember better than me we spent some time talking about that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1977" display="32:57" %}} - right um a angels are not as constrained as we are in certain ways but they're also like they're not like God too um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1987" display="33:07" %}} - and so Angels Are Spiritual yes but they're also not spiritual how God is spiritual so I don't know if I'm helping  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1994" display="33:14" %}} - much other than just saying God is very different than us right um and I think how we talk about it kind of conditions  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2001" display="33:21" %}} - maybe how hard it is for us to understand so a how about how about you go for a bit here see if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2007" display="33:27" %}} - it so I want to assure you that the way you you describe it is exactly right um the the spirituality of God the reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2017" display="33:37" %}} - John John chapter 4 talks about God being a spirit is to was specifically to tell the woman at the well of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2026" display="33:46" %}} - SAA that God was not limited by location the woman had been asking are we supposed to Worship in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2036" display="33:56" %}} - temple in Jerusalem or on the mountains and Jesus was telling her it makes no difference to God where you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2046" display="34:06" %}} - worship because he himself is not bound by any location that was what he was saying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2053" display="34:13" %}} - her so it wasn't so much that God is a spirit so that you start thinking well that must mean that God is the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2064" display="34:24" %}} - Spirit and the father is is the holy spirit Jesus is the holy spirit because the holy spirit is spirit it's talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2072" display="34:32" %}} - about what type of being so to speak and we have to be very careful about that word what type of being God is that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2081" display="34:41" %}} - what it's saying and that is to say strictly speaking the father is a spirit the son is a spir is a spirit the holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2094" display="34:54" %}} - spirit is a spirit so it's not that that God is a spirit and somehow we have to equate the father and the son to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2102" display="35:02" %}} - holy spirit for that reason now holy spirit is a title that the Bible has given to us for the third person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2112" display="35:12" %}} - Trinity it is not in any way a description or a definition of the type of God's being it's just the title given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2121" display="35:21" %}} - to the third person of the Trinity as a matter of fact the only name personal name that we have for God at all in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2130" display="35:30" %}} - scriptures is Jesus Christ Jesus not well Christ Christ is the title too and think about it that name is speaking of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2140" display="35:40" %}} - the fact that God is the savior of the human race we don't have a name in the scriptures just as my name is Odie and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2151" display="35:51" %}} - Steven's name is Steven we don't have one for God in the Bible apart from Jesus Christ we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2158" display="35:58" %}} - titles for God we have descriptive um uh names too like we the the closest you can get we have the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2169" display="36:09" %}} - you know the tetragramaton in that's what I was just talk about we have the the I am name but that I am name is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2178" display="36:18" %}} - speaking to what deity is and basically that was God saying to Moses I am the true God because I am  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2187" display="36:27" %}} - that which is and will always be and will never change that was he was made basically making a claim to Moses I am  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2197" display="36:37" %}} - the true God so when you go to the Israelites tell them that the true God sent you to them that's the the name by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2204" display="36:44" %}} - which I will be known that is I'm laying claim to deity and everything that calls itself deity is alive before me so we we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2214" display="36:54" %}} - get to hear God make a claim to what it is which is self-existence that he he exists entirely on his own will that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2222" display="37:02" %}} - is not subject to any external influence he will never change has never changed will never and and is not changing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2230" display="37:10" %}} - that's what he was saying to um Moses at that point and once once you you you understand all of this you come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2238" display="37:18" %}} - appreciate for example when um Jacob asked the Lord when he was wrestling with him what is your name and he said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2245" display="37:25" %}} - why do you ask him my name saying it's too wonderful for you you you you can't know me that intimately just yet because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2254" display="37:34" %}} - that that degree of intimacy is too much for you to bear and and it's true we can't bear it in the flesh it will take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2260" display="37:40" %}} - our actually um being removed from this body or being in the resurrection body we basically have to be outside of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2268" display="37:48" %}} - flesh to be able to experience God in that degree of intimacy but the point is that when the Bible talks about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2277" display="37:57" %}} - being a spirit it's not saying God is the holy spirit it's saying that that is the type of being that he is now just as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2288" display="38:08" %}} - Stephen has said too there's a difference between God's spirituality and spirituality of everything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2293" display="38:13" %}} - exists and we have to be very clear about this apart from Flora I think that refers to plant life everything else on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2302" display="38:22" %}} - Earth has a spirit that's that's one thing we have to pay attention to Ecclesiastes is very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2308" display="38:28" %}} - clear that even animals possess a spirit so um angels are spirits human beings are spirits that live in in bodies you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2318" display="38:38" %}} - know can I cut in here for a sec I think this will really help it's because spirit in the Bible I pulled up both the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2324" display="38:44" %}} - Hebrew word here ruak and the Greek word Numa both of these and this is such a such a huge thing and it's you can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2332" display="38:52" %}} - miss it because the same word used for Spirit in both the old test and the New Testament they have the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2338" display="38:58" %}} - connotations even across the two languages and Greek and Hebrew are very dissimilar languages right Hebrew is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2342" display="39:02" %}} - Semitic Greek is indoan etc etc um but it means breath as well things that are alive have Spirits spirit and breath are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2353" display="39:13" %}} - synonymous now um Audie has been talking about the title and the the you know sort of this distinction between names  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2359" display="39:19" %}} - and titles the Holy Spirit as we've said it's a title and what it gets to um and this is one of those critical things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2366" display="39:26" %}} - when we talk about the roles in the Trinity uh the adopted roles that how we relate to the Trinity um in their plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2372" display="39:32" %}} - for mankind the spirit is the Unseen empowerer right just how the wind has its effects it's not for no reason that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2381" display="39:41" %}} - this title was chosen is what we're saying exactly exactly that's an excellent way to to describe that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - think that actually puts P to that question so um bottom line is when we see in John chapter 4 God is a spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2395" display="39:55" %}} - it's not telling us in any way that we should restrict the understanding of the godhead to just the Holy Spirit um I was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2404" display="40:04" %}} - going to point out too that there are different types of spirits so to speak there Angelic Spirits there are human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2410" display="40:10" %}} - Spirits there are animal spirits and then there is God God is a spirit in the sense of not being part of the creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2418" display="40:18" %}} - that he made he is not anything like the universe so his spirituality and the spirituality of angels are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2427" display="40:27" %}} - Worlds Apart they're not even similar in that sense because the spirituality of of angels was created the spiritually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2435" display="40:35" %}} - the spirituality of God is what he is it's an uncreated thing I will also say that I think yeah I I think one other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2444" display="40:44" %}} - point to make here um I'm just trying to put my finger on what I was trying to say earlier was that it God doesn't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2451" display="40:51" %}} - anything other than Spirit right and I made this point with humans right but it's not like you talk about the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2457" display="40:57" %}} - of God as if God exists you know as if it's just like part of God right um you know like God has some other thing and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2464" display="41:04" %}} - then God has his Spirit right God is Spirit you know in the in the Divine spirit that we're talking about here as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2470" display="41:10" %}} - distinct from the other types that Audi's mentioned um I don't know if that if that helps  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2476" display="41:16" %}} - but like you can't disentangle it is the thing and when we talk about the capital T Holy Spirit yeah that was a very good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2484" display="41:24" %}} - point particularly too because of when people say that the father sends his Spirit as if he has something other than  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2491" display="41:31" %}} - Spirit yeah he is spirit so if the father is sending the spirit it is Spirit sending Spirit that's just how it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2499" display="41:39" %}} - how that works there is no other but in terms of what we would call Essence or ontology or whatever to use the big  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2505" display="41:45" %}} - words but like but that's not even what those pastors are getting at when we say the father sends the spirit what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2510" display="41:50" %}} - talking about is the father sending the third person of the Trinity as the helper exactly and that's the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2516" display="41:56" %}} - that's the point that is just to say that it's not like the father is like the body something and the spirit is his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2525" display="42:05" %}} - Spirit I've heard those arguments and what you said really gets at the heart of them which is God is not made up of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2532" display="42:12" %}} - multiple parts and and one part of his is is the spirit that he sends forth or something of that sort what we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2538" display="42:18" %}} - saying essentially is that the definition of God in terms of type of being is Spirit that's what the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2547" display="42:27" %}} - tells us so we should stop thinking in terms of oh because the Bible says God is a spirit there must be some way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2555" display="42:35" %}} - reconciling the fact that he is called Holy Spirit and he is called father and he's also called Jesus Christ it must be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2562" display="42:42" %}} - that the holy spirit is the spirit of the father as if the father were an empty husk that has a spirit like we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2571" display="42:51" %}} - human beings we have a spirit or we are a spirit living in a body or something we are made of two comp components or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2580" display="43:00" %}} - something of that sort well just to just to rip on it even more it actually makes no sense from a I want to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2586" display="43:06" %}} - philosophical point of view maybe that's not quite the right word but if God is being and we just use this point that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2592" display="43:12" %}} - things that are alive have breath you see where I'm going with this right yeah how can God not be alive you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2599" display="43:19" %}} - know it doesn't make sense that's why God has to be spirit I hope I'm not pushing the the the words connotation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2604" display="43:24" %}} - too far here but you see where going right that there's no way in which God is somehow not Spirit you know because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2611" display="43:31" %}} - that's that's what defines existence that's what defines being um yes at least in the Eternal sense um so yes um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2620" display="43:40" %}} - yes so that that that that makes a that makes a a great deal of sense okay um it looks like Lisa had a follow-up question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - so her follow-up question here was why couldn't the Spirit come while Jesus was here if they're separate beings so I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - don't think it's a matter of couldn't as this is more a question of why didn't the father send the spirit until after  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2645" display="44:05" %}} - Jesus was ascended and that's not a matter of could or could not that's a matter of God's choice in perfect timing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2653" display="44:13" %}} - right because God go ahead sorry I'm sorry I'm cutting in but the Holy Spirit was actually here on Earth with Jesus at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2662" display="44:22" %}} - the same time not only was he he actually I mean the Bible tells us the spirit of God came to rest upon Jesus at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2669" display="44:29" %}} - at the baptism there was also the fact that the disciples were sent forth with a portion of the spirit on them there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2678" display="44:38" %}} - was John the Baptist at the same time whom of whom it was recorded in Luke that the spirit of God was upon him from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2688" display="44:48" %}} - the womb so I'm not sure I'm not sure we have any basis on which to say that the Holy Spirit was not here at this same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2696" display="44:56" %}} - time that Jesus was they were both on Earth I know I know what the question is getting at though right why didn't the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2703" display="45:03" %}} - Holy Spirit personally indwell most humans until after Pentecost right I it's more along the lines right because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2710" display="45:10" %}} - even people in the old test like David had the Holy Spirit right um Samuel right prophets and we know that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2717" display="45:17" %}} - restraining Ministry of the Holy Spirit has always been present since the beginning and when it's removed I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2722" display="45:22" %}} - it's what second Thessalonians talks about it first Thessalonians maybe you know the remove  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2727" display="45:27" %}} - yes yeah um the removal of the Restraint of the Holy Spirit things will go south real quick and that is the impact of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2734" display="45:34" %}} - spirit being here spirit's always been here right but I I I mean I can't speak for Lisa but I'm guessing that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2739" display="45:39" %}} - question is more what about you know like when we have these passages that says that um Jesus is asking the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2747" display="45:47" %}} - to send the helper right um why why wasn't the helper sent before that maybe that's more where we're going here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2757" display="45:57" %}} - okay can we confirm confirm that uh although we will of course discuss that question as well but yeah Lisa says Lisa  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2765" display="46:05" %}} - says that's what it is yeah okay so go on then uh well more to me I think this gets into the wisdom of the plan of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2775" display="46:15" %}} - um you know uh could people have been indwelt by the holy spirit before Jesus ascended answer to that seems to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2786" display="46:26" %}} - well I mean we certainly had people who acted under the influence of the holy spirit before this point right um I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2793" display="46:33" %}} - think part of it is that you know it's the whole Paradigm Shift of we are no longer under the law we're we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2800" display="46:40" %}} - dwelling under grace Christ has ascended we are positionally our sin has been blotted out in the Book of Life we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2807" display="46:47" %}} - right with the father reconciled to God and we have that Unity um I see the think I'm not sure that the phrasing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2815" display="46:55" %}} - could could not is necessarily the right way to look at this so much as it's a uh being sealed with the Holy Spirit under  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2822" display="47:02" %}} - the New Covenant is the sign of reconciliation with God maybe that's too hand wavy but um I'm interested to see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2830" display="47:10" %}} - what you say um okay so um there's John chapter 7 verse 39 and it goes but this he spoke  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2840" display="47:20" %}} - concerning the spirit whom those believing in him would receive for the Holy Spirit was not yet given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2846" display="47:26" %}} - because Jesus was not yet glorified okay so um the answer is right there might take a little bit of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2854" display="47:34" %}} - unpacking to actually you know see what it's saying but the answer is right there on the face of it Jesus was not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2861" display="47:41" %}} - yet glorified therefore the spirit was not yet given we know that in fact Jesus said to the disciples um the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2869" display="47:49" %}} - who will be in you he is with you now but he will be in you later that's what he said to them just before he went to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2877" display="47:57" %}} - the Cross that's in John chapter 16 I believe it's somewhere between John 14 and John 16  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2883" display="48:03" %}} - so what is this um he's not yet being glorified talking about let's remember what's going on in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2894" display="48:14" %}} - story We Are by Nature God's enemies we're Rebels and while some of us don't quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2904" display="48:24" %}} - well not some of us General we just don't really get what's happening the the relationship that God's Free Will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2912" display="48:32" %}} - creatures were supposed to have with him is one of intimacy it's symbolized by marriage the same way that a man and a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2920" display="48:40" %}} - woman come together and become one flesh that is literally there's no difference between the two of them they're in such  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2927" display="48:47" %}} - Perfect Harmony that they are one thing and this is also what we see in the Trinity which is why Jesus said the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2935" display="48:55" %}} - prayer he said in John 17 that they may be one as we are one that they may be one with us so the idea is that we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2942" display="49:02" %}} - have this same Unity with with with the Trinity that the Trinity has in itself that's what God is aiming for he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2951" display="49:11" %}} - dwelling in us and Us in him that's what he's pushing for now because we were his enemies on what basis then would he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2963" display="49:23" %}} - grant us that Unity so when his Spirit was actually operating on uh prophets and kings and you know Believers of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2973" display="49:33" %}} - old times it was more like I'm doing that in view it's like a uh what would you call it like a credit a credit line  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2982" display="49:42" %}} - or something there's I'm giving you this because of a promise that has been made so Jesus was yet to come and die but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2992" display="49:52" %}} - because that was a certain thing the Lord granted those uh uh bounds those experiences of him to those who believed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3004" display="50:04" %}} - but in fact that Unity that Binding Together that relationship that was going to be found by the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3013" display="50:13" %}} - coming into us to live in our bodies to share Fellowship in such an intimate fashion with us essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3022" display="50:22" %}} - saying to us you are like you are mine and I am yours that situation was never going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3030" display="50:30" %}} - be a thing in that way unless Jesus had paid the price for our sins and the the way we could know that that that um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3040" display="50:40" %}} - sacrifice had been accepted was that Jesus was going to be glorified that meant he had been restored to the place  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3046" display="50:46" %}} - that he gave up in order to pay that price that is God saying I accepted what you've done and it's wonderful come  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3055" display="50:55" %}} - let's go back to the fellowship we had you know I don't want to get off topic because we don't we don't want to go too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3062" display="51:02" %}} - far field here anyway but um there's this interesting idea in terms of atonement Theory um that's the word used  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3069" display="51:09" %}} - when we're discussing about what exactly is it that God did to reconcile us to himself how were our sins paid for um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3077" display="51:17" %}} - there's this interesting verse um I don't remember exactly I think it's somewhere in Romans that talks about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3083" display="51:23" %}} - you know if if Christ maybe it's not right I don't remember if Christ had not been raised we would have all believed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3088" display="51:28" %}} - for nothing right well if you say well if Christ already died for our sins on the cross wouldn't we have been saved  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3094" display="51:34" %}} - even if he wasn't raised from the dead I don't know if you've ever thought of that um it's one of those things where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3099" display="51:39" %}} - if you if you look at it and you aren't careful with how you phrase your question and how you understand what it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3106" display="51:46" %}} - means the glorification of Christ his the ra his raising from the dead and his Ascension to the father and and sitting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - at his right hand this is God's acceptance of the payment of the Cross right and so um you know God is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3123" display="52:03" %}} - it's not like he couldn't have not accepted it right um in the same way that a just judge would you know render  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3128" display="52:08" %}} - Justice in a case if if a crime had been paid for or whatever um or someone who holds a loan right a just person who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3137" display="52:17" %}} - holds a loan once it is repaid is not going to exact more from the person and so on um but the glorification of Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3145" display="52:25" %}} - is that stamp of approval on the work of the Cross and um just to kind of maybe round out this question a bit more the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3152" display="52:32" %}} - Holy Spirit indwells us after the point of spiritual regeneration once we have become part of the body of Christ we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3160" display="52:40" %}} - you know United with God through the indwelling of the holy spirit that happens on account of what Christ did  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3166" display="52:46" %}} - for us on the cross um so AI mentioned the whole credit thing with the Old Testament Believers um I don't even know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3172" display="52:52" %}} - how profitable it is for us to compare the you know the ministry of the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3177" display="52:57" %}} - upon Believers in the New Testament with the ministry of the Holy Spirit on Believers in the Old Testament I mean we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3181" display="53:01" %}} - know that it's mentioned is having some of these folks having the spirit of God do they have it in the same way that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3188" display="53:08" %}} - have it does it does it really matter you see what I'm saying like I mean like what exactly are the differences Etc is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3196" display="53:16" %}} - that important for understanding I mean like it maybe it's interesting to speculate about but I think the key not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3202" display="53:22" %}} - speculate when you look at Ephesians chapter 4 it's actually pretty straightforward that when he um ascended  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3209" display="53:29" %}} - he gave gifts to men right those gifts did not exist prior I mean yes there were prophets but there were no Apostles  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3217" display="53:37" %}} - there were no Pastor teachers there were Levites who were supposed to interpret the law and even among those Levites  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - they you you saw that it was a special case that you would see that the Holy Spirit came upon someone now consider  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3230" display="53:50" %}} - this fact consider this that Saul first king of well not the first King but still when the when the kingdom was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3237" display="53:57" %}} - established as a thing after Samuel he was the first king um Saul was a Believer right up to the end of his life  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3246" display="54:06" %}} - but there was a point at which the Holy Spirit was taken from him that's a very important difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3253" display="54:13" %}} - between Believers of that time and Believers of today if you don't have the Holy Spirit now in this dispensation in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3261" display="54:21" %}} - this era you're not a Believer any M but he was a Believer who had to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3268" display="54:28" %}} - function without the Holy Spirit and remember Paul David's very stringing cry in in Psalm 53 when he asked the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3277" display="54:37" %}} - not to remove his Spirit from him we have never we Believers have never seen what it is like to love the Lord and not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3286" display="54:46" %}} - have his spirit in us we don't know what that is like it's a horrible existence it's a very painful miserable existence  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3292" display="54:52" %}} - being because this world yeah I just going to say you know I I don't want us to get we we've already talked a good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3299" display="54:59" %}} - bit here um hopefully we've answered the gist of the question I mean I'm sorry to cut you off a bit here sure sure sure I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3304" display="55:04" %}} - have up on the screen here the verse this is exactly what Audi just said this is how we know New Testament that if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3309" display="55:09" %}} - anyone doesn't have the spirit of Christ they're not Believers um Romans 8 uh chapter 8 verse 9 but more what I was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3317" display="55:17" %}} - getting at was it that we can't know certain things about I my point was we don't need to go exercise our minds  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3322" display="55:22" %}} - about what exactly was different you know because one difference like you pointed out is that the spirit could be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3327" display="55:27" %}} - removed like it was removed from Saul and it can't today well that's a difference right but I mean I I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3333" display="55:33" %}} - know how how how how like useful it is to go compare and contrast what their version you know like how having the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3341" display="55:41" %}} - Spirit uh the blessing of the spirit or the anointing of the spirit um as David had for them is different than what all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3348" display="55:48" %}} - believers have now it's just the point is is that regardless for us the spirit was given because of Christ's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3355" display="55:55" %}} - glorification because of the acceptance of his payment that's kind of the the answer to the the underlying question I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3362" display="56:02" %}} - think so let's pause for a sec make sure we we kind of got all the uh points hit on that one so that's where we're going  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3371" display="56:11" %}} - to close out here this conversation about um uh the spirit of God and and how does God have the spirit and is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3378" display="56:18" %}} - different from the Holy Spirit and also why wasn't the Holy Spirit sent um until the Ascension um and now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3385" display="56:25" %}} - turn to discussing the Sevenfold spirit of God as it's mentioned in Revelation so this was kind of where we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3393" display="56:33" %}} - were going to pick up next um in the verse that we were reading in Revelation which we were focusing primarily upon uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3401" display="56:41" %}} - the aspect of three persons of the Trinity mentioned in this verse but one of the questions we had here when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3407" display="56:47" %}} - paused was um we have this mention of the seven spirits who are Before the Throne and this is here in Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3414" display="56:54" %}} - chap 1 1 veres 4-6 um of the seven spirits who are before his throne um and so the question was we kind of had a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3423" display="57:03" %}} - feeling that we recalled other places where we had these sevens come up um they come up in Zechariah Chapter 3  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3431" display="57:11" %}} - Verse n talking about seven eyes on the stone and then in the next chapter as well Zechariah Chapter 4 um several  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - places if we search for the word seven you'll see that it shows up here um and uh as well you know we just went search  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3445" display="57:25" %}} - so if you've never done this before you can actually search for things on ikas specifically using this search parameter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3451" display="57:31" %}} - you know you limit it to the site specifically and yeah verily there was a email question and answer on this and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3458" display="57:38" %}} - um Audi I don't know if you wna you want to give some conversation before um but ichus does talk about this point you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3464" display="57:44" %}} - know it talks about uh this passage here Revelation chapter one where we were um it cross references it with Isaiah 11  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3472" display="57:52" %}} - verse 2 um you know here seven the seven old Spirit of the Lord in Isaiah chapter 2 um and then in Revelation chapter 5 as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3481" display="58:01" %}} - well um yeah um I mean you could actually go to uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3489" display="58:09" %}} - ct2b that particular uh discussion he had there because that's where he went into the discussion but um it suffice to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3497" display="58:17" %}} - say that the seven spirits are not seven spirits they it's it's the Holy Spirit in the seven roles you might say he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3509" display="58:29" %}} - plays or the seven works that he he does so he has seven Ministries it's like how do I you could think of it this way that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3519" display="58:39" %}} - the holy spirit is doing one work one perfect work and in seven different Ministries and Ministry Services as as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3531" display="58:51" %}} - we know uh he he perfects this this work it brings it to Perfection so the the you would see that Revelation starts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3541" display="59:01" %}} - with talking about the seven spirits Before the Throne of God and then proceeds in chapters uh the same chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3548" display="59:08" %}} - one it talks about the seven lamb stands and the seven spirits of the seven churches then in chapters 2 and three it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3556" display="59:16" %}} - talks about the seven churches there's a reason that it's talking about things like this it's referring to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3562" display="59:22" %}} - Perfection of a plan that God has that the spirit is working out so this is what the seven spirits of God is really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3573" display="59:33" %}} - about it's not that there are seven Holy Spirits we should remember what we're talking about we're talking about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3581" display="59:41" %}} - and God is the infinite one you don't need seven of anything of him that's just the fact so we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3590" display="59:50" %}} - seven things that the spirit does to bring his perfect work to fruition not seven Holy Spirits it's not a really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3599" display="59:59" %}} - difficult concept to grasp unless we get often the way Weeds about it it says seven it says seven here and it's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3608" display="01:00:08" %}} - only the only place in the Bible where it actually states that explicitly and in fact in some translations you will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3615" display="01:00:15" %}} - see um the thing written as Sevenfold spirit of God we all have a spiritual appreciation a common sense appreciation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3621" display="01:00:21" %}} - of the fact that we're talking about the Holy Spirit and um as we see from uh Professor Robert's discussion of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3629" display="01:00:29" %}} - and I think this uh Q&A he says what I have up here we had up the Q&A here which links to the part of part 2B of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3639" display="01:00:39" %}} - the coming tribulation which we were at here which talks about the seven lamps of fire showing up in Revelation it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3644" display="01:00:44" %}} - actually also in uh here let me go let me go back it's also also in uh part five of the Bible basic series which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3654" display="01:00:54" %}} - uh the study the the Holy Spirit you'll see there's the section of the sevens here seven spirits lamps eyes seals same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3660" display="01:01:00" %}} - thing if we go back to this this is in that section lots of discussion about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3666" display="01:01:06" %}} - this concept as well so I will probably go ahead and post these links when I post the notes for this week because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3673" display="01:01:13" %}} - these are all good places to look um yeah yeah okay so it's bottom line we're not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3682" display="01:01:22" %}} - talking about multiple spirits of God we're just talking about the um Perfection of the thing that the holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3689" display="01:01:29" %}} - spirit is doing to realize the plan of God that's it the reason the seven is in view is because of what John is about to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3699" display="01:01:39" %}} - teach that's the the point in in Revelation 2 and three we kind of see it because uh the seven churches are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3708" display="01:01:48" %}} - actually seven divides in time of the progression of the church how the church is not really iterating but developing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3718" display="01:01:58" %}} - you could say and in each of these eras so to speak we see the Holy Spirit doing something specific at a specific time in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3727" display="01:02:07" %}} - preparing this Bride for the Lord and remember that the focus of all the work that God is doing before the return of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3738" display="01:02:18" %}} - the Lord Jesus is to replace the angels that rebelled that's the plan he has and what the holy spirit is doing toward  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3747" display="01:02:27" %}} - that is his ministry that's the work he is doing and it's captured in this Sevenfold description that we find in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3755" display="01:02:35" %}} - the Bible that's that's all there is to it yep I think that's a good way so that's where we'll wrap up this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3764" display="01:02:44" %}} - one so last question here from this initial set of questions we had after going through a lot of the scripture uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3772" display="01:02:52" %}} - to bolster the point we were making uh was this question kind of about how uh when we say that we are baptized into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3779" display="01:02:59" %}} - the person of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and Matthew chapter 28 verse 19 in the Great Commission well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3786" display="01:03:06" %}} - what does that mean exactly how can we be put into the person of God if God is divine and has all these attributes as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3793" display="01:03:13" %}} - we talked about in God's Essence before um we are not deity we can never be deity not in the way that God is and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3801" display="01:03:21" %}} - what does it mean for us to become part of the body of Christ Christ um I think let's start off by uh the wrong way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3809" display="01:03:29" %}} - looking at things kind of how we were doing with the Trinity here um so there are certain branches of of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3816" display="01:03:36" %}} - self-professed Christians who talk about us becoming like God being transformed to be like him there's this word in uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3824" display="01:03:44" %}} - particularly Orthodox theology called theosis um you may have heard that um some of this is more or less  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3831" display="01:03:51" %}} - objectionable because we are supposed to be transformed formed uh to follow after our our you know Jesus Christ as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3838" display="01:03:58" %}} - firstborn of the Resurrection we're supposed to reflect his glory so in a certain manner of speaking yes we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3843" display="01:04:03" %}} - going to become like God but not in you know ontological being not in nature um we will only ever be human uh even in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3852" display="01:04:12" %}} - eternity um now uh the book of Hebrews is very clear that uh once humans are resurrected and exalted at least Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3861" display="01:04:21" %}} - as the human Paul goes out of his way well if you take Paul to be the writer of Hebrews which I do U Paul goes out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3867" display="01:04:27" %}} - his way in Hebrews to show how Jesus is superior to the angels um in the resurrection State um but Jesus Is God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3875" display="01:04:35" %}} - we won't be God um so I don't want to ramble um to the the main thrust of this question uh when we are baptized into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3883" display="01:04:43" %}} - the person of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit we are baptized into the body of Christ we become indwell by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3890" display="01:04:50" %}} - Holy Spirit um this metaphor for us as as acting as one body gets to the unity of the church it does not mean somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3899" display="01:04:59" %}} - that we become I don't know this sounds super technical but we don't become like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3905" display="01:05:05" %}} - partakers of the Divine Essence in what some people mean by that um uh by a certain way of description that is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3913" display="01:05:13" %}} - we do as Christians by communion we are washed clean in the blood of Christ through his body and his blood but not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3920" display="01:05:20" %}} - in the way that people talk about that um you know it's not like we live upon I don't know eating the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3927" display="01:05:27" %}} - literal Flesh and Blood of God because people have very wrong ideas about communion and that um so I know I've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3933" display="01:05:33" %}} - gone a lot of different directions a you want to pick up any of the the threads I've introduced here and go with it yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3938" display="01:05:38" %}} - um I think you've really hid the nail on the head because when we think about well we're we're going to be made one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3946" display="01:05:46" %}} - with God but we're not going to become deity how does that make sense well think about marriage for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3951" display="01:05:51" %}} - example um we we become one with our spouse and if the Bible says that it doesn't really matter what anything else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3959" display="01:05:59" %}} - in the world says when you get married you become one with your spouse but the woman does not cease to be a woman and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3968" display="01:06:08" %}} - become a man and the man does not cease to be a man and become a woman we don't lose our personality we don't lose our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3974" display="01:06:14" %}} - makeup we just find ourselves in this very and it it doesn't matter how perfect that relationship is even if it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3981" display="01:06:21" %}} - was Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the the fall we still see that in that position Eve was Eve and Adam was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3992" display="01:06:32" %}} - Adam even though they were one flesh so it's the same thing in our relationship with God when we are brought into this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4001" display="01:06:41" %}} - Unity this Oneness with him we don't become God and we should keep that we should keep in mind that it's impossible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4009" display="01:06:49" %}} - for anything that is not God to become God it's it's impossible plain and simple to be become God because God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4016" display="01:06:56" %}} - that which is that's it it it does not become and it did not used to be it is so we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4027" display="01:07:07" %}} - never become God and God is not never going to be other than God so it's not like God will become us he's always  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4036" display="01:07:16" %}} - going to be God but the thing is we will enter an a perfect intimate relationship with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4044" display="01:07:24" %}} - him where things that he has he can share very freely and fully with us that's this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4053" display="01:07:33" %}} - also where something that I've I've puzzled over for a little while starts to make sense I I thought for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4061" display="01:07:41" %}} - how how does one how does this thing that Paul said that in that day we shall know as we ourselves are are known today  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4071" display="01:07:51" %}} - we see dimly we see darkly as in the Mir era but then we will know as we ourselves are know when you think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4080" display="01:08:00" %}} - that this is actually hinting very strongly as at something that sounds very much like omniscience that is crazy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4090" display="01:08:10" %}} - how could we possibly contain that much information but this is and now I don't want to speculate on what that might  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4098" display="01:08:18" %}} - actually mean in terms of how we possess knowledge of that sort but it will be perfect knowledge is what it is it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4104" display="01:08:24" %}} - actually saying that we possess perfect knowledge but I don't know if it's perfect knowledge of all things or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4109" display="01:08:29" %}} - whatever but we will not have the difficulties that we are having today in understanding what God is about and what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4116" display="01:08:36" %}} - where we are headed with the Lord so here's the question then how do we have that only as a gift from the Lord now  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4125" display="01:08:45" %}} - imagine this that um you were adopted into a home they're very wealthy they have loads of books and they have loads  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4134" display="01:08:54" %}} - of cars and all sorts of things it's all there right now that you've been adopted into that home you have rights to all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4142" display="01:09:02" %}} - that you can pick up anything you want to read you can get in any car and drive you can sit at any table have any meal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4150" display="01:09:10" %}} - you want it's all yours now you have equal rights to it but it doesn't mean that you have ceased to be you and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4158" display="01:09:18" %}} - you've become the people that adopted you or that the people that adopted you cease to be themselves and became you so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4165" display="01:09:25" %}} - it's the same way we can look at this that we have been brought into an intimate relationship with the Lord such  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4172" display="01:09:32" %}} - that he shares himself with us without losing himself or us becoming something other than what we are you know I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4181" display="01:09:41" %}} - I think maybe the best way to get to this and this is kind of what I was trying to put my finger on when I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4186" display="01:09:46" %}} - started was that it's it's a metaphor it's not literal um and and I mean I'm laughing a bit here because this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4194" display="01:09:54" %}} - same problem that people have with the communion passage in John chapter 6 about eating the flesh and blood of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4200" display="01:10:00" %}} - Christ and they say well you see the Bible says is so therefore it must be somehow that we are consuming the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4206" display="01:10:06" %}} - essence of God or whatever you know which we we think is complete nonsense right we are memorialists it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4211" display="01:10:11" %}} - metaphor well so to is us being the body of Christ we are not literally ontologically speaking the body of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4218" display="01:10:18" %}} - Christ whatever but like where people get wrong is by that's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4227" display="01:10:27" %}} - metaphor it's what it's supposed to be we are the you know we are the bride of Christ we're also the body of Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4233" display="01:10:33" %}} - these things are metaphors right um marriage is supposed to teach us about sub uh uh submitting to Christ you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4240" display="01:10:40" %}} - that that is a direct analogy it's one of the reasons why the Bible uses this metaphor it's is very helpful in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4245" display="01:10:45" %}} - structuring our understanding but fundamentally it is a metaphor we are not ontologically speaking the body of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4251" display="01:10:51" %}} - Christ whatever that would mean um the fact that some people go there well I mean they're missing the point that it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4259" display="01:10:59" %}} - not it's not a technical description of God's existence his being that we're talking about here it's how we function  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4267" display="01:11:07" %}} - with that Unity what our relationship to God is um collectively as a group is as a wife properly submits herself to her  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4275" display="01:11:15" %}} - husband in marriage and the husband uh that is Jesus in this analogy uh you know loves his wife in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4281" display="01:11:21" %}} - self-sacrificing way it's supposed to teach us something right but it has nothing to do with about like God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4287" display="01:11:27" %}} - being or us somehow becoming one with God's essence or whatever else people kind of like get up to be right I mean I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4297" display="01:11:37" %}} - will add I will add this to that that um today we understand that we we want as children of God as Christians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4308" display="01:11:48" %}} - those who believe in Jesus Christ to be instruments of God's will that's literally what we want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4314" display="01:11:54" %}} - to be Servants of his will and if he wants things done this way or that that's what we want to do now if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4322" display="01:12:02" %}} - appreciate what that means that is precisely what it means to be the body of Christ we are agents of his will now  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4331" display="01:12:11" %}} - in in the in eternity when we have Resurrection bodies and God has filled all things just as Colossians says the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4341" display="01:12:21" %}} - idea here is that we are in such perfect harmony with God that what we want is aligned with what he wants so that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4352" display="01:12:32" %}} - actions we carry out the interactions we get involved with the way we treat the universe in which we live is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4360" display="01:12:40" %}} - expression of himself so we are not him but we become like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4368" display="01:12:48" %}} - um not just you could think of conscious tools you could you could think think of AI or but AI is a very bad analogy for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4377" display="01:12:57" %}} - this well not a bad analogy it's a good analogy but still it has limits the idea here is that we are conscious creatures  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4385" display="01:13:05" %}} - who are very happy being in ourselves the means of carrying out God's will in the creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4396" display="01:13:16" %}} - that he makes that's what we are trying to do today in our spiritual growth we're learning to align ourselves with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4402" display="01:13:22" %}} - the Lord and walk diligently with him every day that's why the Bible talks about our our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4409" display="01:13:29" %}} - being changed in the way we think so that we become like the Lord in the way we think so that he does not have to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4416" display="01:13:36" %}} - dictate to us as external things for himself but rather that because we are in such close um connection to him the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4426" display="01:13:46" %}} - way he thinks and the way we think are the same so what we want to do is what he wants done and we we become we become  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4435" display="01:13:55" %}} - the conduits the means through which he exercises his will in the creation that he made so this again leads us back to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4444" display="01:14:04" %}} - what Jesus said that he will be in us and we will be in him that's the idea this this very tight connection of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4453" display="01:14:13" %}} - Hearts is essentially what this is how Moses and I mean there was a relationship between Moses and Aaron but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4461" display="01:14:21" %}} - uh just going to to Moses Moses was to do what God Said and he did until yeah did until he didn't and so that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4469" display="01:14:29" %}} - that's the body what you're talking about what Moses was doing in obedience and what Jesus actually was doing in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4476" display="01:14:36" %}} - obedience is the body we we need to be no okay yeah exactly now Jesus in his kosis I would say that is a good way to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4486" display="01:14:46" %}} - look at it um in his divine nature he was always completely United with the father in essence but in his kosis  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4493" display="01:14:53" %}} - Jesus submitting himself perfectly to the father's will is exactly the unity that we're getting at here um I also say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4501" display="01:15:01" %}} - one other point if we are getting hot and bothered about this idea of uh you know us being united with the Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4508" display="01:15:08" %}} - Essence of God well what about the taking it the other way you know this is perhaps an easier more falsifiable thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4515" display="01:15:15" %}} - if we say that we are one body meaning that we are all perfectly United with each other well like just look around a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4523" display="01:15:23" %}} - little bit and you'll see that what some people seem to mean by that can't be true right um yeah because if if we take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4532" display="01:15:32" %}} - this thing as we collectively as a church are the body of Christ whatever whenever people get into making more out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4539" display="01:15:39" %}} - of that than the metaphor it is well in as much as we are one with Christ in that we are also one with each other and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4546" display="01:15:46" %}} - if you just look around I mean sure we as Christians are supposed to be more united than many other people in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4552" display="01:15:52" %}} - world that is a trademark characteristic of the church when it is functioning properly but it is not whatever those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4558" display="01:15:58" %}} - people mean right um so that's very true very true that's a very good test yeah all right well I think that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4568" display="01:16:08" %}} - a good place to leave this um when we are baptized spiritually into the body of Christ you know not the ritual of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4575" display="01:16:15" %}} - water baptism but the the meaning of spiritual baptism such that in Romans 8:9 it says that anyone who does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4581" display="01:16:21" %}} - have the spirit is not of God um what we are getting at is that we are made spiritually alive we have that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4588" display="01:16:28" %}} - connection that the close relationship with God such that we submit to him and we respect his will and he loves us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4596" display="01:16:36" %}} - that self-sacrificing love uh that Jesus laid down his life for us but we have that tightness of connection and also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4603" display="01:16:43" %}} - that Unity with one another in the church all submitting ourselves to Christ that is what we're getting at for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4610" display="01:16:50" %}} - us to be part of the body of Christ um not that we are somehow you know like becoming God or um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4618" display="01:16:58" %}} - you know like linked to God in our being or whatever um you know past what it means for all of us to be created and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4625" display="01:17:05" %}} - dependent upon God for existence but um it it's just that idea of the unity we have with one another and with God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4632" display="01:17:12" %}} - through our submission um right all right well I think that's probably where we'll leave this one um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4641" display="01:17:21" %}} - good questions good discussion here on um clarifying some of the concepts that have come out in these passages as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4648" display="01:17:28" %}} - discuss the Trinity so having spent some time talking through some of the questions we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4657" display="01:17:37" %}} - had after going through initial passages talking about how all the members of the Trinity are deity now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4663" display="01:17:43" %}} - turn and look at some specific passages for each member of the godhead so first we're going to start with the father um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4671" display="01:17:51" %}} - so uh obviously the point of uh this particular lesson that we're going through is that all three members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4677" display="01:17:57" %}} - Trinity are deity all of them are Divine they are all God and so starting with the father uh we're going to look at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4684" display="01:18:04" %}} - some passages uh that kind of establish the Divinity of the father then the Divinity of the Son and the Divinity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4690" display="01:18:10" %}} - the Holy Spirit I'm just to bolster that point that all three members of the Trinity are God so we'll start here in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4699" display="01:18:19" %}} - Matthew chapter 9 or sorry Matthew chapter 6 verse 99 um which says uh this is uh Jesus in The Lord's Prayer  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4706" display="01:18:26" %}} - teaching us how to pray says Our Father who is in heaven Hallowed be your name um should be pretty familiar to most  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4712" display="01:18:32" %}} - Christians I'd think but the point here is that God the father is in heaven he is God right um because beings in heaven  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4721" display="01:18:41" %}} - I mean I suppose we'd say angels are in heaven too but very clearly this is an indirect support for the father being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4728" display="01:18:48" %}} - Divine um the father being God uh so a do you have much to say there I mean I think that one is pretty straightforward  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4735" display="01:18:55" %}} - honestly um yeah like you said pretty straightforward um I think the key thing is our father yeah he is in heaven um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4744" display="01:19:04" %}} - are the Angels but our father and then the next thing is May your name be holy yeah or May the Holiness of your name be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4753" display="01:19:13" %}} - preserved or something of that sort and that is particularly speaking to the uniqueness of his person right now we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4762" display="01:19:22" %}} - talked about this the last couple times but when we talk about God's name the Holy Name Of God you know as in Exodus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4768" display="01:19:28" %}} - chapter 3 that completely gets to God as deity AI has I think done a good job explaining this uh several times we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4777" display="01:19:37" %}} - talked about it is that God is existence right is the very thing that makes him God is that quality of isness and that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4786" display="01:19:46" %}} - the name we're saying is Holy right uh God's God's name God's existence as the being that simply is um so in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4795" display="01:19:55" %}} - the characteristic or quality of deity we might say um that is in fact entirely what is in view  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4802" display="01:20:02" %}} - here yeah we we we should keep in mind too that hot speaks to the fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4810" display="01:20:10" %}} - that God's name is unique that is Holiness is speaking to separateness being aart being not like other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4819" display="01:20:19" %}} - things so this is acknowledgement of the deity of the father yep all right next verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4827" display="01:20:27" %}} - here that Dr lugan bille uses is in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 says yet for us there is but one God comma the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4836" display="01:20:36" %}} - father comma from whom all things and for from whom are all things and we exist for him and one Lord Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4845" display="01:20:45" %}} - by whom are all things and we exist through him um so this is what is in grammar known as apposition um this this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4853" display="01:20:53" %}} - this phrase with commas kind of uh giving another way of re restating the thing that comes directly before it um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4861" display="01:21:01" %}} - so there is but one God the Father you know from whom all things are made like I you literally cannot make this verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4869" display="01:21:09" %}} - say anything other than the father is god um it's what the verse directly says um this is I I should I should interject  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4879" display="01:21:19" %}} - here that of all of the members of the Trinity I think the father is the easiest to support as being God right no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4885" display="01:21:25" %}} - one ever thinks the father isn't god um most heresies in fact I can think of off the top of my head in the past we went  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4892" display="01:21:32" %}} - through several adoptionism for example or aryanism most of them deal with members  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4897" display="01:21:37" %}} - of the Trinity that aren't the father I I can't think of too many heresies off the top of my head where somehow people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4903" display="01:21:43" %}} - think the father isn't god um but nonetheless we're just going through dotting our eyes crossing our tees this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4910" display="01:21:50" %}} - is another Bible verse and I'm sure there's others besides the ones that we're going through that clearly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4916" display="01:21:56" %}} - supports the idea of God the father being deity of being Divine anything to say there Audie or shall we just go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4924" display="01:22:04" %}} - ahead and go on to the next one yeah nothing much to say either I think what you said is exactly right I don't think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4931" display="01:22:11" %}} - there's there's ever a question whether the father is God I mean you could say the father is Jesus you could say the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4938" display="01:22:18" %}} - father is the Holy Spirit you could say the father is the god from whom whom the Holy Spirit and Jesus proceed a lot of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4946" display="01:22:26" %}} - things have been said but I don't know of anyone who has a question about whether the Bible teaches the father is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4952" display="01:22:32" %}} - God it's pretty straightforward so so like you said dotting eyes Crossing teas yeah we just say here are the places  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4960" display="01:22:40" %}} - that the Bible says the father is god well so I I remember we we made this point um introducing this uh Dr lugan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4969" display="01:22:49" %}} - Bill stated and I agreed with him that the trinity is obvious from the Bible right um we spent some time and breath  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4976" display="01:22:56" %}} - discussing how it didn't just come about in the thir Century you know 325 Ad Council of NAA this wasn't like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4983" display="01:23:03" %}} - first time that people had like understood the Trinity from scripture um it's right there it's in the text it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4989" display="01:23:09" %}} - the common sense understanding of of how God is discussed in the New Testament and so what we're doing here is showing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4997" display="01:23:17" %}} - you well here's where you get it right these are some of those passages by which the early believers would have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5002" display="01:23:22" %}} - understood that God is Triune in nature right from the text of the Bible uh we don't need tradition or church councils  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5009" display="01:23:29" %}} - to get this point because the Bible itself teaches it um that just is an important thing for us to keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5015" display="01:23:35" %}} - emphasizing as we go here is that we believe the Trinity not because a council of old men sat and voted about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5022" display="01:23:42" %}} - it but because the Bible teaches it um now a lot of people probably wouldn't say they believe it because of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5029" display="01:23:49" %}} - church councils but I don't know um we just need to be very careful in how we uh uh basically justify our belief in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5038" display="01:23:58" %}} - things because we know that the only true basis for our belief as Christians is scripture itself so-called solos  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5045" display="01:24:05" %}} - scriptura right that's a pretty fundamental Canon for us as Evangelical Protestants you know those are the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5050" display="01:24:10" %}} - labels that people would apply to us um and that's why we're kind of emphasizing this point so all that said uh next one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5059" display="01:24:19" %}} - here in Ephesians chapter 3 um so eans come on I'll click on the more link Ephesians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5067" display="01:24:27" %}} - chapter 3: 14- 15 um so says for this reason I bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5076" display="01:24:36" %}} - Earth deres its name um so you know another pretty clear straightforward um how could every  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5085" display="01:24:45" %}} - family in heaven on Earth derive their name if the father wasn't God it just would not make sense um this one might  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5091" display="01:24:51" %}} - be helpful to get a little bit more context to see what is in view here in Ephesians chapter 3 um so it's Paul  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5100" display="01:25:00" %}} - beginning a prayer here um praying for the Ephesians the church in Ephesus um so uh this isn't quite I don't think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5111" display="01:25:11" %}} - title is quite the right word it is a um uh Paul Paul using this phrase here um as a a description a qualifier of who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5123" display="01:25:23" %}} - we're talking about who God is and particularly how that affects us as humans here um so this isn't the only  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5130" display="01:25:30" %}} - place in scripture where this comes up um reasonably common actually you know for Paul or one of the other Apostles  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5136" display="01:25:36" %}} - you know Peter John writing to be you know God uh who has done this for us or who has affected these things um that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5145" display="01:25:45" %}} - God that's the one we're talking about actually I think pretty commonly comes up as God uh the god of your father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5151" display="01:25:51" %}} - Abraham and Isaac and Jacob right you know that kind of set aside this is the god this is the being we're talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5158" display="01:25:58" %}} - about that sort of thing but here just inferential evidence again that the father whom we are talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5166" display="01:26:06" %}} - about is most certainly god um I mean if if all the family in Heaven and Earth derives its name from him you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5175" display="01:26:15" %}} - know how we have family names that's to speak to his authority over Heaven and Earth so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5183" display="01:26:23" %}} - that is pretty I mean it might not seem immediately apparent to people who are looking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5190" display="01:26:30" %}} - for things to quarrel about but it's a pretty straightforward statement if if all the family in Heaven and Earth is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5198" display="01:26:38" %}} - deriving its name from the father then the father is the head of all this family yeah and that position is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5208" display="01:26:48" %}} - position now I will say that the English words father and family don't seem that related right um but uh you know Lis had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5216" display="01:26:56" %}} - mentioned this earlier when we were talking before the recording today well that is an English problem so to speak  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5223" display="01:27:03" %}} - um in Latin and Greek actually at least those are languages I'm familiar with family is intrinsically tied to the word  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5229" display="01:27:09" %}} - for father so um you know Latin P Patria right um this is what we speak these things are dead related to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5239" display="01:27:19" %}} - each other in the text it's right there um so if hit stronger in Latin and Greek is what I'm saying um this connection  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5246" display="01:27:26" %}} - between God the father and us as his family the family is the members belonging to the father so to speak  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5253" display="01:27:33" %}} - right that's how it works biblically in the biblical understanding of family and when we say that God is our father the F  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5261" display="01:27:41" %}} - the family doesn't exist apart from the father I mean I don't want to get into like philosophy or whatever but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5266" display="01:27:46" %}} - like that is the connection we have to God the Father um it's pretty strong is what I'm saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5272" display="01:27:52" %}} - um can you address can you address the name part of this deres its name aie you want to you want to take that or oh yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5282" display="01:28:02" %}} - okay okay um like I said it's like having a family name um most families are identified somehow like I come from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5291" display="01:28:11" %}} - the AR wo family in fact I come from the Isaac Car World of family so my family deres its name from my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5301" display="01:28:21" %}} - father the larger Clan deres its name from um our patriarch uh like my grandfather and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5311" display="01:28:31" %}} - then we have the Uki Clan which is my great-grandfather and so on and so forth so when we talk about the the derivation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5321" display="01:28:41" %}} - of a name we're saying who is it by whose identity a family is known that is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5329" display="01:28:49" %}} - head of the home the head of the clan and um that is that is God in this in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5338" display="01:28:58" %}} - sense we are Christians that's what the world calls us or called us back in the days of uh Paul in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5347" display="01:29:07" %}} - Antioch but you could call us Believers you could call us followers of Christ you could call us followers of the way  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5355" display="01:29:15" %}} - you call us whatever you will but in the end you're saying we belong to God's family and that is true of the angels as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5364" display="01:29:24" %}} - well and of those who have gone before us so that identity that we possess as members of that family derives from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5375" display="01:29:35" %}} - father and that is actually an argument or a statement of you know presupposed fact it's like well that's obvious since  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5385" display="01:29:45" %}} - he is God I mean I think this gets back to what philosophers would call the uncaused cause or the prime mover you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5394" display="01:29:54" %}} - want to use that word from philosophy you know people get their names from somewhere right and if you think of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5402" display="01:30:02" %}} - human uh the the tree of humanity you know starting with Adam and Eve throughout history um families derive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5410" display="01:30:10" %}} - from you know an initial starting point again after the flood um where Noah and his family survived and repopulated the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5417" display="01:30:17" %}} - Earth well even all of those people didn't come from nowhere they came from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5422" display="01:30:22" %}} - all of existence um and I I mean I don't want to stretch it right this passage is clearly talking about the idea of family  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5431" display="01:30:31" %}} - what does that mean for us to be the family of God right we are not literally like I I don't you know like how uh for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5439" display="01:30:39" %}} - example like baby deer are still deer right well even though we are God's children we are not like baby Gods so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5446" display="01:30:46" %}} - speak um we we are in some ways you know we have the image of God we have choice we are Godlike in our Capac to choose  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5453" display="01:30:53" %}} - but we are not like God in nature um we spent a long time um in kind of the first core part of this series talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5460" display="01:31:00" %}} - about how God is completely separate from everything in creation um but where I'm going with this is that God is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5467" display="01:31:07" %}} - one being who doesn't himself have a father so to speak right the one being from whom all of the other families  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5475" display="01:31:15" %}} - derve um it's the uncaused cause now one thing I wanted to mention here I I I have a a family twist on this as well um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5482" display="01:31:22" %}} - so you've probably heard of last names like Johnson or Jacobson right in my own family I have a lot of relatives from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5489" display="01:31:29" %}} - Norway there is a group of folks on my dad's side who still live in rural Illinois and they are the spencon and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5497" display="01:31:37" %}} - there was someone in my family history named Sven and then his family were Sven and his sons the sons of Sven Svenson um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5506" display="01:31:46" %}} - and so I don't know I I I find it funny because I know it's like my great great grandfather or something his named Sven  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5512" display="01:31:52" %}} - spencon um anyway um that is an example here of the family name being derived from uh uh sort of the the leader of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5522" display="01:32:02" %}} - family um I was that is that helpful Lisa um did we kind of get to the core of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5528" display="01:32:08" %}} - you're asking like why your names coming up here um yeah no I guess I'm still a little fuzzy because it's every family  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5534" display="01:32:14" %}} - it's not just the Believers it's every right in heaven and in Earth and now the the Heavenly they don't marry so they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5541" display="01:32:21" %}} - don't have like cousins and brothers and sisters I would be right I mean we we there's a lot we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5551" display="01:32:31" %}} - don't know about for example how angels are organized um so we know that there are clans of angels um you know the 24  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5557" display="01:32:37" %}} - Elders Before the Throne um Aus talks about in its Systematic Theology part 2A of angels talks about the Angelic  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5564" display="01:32:44" %}} - hierarchies and stuff um this verse like not to I I I don't think we need to go all that far down in the week reads  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5572" display="01:32:52" %}} - there um the verse is getting at that all groups of organizations right everything that we would call a family  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5579" display="01:32:59" %}} - and of course we have a human idea of what that means but all organizations derive back to God um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5587" display="01:33:07" %}} - is the one in whom everything exists everything has been created um I get that with the uh Authority structures  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5596" display="01:33:16" %}} - that he set up you know I think it's Romans that tells us to obey authorities so I can see that that is also implied  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5602" display="01:33:22" %}} - here yeah I think I think that um this passage is actually speaking Yeah I I don't like how the NIV puts it because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5614" display="01:33:34" %}} - um well could you could you take a look at the Greek and tell me what it says exactly please sure let me let me first  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5621" display="01:33:41" %}} - I'll pull up a different translation so this is nasb here says from whom every family in heaven and on Earth derives  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5629" display="01:33:49" %}} - its name I I kind of what I'm curious about is what this word is um so we are looking at Ephesians 3 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5637" display="01:33:57" %}} - 15 Ephesians 35 this is uh site that easily lets you pull up intral linear there are multiple sites  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5646" display="01:34:06" %}} - um Blue Letter Bible is one free online site that quickly lets you pull up an Interlinear or reverse Interlinear here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5654" display="01:34:14" %}} - so we are looking at this verse here so starting here this is in heaven or actually it's in the heavens plural  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5663" display="01:34:23" %}} - stative plural and upon the Earth Earth singular um interestingly article here this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5672" display="01:34:32" %}} - word I'm more interested in the every family part okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5679" display="01:34:39" %}} - so this right here that's the every family um Passa is uh adjective here for all and Patria this is a singular noun  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5691" display="01:34:51" %}} - meaning family so from whom this is this is the relative this is the relative Clause from whom every family in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5701" display="01:35:01" %}} - heavens and upon the Earth and then here's the verb um if if I wanted to say all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5711" display="01:35:11" %}} - family right if I wanted to say all the family in Greek how would I say it so okay this this word here pass pass upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5722" display="01:35:22" %}} - this is the adjective in Greek it can mean all or it can mean every depending on context here let me pull the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5729" display="01:35:29" %}} - adjective um so individually um each every any all um so okay that's precisely why I wanted  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5736" display="01:35:36" %}} - to find out because I don't like those translations now I think it is defensible uh you know not to get too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5742" display="01:35:42" %}} - far off in the interpretive weeds here it is defensible to translate this because it is family singular right it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5748" display="01:35:48" %}} - depends if you distribute this adjective or not um you do you make it each or every or do you make it all or the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5755" display="01:35:55" %}} - because if you were to translate this verse here as from whom the whole family in heaven and on Earth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5762" display="01:36:02" %}} - drives I I actually I see where you're going with this and I think that is probably the better translation there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5768" display="01:36:08" %}} - one single family of God right yeah and it's not it's not every every family on Earth there is just one family is it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5777" display="01:36:17" %}} - the family of see nasby actually footnotes it here um the whole um so if you take it in a Distributive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5783" display="01:36:23" %}} - sense it's every if you take it in a uh you know emphasis of the unity sense it's the whole um and this is why side  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5791" display="01:36:31" %}} - tangent not to get you off the weed this is why translation is tricky business right both of those things are valid  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5799" display="01:36:39" %}} - meanings for that word in Greek which one is meant well that is up for you as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5805" display="01:36:45" %}} - translator now this is why um there is a pretty famous quote from a guy named I think it's tacitus in Latin basically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5813" display="01:36:53" %}} - the translates to English is all translators are traitors um in English we don't have a word that can mean both  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5822" display="01:37:02" %}} - every or the whole like the same word means both we don't have a word that has that connotation both of them so we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5828" display="01:37:08" %}} - to pick one in English you don't have to pick one in Greek because the same word means both things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5836" display="01:37:16" %}} - um go ahead you were gonna say something oh yeah uh I think you're make very solid Arguments for the idea that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5845" display="01:37:25" %}} - um there are multiple uh meanings being held together in that one word so it doesn't have to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5852" display="01:37:32" %}} - be an either or the reason I actually come down pretty strongly on the um the whole or the all the uh family um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5863" display="01:37:43" %}} - interpretation is that um this is where we get yet another  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5872" display="01:37:52" %}} - uh insight into what God is trying is doing what God is accomplishing in creation there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5880" display="01:38:00" %}} - a family that he wants it's his family and as we saw right from Genesis most people wanted their own identity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5889" display="01:38:09" %}} - separate from him and that of course is what led him to or what led to the creation of Israel as a nation and we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5899" display="01:38:19" %}} - know that Israel is the church and the church is Israel and ultimately we are going to be sorted into the family that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5906" display="01:38:26" %}} - is Israel you know and so on and so forth so when Paul says this he is speaking to the God of all believers in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5916" display="01:38:36" %}} - Jesus Christ essentially pointing out that it's both the angels and believing humans who belong to this family who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5927" display="01:38:47" %}} - derive their name that is their identity from this father so he's speaking it's it's kind of again it's not like he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5938" display="01:38:58" %}} - arguing for this is uh this is how the father is God it's more like he's he's making a forgone conclusion man he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5945" display="01:39:05" %}} - obviously God because after all the the the whole family of Believers which is the point of all of creature history  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5955" display="01:39:15" %}} - right derives from him so I I agree you know I I don't think anything we were saying before was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5962" display="01:39:22" %}} - wrong but I would translate this if I pick one in Translation and footnote the other one see that nasb here translated  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5970" display="01:39:30" %}} - is every and footnoted the whole I would translate the whole and footnote every um that's how I would do it because it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5976" display="01:39:36" %}} - makes a lot clearer that point that Audi just made that we're talking about the the definite article family of God which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5985" display="01:39:45" %}} - is composed of both humans and Angels uh the elect you'll hear scripture use that word as well people who chose for god um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5993" display="01:39:53" %}} - in who we have our identity um we derive our name we derive our identity from being part of that family the Eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6003" display="01:40:03" %}} - family self- selecting for god um so I really would rather we not go ahead I like it thank you you got it okay yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6014" display="01:40:14" %}} - uh let's go back to the passages we're talking about um so that we say at least mostly on topic here um so um we here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6025" display="01:40:25" %}} - have now covered several passages supporting um the oops wrong side of slides here supporting the Divinity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6032" display="01:40:32" %}} - God the father and like Audi said um you know we did a tangent a little bit there it was a good question I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6038" display="01:40:38" %}} - discouraging questions um but the reason why we were talking about this verse um uh aie said something to the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6045" display="01:40:45" %}} - Paul wasn't using this particular thing as an argument to prove God's deity like that's not the point of this passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6052" display="01:40:52" %}} - this is completely a tangential aside I mentioned it's kind of similar how uh people when referencing God will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6058" display="01:40:58" %}} - reference you know God the the father of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob it's like that it's just in a side of this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6066" display="01:41:06" %}} - God we serve and this God we serve is from whom the whole family of God deres its name um it's just that's who we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6074" display="01:41:14" %}} - talking about here so Paul very much takes it for granted that the father is Divine and eternal and you know the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6084" display="01:41:24" %}} - person from whom we all self-organize into the family of God like it's just it's he's not proving it he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6091" display="01:41:31" %}} - arguing for it it's just taking as brute fact um that was ai's point and I think that is the right way to look at this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6097" display="01:41:37" %}} - passage all right any closing thoughts here on this idea of God the father being god um not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6106" display="01:41:46" %}} - really I think I think you satisfied the point in the the discussion quite well and to be very clear like we said this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6114" display="01:41:54" %}} - is the easy one so to speak um people throughout history do not get tripped up by thinking that somehow God the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6121" display="01:42:01" %}} - is not God um or that he's not deity he's not Divine um it's the other members of the Trinity which have had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6128" display="01:42:08" %}} - more heresy traditionally in trinitarian theology so we will now turn to talk about the sun next and then we'll get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6135" display="01:42:15" %}} - the Holy Spirit after that next we're going to be talking about the Divinity of the Sun so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6144" display="01:42:24" %}} - second member of the Trinity here and just like the first one going to go ahead and be uh reading uh some verses  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6151" display="01:42:31" %}} - here to support this um one uh passage that really comes to mind you see this is the uh the verse used uh you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6158" display="01:42:38" %}} - kind of on the slide itself or in the in the study itself is in John chapter 1 uh the word becoming flesh and dwelling  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6165" display="01:42:45" %}} - Among Us the Incarnation of the word the Divine logos who we know is the son um because through him all things were made  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6174" display="01:42:54" %}} - going back here looking at this um uh this passage from 1 Corinthians chapter 8 that we just talked about you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6181" display="01:43:01" %}} - where this passage does say very clearly that the father is God you know just says it straight out but also talks  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6187" display="01:43:07" %}} - about how um in you know by whom are all things all things were made through him you'll see that used other places in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6195" display="01:43:15" %}} - scripture well that's what John chapter 1 says the Gospel of John the very beginning part of the go goel of John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6201" display="01:43:21" %}} - says that the world was made through him second member of the Trinity the agent Jesus Christ um he is the Divine log us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6209" display="01:43:29" %}} - he is the word this same one was present with the father in the beginning or was present with God in the beginning  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6216" display="01:43:36" %}} - talking about God the Father Here in context of this passage now of course there are people who they don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6223" display="01:43:43" %}} - translate this passage correctly right we got into a little bit about translation in our previous discussion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6229" display="01:43:49" %}} - just now about how um you know different words in Greek maybe we don't have an exact English  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6235" display="01:43:55" %}} - equivalent for the word and so you have to pick translating it one way or the other way well commonly in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6240" display="01:44:00" %}} - particular passage in John chapter 1 uh there's this thing called a definite article which is where we put the God so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6246" display="01:44:06" %}} - people will say Jesus is not God as in the god definite article he is a God uh group of people who does this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6253" display="01:44:13" %}} - Jehovah's Witnesses or jws well so happens that I'm not going to get into the the specifics of GR  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6261" display="01:44:21" %}} - but obviously we're talking about God the Father here um in context um they are a group of people who don't think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6269" display="01:44:29" %}} - that but they like their interpretation of this passage is heavily colored by presupposing that somehow Jesus isn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6275" display="01:44:35" %}} - God this is not the only place in the Bible too um so log rambley preface aside this passage here in John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6281" display="01:44:41" %}} - 1 this is the second person of the Trinity this is who we are talking about uh through him was the world made right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6289" display="01:44:49" %}} - I mean he was God in his own right you know obviously this translation we have up on the screen this comes from ichus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6295" display="01:44:55" %}} - what you see in Brackets is not present in the original Greek these are words or phrases that Dr lugan bill has added  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6302" display="01:45:02" %}} - that he views as implied and this is clarifying the meaning of this passage now if you read these verses with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6308" display="01:45:08" %}} - added bits the things in Brackets it becomes very very clear what the text is saying um if you read the Greek without  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6314" display="01:45:14" %}} - this or the English which comes from the Greek without this it's not maybe quite as clear but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6320" display="01:45:20" %}} - this is what the text means when we interpret it properly so some of those other passages this is why I say it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6326" display="01:45:26" %}} - doesn't rest upon this one alone that talk about Jesus being god um we'll start with uh John 5 Verse 18 here um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6339" display="01:45:39" %}} - this is a pretty clear assertion in the gospels in John chapter 5 the Jews were seeking to kill him because he was not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6347" display="01:45:47" %}} - only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own father making himself equal with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6353" display="01:45:53" %}} - God now this is a report but people were seeking to kill him because Jesus was claiming God as his own father making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6363" display="01:46:03" %}} - himself equal to God now if you read the words in the gospels you see this too but you know uh it's what Jesus claimed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6372" display="01:46:12" %}} - um with his own mouth and uh just as an aside from a argument for probability Jesus wouldn't be making this argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6380" display="01:46:20" %}} - wouldn't be putting himself equal to the father I don't know to like gain followers or something um you know so if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6386" display="01:46:26" %}} - you think about where's the motive in it if Jesus were lying about this he got crucified essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6394" display="01:46:34" %}} - because of this because he claimed to be the Son of God remember a you uh pilate put up on the gravestone you know here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6400" display="01:46:40" %}} - lies the king of the Jews and the Pharisees got really angry and they said no he's not he says he's the king of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6406" display="01:46:46" %}} - Jews right um well this gets to that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God he claimed that you know he and the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6414" display="01:46:54" %}} - were one that's another verse that we'll get to and it made no sense for him to claim that unless he actually was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6421" display="01:47:01" %}} - because if he was trying to claim that to get money or power or fame what it got him instead was it got him crucified  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6428" display="01:47:08" %}} - so that is not a good argument um anything to say here on this point aie um this passage in John 5 and just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6436" display="01:47:16" %}} - generally speaking Jesus claiming to be the Son of God and equal to the father just in his words and the gospels  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6443" display="01:47:23" %}} - generally yeah this is this is actually a passage that uh most people I have run into who have debated uh me on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6453" display="01:47:33" %}} - matter seem to have issues believing I mean how is claiming to be the Son of God making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6462" display="01:47:42" %}} - himself equal to God is is a person equal to his father simply because he is his father's son but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6471" display="01:47:51" %}} - but the point here is that the two are of a kind and then you think again about how how prophecy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6482" display="01:48:02" %}} - Works they knew that what he was saying was that he had come from God so that meant that he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6495" display="01:48:15" %}} - essentially claiming to be the Savior who was I I don't think I remember the passage well it's in Isaiah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6504" display="01:48:24" %}} - where he said I am God your savior your only savior something of that sort I'll try to remember it but my brain is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6511" display="01:48:31" %}} - glitching a bit so the idea here is if he was from God he was the Christ and the Christ was weird he was not a normal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6522" display="01:48:42" %}} - person by their estimation that was why um the disciples I believe it was Peter who said it uh said uh well we know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6532" display="01:48:52" %}} - when the Christ comes oh maybe it wasn't the disciples when the Christ comes he will remain forever that is he will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6538" display="01:48:58" %}} - continue forever because he's not supposed to die he's he's not like the rest of us who who are subject to death  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6546" display="01:49:06" %}} - they didn't see death happening to the to the Christ the Messiah because he had to be God or something very like God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6556" display="01:49:16" %}} - now Jesus was claiming to be from God that's the idea of being the Son of God he Pro he came from God just like a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6565" display="01:49:25" %}} - man would come from his father right well and it helps to appreciate uh the term that Dr Lugo commonly uses for this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6573" display="01:49:33" %}} - is prophetic foreshortening the idea is the perspective like artists might have this if you have a mountain range you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6581" display="01:49:41" %}} - only see the first mountain in the range you can't see the ones behind it right this getting to the suffering servants  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6588" display="01:49:48" %}} - versus the Conquering King thing all of the people at the time when Jesus came were waiting for the king to come  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6594" display="01:49:54" %}} - in and kick out the Romans but instead they got the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 and so you may hear this kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6602" display="01:50:02" %}} - poetically phrase stumbling over the cross when reaching for the crown right um for the Jews they didn't want their  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6610" display="01:50:10" %}} - Messiah to get crucified they wanted their Messiah to go beat the Romans right um sorry I don't want to get off  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6616" display="01:50:16" %}} - on a tangent but it's very interesting point of Prophecy here um and it does characterize what Jesus was claiming um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6624" display="01:50:24" %}} - like Audi was saying he was claiming to be the Messiah the Christ and exactly what the Jews of the first century  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6630" display="01:50:30" %}} - understood that claim to mean we are you have to understand we are culturally removed from this as well right um we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6638" display="01:50:38" %}} - aren't under the oppression of Rome for one thing but we are also not culturally Jewish we didn't grow up hearing you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6646" display="01:50:46" %}} - know stories read about the Messiah as you know the the person come to rescue our people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6653" display="01:50:53" %}} - specifically um this is one of the things that will make the regathering of Israel so powerful during the end times  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6660" display="01:51:00" %}} - is that the the witnesses the 144,000 the Revelation mentioned are for God's family for Israel eological Israel we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6668" display="01:51:08" %}} - are God's family now as Believers you know Israel and the church are one like Audi said Romans chapter 11 for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6674" display="01:51:14" %}} - um but it is strong stuff what Jesus was claiming when he said he was the Messiah um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6680" display="01:51:20" %}} - and you know so that point that aie made here about how is claiming that God is his father making himself equal to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6687" display="01:51:27" %}} - it is as AI said it's because he's saying this is where I am from um God sent me um that is the claim here uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6697" display="01:51:37" %}} - know and actually it's interestingly um you may hear this phrase in the New Testament kind of like um you know is is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6703" display="01:51:43" %}} - he of God or is he of his father the devil you know the uh Pharisees would say he was doing his Signs by the power  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6712" display="01:51:52" %}} - of Satan right um you know let me actually I I don't I I'm trying to think of the verse right off the top about his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6719" display="01:51:59" %}} - father there's a very specific verse I'm thinking of um so this is Jesus talking about how Satan is a liar and the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6727" display="01:52:07" %}} - of Lies devil um let's John 8:44 I I'm thinking of it people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6736" display="01:52:16" %}} - accusing Jesus of having his power come from sat um do you know what I'm talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6742" display="01:52:22" %}} - aie um or am I just yeah I do um yeah um he Stephen is it is it the one where um Jesus replies to them that Satan can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6755" display="01:52:35" %}} - drive out Satan is that right right right right right well that's not quite I want that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6765" display="01:52:45" %}} - context here let's try Matthew 12 so it's Matthew 122 27 or Luke 11:15 also Mark 3 yeah 2 to 27 I believe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6780" display="01:53:00" %}} - yeah so yeah okay maybe maybe it doesn't have the word father there I thought it did um by Prince demons  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6791" display="01:53:11" %}} - but you know like the idea being that if Jesus were sent from Satan he would be employing Satan's power he'd be an agent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6797" display="01:53:17" %}} - of Satan more or less and this is the opposite of who Jesus actually is right but it was kind of it was kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6806" display="01:53:26" %}} - driving home the point that to the interlocutors being sent by the person being an emissary um you know this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6814" display="01:53:34" %}} - another thing that boy we just have a hard time with the language here in English in our culture um you know in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6820" display="01:53:40" %}} - the Gospel of John how how you have all this stuff about Witnesses and Jesus goes on and on about how he was sent and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6828" display="01:53:48" %}} - the one who sent him do you know what I'm talking about and like it seems kind of strange to us reading this in English  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6834" display="01:53:54" %}} - like why is he why is he saying this why is he emphasizing this point and the reason why he is is because of what that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6841" display="01:54:01" %}} - claim means um so in English we'd be like you know if I I don't know like let's say I have a you know like a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6850" display="01:54:10" %}} - young boy who's running an errand for me you know I gave him money I say hey go buy me bread and milk at the grocery  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6854" display="01:54:14" %}} - store or something right he's been sent by me that is not the sense that Jesus means when he's sent by the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6862" display="01:54:22" %}} - right he's not he's not like an errand boy he is an emissary the very boy you know like best I I can't think of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6869" display="01:54:29" %}} - putting it better than Hebrews chapter one right um God's you know like in these last days he's spoken to us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6877" display="01:54:37" %}} - through his son right this is the son is the radiance of God's glory the exact representation of his being sustaining  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6884" display="01:54:44" %}} - all things through his powerful word it's the Emissary of God's power right it is not Jesus as Aaron boy it is Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6893" display="01:54:53" %}} - as the standing for the deity of the father um I know AI has made the point that within the Trinity which we'll get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6900" display="01:55:00" %}} - to a little bit further on in the study the father is seen as the representation of deity within the godhead Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6909" display="01:55:09" %}} - that deity represented to us upon Earth as the messenger um but it is the messenger carrying the scepter of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6916" display="01:55:16" %}} - king so to speak not like an under um so I don't want to ramble but this is important stuff in on on on Luke 11  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6926" display="01:55:26" %}} - verse2 it said but if I cast out demons with the Finger of God surely the kingdom of God has come upon you right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6933" display="01:55:33" %}} - you said Luke 11:20 or 20111 1120 okay yeah I flip the references there mine's NK nkjv on mine yeah I think that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6945" display="01:55:45" %}} - parallel passage to the one that we were we were looking at in Matthew chapter 12 right all right anything else you want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6953" display="01:55:53" %}} - to you want to say aie um I mean I I I do think the language of sent and being sent and the one who sent me um we could  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6960" display="01:56:00" %}} - go look at some references in the Gospel of John uh to examine that concept but it's very interesting and it gets to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6966" display="01:56:06" %}} - this point of what Jesus is claiming when he says he was sent by the father as the Son of God um yeah I I think uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6976" display="01:56:16" %}} - that's um that word was they like like we said they knew exactly what he meant to us today it would be a bit ridiculous  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6984" display="01:56:24" %}} - but they knew what he was saying because I mean while they in Jewish system they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6994" display="01:56:34" %}} - would have understood that we ultimately come from God because he made us they also knew that the Angels could be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7002" display="01:56:42" %}} - called sons of God in the sense of their activity on behalf of God and their power and the domains and spheres of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7011" display="01:56:51" %}} - authori that they maintained for God but this one was not a son of God he claimed to be the Son of God the one who was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7023" display="01:57:03" %}} - true representation of the father's will so like they they knew what it meant they knew we today it's not really the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7032" display="01:57:12" %}} - way we think but it was the way they thought and they knew the the scriptures they knew prophecy they knew exactly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7039" display="01:57:19" %}} - what he how about the definite article Angel of the Lord from the New Testament or sorry  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7044" display="01:57:24" %}} - from the Old Testament it's the same thing um why shall we say cultural implication what he was claiming was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7051" display="01:57:31" %}} - clear so that to tie us back into the QED here so that when Jesus called God his father that's why they equated it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7061" display="01:57:41" %}} - context in cultural context they read between the lines and know and they knew that that claim was that he was equal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7067" display="01:57:47" %}} - with god um that's why the things are equivalent sorry we take a little bit of a round about path to get there but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7074" display="01:57:54" %}} - that's this verse um all right next one we're g to look at um John chapter 10 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7083" display="01:58:03" %}} - 30 pretty straightforward I and the father are one right Jesus claims it as well it's not like we just have to read  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7092" display="01:58:12" %}} - between the lines um so uh recall that we had just estblished that the father is God and if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7101" display="01:58:21" %}} - Jesus says that he is one with the father then Jesus Is God too that's how that works logic wise um so this is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7109" display="01:58:29" %}} - well beyond what a a typical Prophet would have said right sure I mean we would say that folks like let's say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7117" display="01:58:37" %}} - famous Old Testament prophets Elijah Samuel maybe they were given the words of God but what we mean by that is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7126" display="01:58:46" %}} - equivalent to them being God or basically they can't act like as if they have the authority of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7132" display="01:58:52" %}} - God they have not been delegated that Authority right so you might think about this of uh in Warfare times and places  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7140" display="01:59:00" %}} - throughout history the king might send an emissary a representative to conduct like an alliance for example with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7148" display="01:59:08" %}} - someone that person is acting with the authority of the King right but not every messenger has the authority of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7156" display="01:59:16" %}} - king see what I'm saying um there's this there's this sense of who is the represent in fact it's even stronger  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7163" display="01:59:23" %}} - than that in the parable of the vineyard you remember how the owner of the vineyard sends people to try to reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7171" display="01:59:31" %}} - with the tenants and then they they kill these people and then he sends his son saying certainly they will listen to my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7177" display="01:59:37" %}} - son right we have this idea of the son being literally the family representative right um you know in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7187" display="01:59:47" %}} - way that that people who simp simply work for you or not you know God sent his one and only son to us that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7194" display="01:59:54" %}} - stronger than God sending a beloved servant to us right although the Bible is very clear that Jesus perfectly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7200" display="02:00:00" %}} - followed the father's will right that that adopted kenosis Etc um you know like the Jesus's status as fully  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7209" display="02:00:09" %}} - submitting to the father's will but the point is is that Jesus had this Authority he was the representative of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7217" display="02:00:17" %}} - the father um yeah the full representation of the father's Authority they knew they knew um um in this case I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7227" display="02:00:27" %}} - and the father are one um whatever you think of the father is applicable to me whatever you do to me you do to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7235" display="02:00:35" %}} - father they knew precisely what he was saying that's why they tried to Stone him Jesus made the the claims based on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7242" display="02:00:42" %}} - this other places where anyone who Rejects My Testimony rejects the father's testimony right again again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7249" display="02:00:49" %}} - Gospel of John uses this language a lot um when Jesus says that it's because he has been given the authority right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7257" display="02:00:57" %}} - that's that's why he says this is because his words carry the very weight of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7263" display="02:01:03" %}} - God uh you know to use a close contrast I mentioned the Old Testament prophets Lisa had asked well this is definitely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7270" display="02:01:10" %}} - stronger than just the prophets right consider uh the John the Baptist um you know we use this phrase sent from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7279" display="02:01:19" %}} - you know this was something that the Pharisees went you know they were afraid that the people thought that John had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7284" display="02:01:24" %}} - been sent by God right this comes up in the gospels and so was John the Baptist asking or operating on God's power the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7291" display="02:01:31" %}} - answer to that question is yes of course but he was not the Messiah you know in fact John the Baptist goes well out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7298" display="02:01:38" %}} - his way to make that clear I am not even worthy to untie his sandals right um that's the difference in yeah St so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7309" display="02:01:49" %}} - speak of those we talking about yeah good stuff so next one um also John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7318" display="02:01:58" %}} - chapter 10 ver 33 you know this is making it very clear that Jesus was claiming to be God um you know if they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7328" display="02:02:08" %}} - were stoning him and he wasn't actually saying this he would have been like wait hold up guys um well I mean I say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7335" display="02:02:15" %}} - but there are other places like in John chapter 6 where he talks about eating his flesh and drinking his blood where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7340" display="02:02:20" %}} - everyone takes him completely the wrong way and he doesn't correct them right because the idea is people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7346" display="02:02:26" %}} - actually interested will ask what it means rather than just assuming and picking up Stones um but Jesus really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7353" display="02:02:33" %}} - did claim to be God as the thing um and so you know just another verse making it very clear that that's what everyone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7362" display="02:02:42" %}} - understood this to be um it it it wasn't like they got this out of nowhere right um that they were picking up stones to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7372" display="02:02:52" %}} - Stone him for his claims of being one with the father making himself out to be equal to God just like that they like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7379" display="02:02:59" %}} - they got them all wrong basically and that's why they were doing this right um now of course you know we don't want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7385" display="02:03:05" %}} - get too reductionistic in it but they knew this in a way that maybe like we've been saying isn't as so clear to us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7391" display="02:03:11" %}} - our cultural context but it is very much what Jesus was claiming um yeah and they understood it as such  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7400" display="02:03:20" %}} - um yeah and so basically the testimony of the of the actions of the Jews was to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7408" display="02:03:28" %}} - say we know what you're saying and we reject it and those of us today who go well um he didn't say it that's how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7416" display="02:03:36" %}} - understood it and they were wrong in understanding it that way but kind of missing the point I I I don't know if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7423" display="02:03:43" %}} - you guys know but there are people who are making an issue that um Jesus never claimed to be God in any part of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7431" display="02:03:51" %}} - scriptures well uh this was one of those places where he did make that claim and when they made this accusation against  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7440" display="02:04:00" %}} - him that he was claiming to be God his response was not oh you got that wrong I wasn't making that claim but he actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7448" display="02:04:08" %}} - told them well if the scriptures call those to whom the word of the Lord came Gods because you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7457" display="02:04:17" %}} - the scriptures say are Gods he says how much more the one whom the father has Sanctified set apart for himself the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7466" display="02:04:26" %}} - who is not like any other human this is I will tell you this is one of those things where it is the hardness of heart  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7473" display="02:04:33" %}} - that God gives us so much room to reject him because all these people are like like come on man just answer the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7481" display="02:04:41" %}} - question are you God yes or no and Jesus says for the Bible says ye are gods and how much more you see what I'm saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7488" display="02:04:48" %}} - like he doesn't answer yes or no um and he he does this on purpose though um this is the rhetorical strategy of Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7498" display="02:04:58" %}} - so to speak um he answers this he doesn't say it like that because it is supposed to get us to think about what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7508" display="02:05:08" %}} - this means to give people that opportunity to turn away um so yeah and and and even even further he did tell  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7516" display="02:05:16" %}} - them that he was God he told them I am the father or one you know this is actually it's it's the same the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7524" display="02:05:24" %}} - chapter this is the same two two verses before um yeah yeah he had told them I am the father of one and they picked up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7533" display="02:05:33" %}} - stones to Stone him and he asked them what did I do which good work are you stoning me for not for a good work it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7540" display="02:05:40" %}} - because you're claiming to be God well why is that a problem when God calls some of you Gods to whom the word of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7549" display="02:05:49" %}} - came I mean if he could call some of you Gods how much more the one whom he has set apart for himself the one who is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7557" display="02:05:57" %}} - unique among all human beings that will ever exist right this was one person of all the mass of humanity that God had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7566" display="02:06:06" %}} - set apart for himself there was no one like Jesus Christ before him and there will never be anyone like Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7573" display="02:06:13" %}} - after him this was the one person who was both God and man at the same time that's what was actually saying it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7580" display="02:06:20" %}} - very clear like actually this reading this passage together right these two verses Dr lugan is citing them you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7586" display="02:06:26" %}} - one after the other here but this passage they were stoning him because they said that it was blasphemy that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7592" display="02:06:32" %}} - was claiming to be like it is that's what that claim says Jesus said that that's what they thought it meant that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7597" display="02:06:37" %}} - is what it meant right exactly exactly exactly and of course I love I love the way that Jesus phrases this right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7606" display="02:06:46" %}} - they pick up stones to Stone him and he ask for which good thing I've done are you starting me um you know it is uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7614" display="02:06:54" %}} - yeah try but you know um anyway um John chapter 10 real clear right um next one we're gonna look at Romans chapter 9  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7626" display="02:07:06" %}} - verse 5 right this one's a little bit harder um I don't know how well this comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7634" display="02:07:14" %}} - through in the English but um who's are you know here let me I'm going go look at the full context  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7641" display="02:07:21" %}} - here Romans nine it's talking about Israel yeah being yeah but this this version let's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7651" display="02:07:31" %}} - see this is NIV um let's see what what version did we pick it up is nasb 95 probably a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7657" display="02:07:37" %}} - little bit more literal here it's probably closer to what the Greek says but NIV brings out the meaning more here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7664" display="02:07:44" %}} - that they're saying that the Messiah is God right um like this is is a I can actually check here if there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7671" display="02:07:51" %}} - relative pronoun in the Greek um let's check it's Romans but I'm just curious that's all um yeah so it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7682" display="02:08:02" %}} - depends what you take the antecedent of this pronoun to be right here so this is the Greek relative pronoun ha which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7688" display="02:08:08" %}} - we would translate in English as who it's called a relative pronoun it starts a relative Clause right uh relative  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7695" display="02:08:15" %}} - pronouns have what are called antecedents that means they point to something that came before um and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7702" display="02:08:22" %}} - question here is what does it point to well this noun right here hristos this is the Messiah Christ right um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7713" display="02:08:33" %}} - something along the lines of um Christ you know according to the flesh right who pointing back to Christ is how you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7722" display="02:08:42" %}} - should translate this this is where the relative pronoun points to which means this text I you know I Sor I don't want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7729" display="02:08:49" %}} - to get super technical there but the point is that this translation when the NIV here translates that the Messiah is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7734" display="02:08:54" %}} - the antecedent of this relative pronoun so that s we saying that Messiah is God that is the correct way to translate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7740" display="02:09:00" %}} - this um so yeah yeah and again that's not the point of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7750" display="02:09:10" %}} - this passage it's just there um you know like a just an aside about the Messiah the Messiah who is the messiah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7758" display="02:09:18" %}} - God overall um and Jesus claimed to be the Messiah therefore Jesus claimed to be God read yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7767" display="02:09:27" %}} - exactly all right 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 this is this one we saw the last time  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7775" display="02:09:35" %}} - too we said from whom all things exist and we exist for him that's the father and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7783" display="02:09:43" %}} - all things it's what we were talking about in John chapter 1 and we exist through through him we exist for the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7790" display="02:09:50" %}} - father exist through Christ you know clear reference here to John chapter 1 um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7796" display="02:09:56" %}} - yeah yeah yeah so just as all things um sorry what was that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7806" display="02:10:06" %}} - passage again sorry uh 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 yeah just as all things all things exist for the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7816" display="02:10:16" %}} - and from the father all things exist by Jesus Christ and through through him so that's that's quite an equation to me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7827" display="02:10:27" %}} - yeah and like I said I in my mind this is a very clear reference to the agency of the Sun in creation um right if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7836" display="02:10:36" %}} - say in whom when Paul says in whom all things hold together other places in in the Bible we kind of get the sense that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7842" display="02:10:42" %}} - he has the father in mind there but we know that Jesus Christ is said to be the agent in creation it's what John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7850" display="02:10:50" %}} - 1 says um yeah yeah yeah all right Colossians chapter 2 verse 9 I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7861" display="02:11:01" %}} - know this is why I'm chuckling I don't know how people somehow don't believe this right um just just read it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7870" display="02:11:10" %}} - Colossians 2 verse 9 talking about Jesus Christ here by the way for in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7877" display="02:11:17" %}} - form I mean like that's what we're talking about right um yeah yeah the fullness of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7887" display="02:11:27" %}} - deity that means he's God yes I mean like how else let me ask you people who oppose the deity of Christ what else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7897" display="02:11:37" %}} - does this passage mean if not that Jesus is god um you know and I'm sure they have their they have their their the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7904" display="02:11:44" %}} - ways in which they twist scripture to make it not so right I mentioned the Jehovah's Witnesses in John chapter one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7910" display="02:11:50" %}} - earlier squabbling over the definite article when it's very clear that the passage says that Jesus is god um so too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7916" display="02:11:56" %}} - here I'm sure people have their arguments all of which are complete rubbish I'm sure but this verse says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7923" display="02:12:03" %}} - that Jesus is god um full stop end of story um or we could look at a bit more of the context it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7932" display="02:12:12" %}} - confusing yeah I mean a lot of what we're reading doesn't require this is actually one Reon that the Trinity the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7939" display="02:12:19" %}} - the the teaching of the Trinity is not really that advanced it's not even an advanced Doctrine it's not something we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7946" display="02:12:26" %}} - need to you know know so much to understand it's pretty straightforward all of these things are claims that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7953" display="02:12:33" %}} - Bible is making explicitly about the members of the Trinity how each of them are God in this particular case um um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7963" display="02:12:43" %}} - sorry I I need to see that passage again uh we are in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 it's right here says for in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7972" display="02:12:52" %}} - Christ all the fullness of the deity Liv for yeah that's that's just not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7981" display="02:13:01" %}} - experience anyone else has this is unique to Christ that the fullness that is everything that is deity everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7989" display="02:13:09" %}} - that is deity lived in a bodily form it was well not contained but it was fully expressed right well this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7999" display="02:13:19" %}} - is theology terms which we'll get to probably if we did if we ever get to christology we we'll get to this it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8006" display="02:13:26" %}} - called the hypostatic Union right um that's the theological jargon for fully God yet fully man how does that work  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8016" display="02:13:36" %}} - it's what that teaching is about yes important I heard this girl say that um one time somebody asked her about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8025" display="02:13:45" %}} - and she said well if you've seen me you've seen my father and she was going off the you know that the spirit of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8033" display="02:13:53" %}} - dwells in her as a Believer but this is very different and that was wrong for her to claim  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8040" display="02:14:00" %}} - that I mean here's how I view it first Corinthians I think second Corinthians chapter 3 talks about us reflecting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8046" display="02:14:06" %}} - God's glory we mirrors right Jesus Christ was not a mirror he radiated God's glory actively see the difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8055" display="02:14:15" %}} - we reflect he radiates completely different things I don't know if that's a helpful analogy but um yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8062" display="02:14:22" %}} - you know like Jesus Christ is a light source we merely reflect light those are two completely different things um like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8070" display="02:14:30" %}} - Moon does the sun right good analogy too um but yeah you you're we are correct when we say that the fullness of deity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8080" display="02:14:40" %}} - living in bodily form for no one else does the fullness of De live in bodily form right that's not what it means for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8086" display="02:14:46" %}} - us to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit that's not what this is getting at this is getting at the second member of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8092" display="02:14:52" %}} - Trinity taking on flesh becoming a human being to die for us that's what we're talking about here um all right one more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8102" display="02:15:02" %}} - and good stuff yeah um Hebrews chapter 1 verse3 I think I quoted this before right this is talking about Jesus being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8110" display="02:15:10" %}} - God's last message to humanity I love Hebrews chapter 1 um these first few verses of Hebrews are some of my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8116" display="02:15:16" %}} - favorite just because of how strong they are this is the epicness of human history if you will right so we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8122" display="02:15:22" %}} - speaking of Jesus and why God sent him and he says he is the radiance of his glory his being God God's glory and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8129" display="02:15:29" %}} - exact representation of his nature and upholds all things by the word of his power when he had made purification of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8136" display="02:15:36" %}} - sins he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high so words here exact representation of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8145" display="02:15:45" %}} - nature this is another thing that is quote unquote Jesus only so to speak right we as human beings are indwelt by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8153" display="02:15:53" %}} - the Holy Spirit but we are not the exact representation of God's nature right um so and actually you know that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8162" display="02:16:02" %}} - that metaphor where we just using about Jesus radiating the glory of God and US reflecting the glory of God look at this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8169" display="02:16:09" %}} - right here says Jesus is the radiance of his glory let me pull that passage up from 2  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8176" display="02:16:16" %}} - Corinthians chapter I think this is talking about like the veil in Moses as well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8182" display="02:16:22" %}} - um uh you know we talked about this when we were talking about lightting Glory right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8188" display="02:16:28" %}} - um I don't know if this there's another passage I think that talks about going from glory to glory maybe that's here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8194" display="02:16:34" %}} - anyway point being Jesus is the radiance of the glory of God um the radiance of his glory that is different than us um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8205" display="02:16:45" %}} - Jesus here is expressely said you know we could go look at like I said I love Hebrews chapter 1 um but he's explicitly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8212" display="02:16:52" %}} - said you know first off to be sent by go oops Hebrews 1 not 11 um right now actually verse two very good reference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8222" display="02:17:02" %}} - for this too Universe was made through Jesus Christ right um yeah it doesn't work unless he's God uh but yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8234" display="02:17:14" %}} - yeah yes there really isn't much to say about all of all of this I agree I mean I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8241" display="02:17:21" %}} - don't it is not a waste of time for us to go through the passages though it's why we're doing also note also note  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8248" display="02:17:28" %}} - we've talked about this before uh compared to some of the other parts of this study in uh Bible basics theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8255" display="02:17:35" %}} - is kind of short and if you look it's not like I just skipped paragraphs I like I didn't copy into the slides for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8262" display="02:17:42" %}} - the points that we're doing here these are the points this is all that the study says um it just is literally a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8268" display="02:17:48" %}} - list of Bible references right because we have talked through some of this we're trying to explain to fill in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8275" display="02:17:55" %}} - little bit maybe get a little bit more picture of what these passages are saying but it's right there in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8283" display="02:18:03" %}} - passages right we we aren't we aren't going through a complicated set of steps to no you know find evidence for that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8290" display="02:18:10" %}} - which we are discussing um yeah all right well yeah uh I think that's where we will wrap this one um this has been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8299" display="02:18:19" %}} - establishing that the sun is divine the sun is god um so we started talking about how the father is God now we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8306" display="02:18:26" %}} - talked about how the son is God next thing we'll talk about is how the spirit is God as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8314" display="02:18:34" %}} - well so now we are going to talk about how the holy spirit is God so having talked about how the father is God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8323" display="02:18:43" %}} - the son is God we've gone through many scripture passages to help support these points we've made we are going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8330" display="02:18:50" %}} - doing the same thing for the spirit and in some ways as I know we have noted in our past discussions this is perhaps the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8338" display="02:18:58" %}} - one that trips people up the most that has a tendency to perhaps not seem quite as straightforward as the other two  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8347" display="02:19:07" %}} - members of the Trinity but as we'll see there are a number of passages that make the point clear enough that we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8354" display="02:19:14" %}} - have to guess at this it just like the other two members of the Trinity is something that is right there in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8360" display="02:19:20" %}} - scripture if we just have eyes to see so with that we're just going to go ahead and go through the passages just how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8366" display="02:19:26" %}} - we've done for the last couple starting with uh the actually the second verse of the Bible here in Genesis chapter 1 um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8375" display="02:19:35" %}} - now for those of us who follow ikus uh this is a familiar verse because this is the primary verse uh when you interpret  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8384" display="02:19:44" %}} - the Hebrew here for uh kind of translating formless and void uh also you know shows up in the book of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8391" display="02:19:51" %}} - Jeremiah uh the Hebrew here toou Vu can translate as ruined and despoiled and we have the the was here uh the Earth was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8402" display="02:20:02" %}} - um if you translate it a certain way based on the disjunctive Clause that comes after you can also translate it as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8409" display="02:20:09" %}} - became and so if you translate this as the Earth became ruined and despoiled suddenly that's a lot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8415" display="02:20:15" %}} - different right um so this is how ikus explains the Genesis Gap that's what this verse comes so not to get too off  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8423" display="02:20:23" %}} - on a tangent there but the operative Point here is that the spirit of God shows up in the creation narrative here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8429" display="02:20:29" %}} - in Genesis chapter 1 um and in fact if we go look at the rest of Genesis you know it is very clear that uh God is in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8439" display="02:20:39" %}} - view oops Genesis one uh God is in view during the creation narrative um so in the beginning God created the heavens  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8446" display="02:20:46" %}} - and the Earth and then in the very same breath as that statement then we have the spirit of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8453" display="02:20:53" %}} - coming in the next verse and then in verse three we have just God again and so it would be kind of strange here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8461" display="02:21:01" %}} - within the narrative for us to go from God to spirit of God who would somehow not be God and then God again uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8469" display="02:21:09" %}} - know in terms of what we would call narrative structure even if you have like a narrator or characters in a book  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8477" display="02:21:17" %}} - not that the Bible is a novel per se but you you just don't switch subjects like that uh especially going from one to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8485" display="02:21:25" %}} - other and then back to the the initial one in just a sentence later uh so this is what I would call strong inferential  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8492" display="02:21:32" %}} - evidence that the spirit of God is God that they are one and the same um now of course we know from the Gospel of John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8501" display="02:21:41" %}} - in John chapter 1 that the agent in creation was the son um there are other passages in the Bible that talk about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8508" display="02:21:48" %}} - how through him all things were made um or maybe that's in John too at any rate um the son is the agent of creation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8517" display="02:21:57" %}} - within the context of recreation at least that's what we would say Genesis chapter 1 is if you believe in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8525" display="02:22:05" %}} - Genesis Gap or the idea that we have the world has been restored after the Judgment that God rendered upon the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8532" display="02:22:12" %}} - universe for the rebellion of Satan and the angels um that the spirit of God is involved here in this chapter within the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8542" display="02:22:22" %}} - same breath within the same breath as God you know in verse one and verse three immediately preceding and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8549" display="02:22:29" %}} - immediately following um so AI do you have thoughts on this verse as it supports the point of the spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8559" display="02:22:39" %}} - god um uh not not really I think it's a pretty straightforward thing there is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8568" display="02:22:48" %}} - an agent so to speak someone who is actually doing something and then um we see someone else in view which seems to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8578" display="02:22:58" %}} - suggest that just like you said uh it certainly has to be well if we don't say the same person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8587" display="02:23:07" %}} - well they they are of a class they're of the same class um some God is doing the creating something happened to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8596" display="02:23:16" %}} - creation and God is still featuring we don't see any other person here so if the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8603" display="02:23:23" %}} - of God is here then um it's a pretty strong uh uh correlation being made here that's that's it's pretty much what you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8613" display="02:23:33" %}} - said so I don't really have anything for to add and I think maybe just to riff I know we've talked about this before I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8618" display="02:23:38" %}} - don't remember in exactly which segment but how God is not some sort of husk that is inhabited by a spirit right we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8625" display="02:23:45" %}} - talked about the differences between our makeup as humans where we have flesh and spirit combined we are dichotomous  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8633" display="02:23:53" %}} - beings uh spirit is what gives us life the word for Spirit in both Greek and Hebrew actually means breath uh we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8641" display="02:24:01" %}} - talked about all of this for the makeup of humans and then we said God is Not B uh God does not have this second part  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8648" display="02:24:08" %}} - like how we do as humans God is Spirit but when we talk of the spirit of God it's not as if the father is somehow the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8656" display="02:24:16" %}} - shell that Spirit resides in or or any sort of wrong-headed idea like that so uh you know just reiterating that point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8665" display="02:24:25" %}} - that we've made before when we talk of the spirit of God it is not as if we say the spirit of God is to the human spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8673" display="02:24:33" %}} - in a onetoone sort of correlation um it's not the same thing and of course Angels Are Spiritual but they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8681" display="02:24:41" %}} - different from both us as humans and from God so um I think we talked Over All that in the past but just making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8688" display="02:24:48" %}} - that point again so in my opinion actually there were there's obviously quite a few passages here this was one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8694" display="02:24:54" %}} - of the ones that I don't think it's maybe quite as clear it's inferential is what I would say um if you say somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8700" display="02:25:00" %}} - that the Spirit In this passage is not God then you have some explaining to do um I don't think it's as logically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8705" display="02:25:05" %}} - airtight as some of the other passages which we'll go through in a moment here so next one we're going to look at Psalm  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8713" display="02:25:13" %}} - 139:7 um we have established previous L that one of the characteristics of God is omnipresence we talked about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8722" display="02:25:22" %}} - running away from God is futile just like Jonah because no matter where you go God is there um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8729" display="02:25:29" %}} - omnipresence is this idea that within material creation God is everywhere um and here in Psalm 139 we see that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8740" display="02:25:40" %}} - spirit here of God has this quality which as we have argued in the other section is what we would call an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8749" display="02:25:49" %}} - essential characteristic of God um at least in applied with respect to Creation you know the essential  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8755" display="02:25:55" %}} - characteristic I suppose we would say is immeasurability but within creation that manifests as omnipresence and so if that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8762" display="02:26:02" %}} - is something that characterizes God and the spirit has that then the spirit is God QED sort of how this verse supports  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8770" display="02:26:10" %}} - the idea um anything more you want to you want to add um not really I think that's exactly the argument um we cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8781" display="02:26:21" %}} - escape from the spirit of God wherever we go his presence is there so that that is essentially saying that the spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8792" display="02:26:32" %}} - God I mean it's not saying it explicitly but it's right there you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8800" display="02:26:40" %}} - y all right good deal um this one somewhat clear right I mean that's still a couple hops in logic to get there but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8808" display="02:26:48" %}} - once you understand that immeasurability and omnipresence are unique characteristics of God as in God is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8814" display="02:26:54" %}} - only being to possess those then that's how you get there um so that's these two now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8822" display="02:27:02" %}} - get to one of the ones that I think is dead clear um you really really have to do explaining away if you try to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8829" display="02:27:09" %}} - the spirit not God In this passage and this is in Acts chapter 5 uh with ananas and saf withholding some of the sale of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8837" display="02:27:17" %}} - their land now this passage uh I won't get on a super big side tangent here but uh people sometimes interpret this one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8845" display="02:27:25" %}} - wrong so this idea that um basically if we don't give all our money to the church then God's going to strike us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8852" display="02:27:32" %}} - down dead is not quite the point of the passage um the point is lying to God uh deception uh basically and specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8862" display="02:27:42" %}} - to cement the apostles Authority and this is one of the things that makes this passage kind of tricky to interpret  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8868" display="02:27:48" %}} - uh from what we might call a hermeneutic point of view is like what are we to get out of this how are we supposed to apply  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8874" display="02:27:54" %}} - to our own lives that sort of thing is that the apostles were given a good deal more Authority even than Pastor teachers  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8880" display="02:28:00" %}} - today and they did signs and uh God empowered them to cast out spirits and things like this um and here in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8889" display="02:28:09" %}} - context this is tied up in that to a degree so we see a little bit further on in the passage that the people are given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8896" display="02:28:16" %}} - to fear on account of this um so ananas and his wife struck down on account of deceiving um or attempting to deceive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8906" display="02:28:26" %}} - rather the apostles and as we see here um because fundamentally it is an affront to God himself um but doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8915" display="02:28:35" %}} - quite apply in the same way today so we're going to kind of leave all that aside of just a little bit of background  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8919" display="02:28:39" %}} - on this passage right so I'm going to go ahead and read this this is Acts 5: 3 to 4 says uh but Peter said in IAS why has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8927" display="02:28:47" %}} - Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land while it remained  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8933" display="02:28:53" %}} - unsold did it not remain your own and after it was sold was it not under your control why is it that you have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8941" display="02:29:01" %}} - conceived this deed in your heart you have not lied to men but to God so in verse three we have lying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8950" display="02:29:10" %}} - the Holy Spirit and then in verse four Peter said that you lied to God slam dunk right there is very little way that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8959" display="02:29:19" %}} - you can interpret this without going to Great contortions to somehow say that you know that Peter is saying that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8966" display="02:29:26" %}} - Anan Li to two separate people here um the by far the clearest way to interpret this text is that Anan eyes lying to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8974" display="02:29:34" %}} - Holy Spirit dwelling within him and that the subject or sorry the person being lied to in verse three and verse four is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8981" display="02:29:41" %}} - the same and that the holy spirit is god um questions on how that fits fits together or aie do you have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8988" display="02:29:48" %}} - more to say for this one no not nothing to say on this one right like I said in my opinion this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8996" display="02:29:56" %}} - one of those ones that is this is one of the slam dunk ones this is the one where even if people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9003" display="02:30:03" %}} - don't buy the other ones maybe you can't get out of this um this is very very clear yeah all right Acts chapter 5  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9013" display="02:30:13" %}} - verses three to four um this one is a little bit a little bit less clear in my opinion this is another one where we we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9019" display="02:30:19" %}} - have some work to do here um so this is 1 Corinthians chapter 12 um now well it opens up in not a very pretty view here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9029" display="02:30:29" %}} - let me this is logos um Bible study software um so uh picking up at verse 11 we are talking about the distribution of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9038" display="02:30:38" %}} - spiritual gifts within the body so 1 Corinthians 12 uh one of the primary passages in the Bible talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9047" display="02:30:47" %}} - analogy of the church as one body and uh you know Ephesians 4 mentions gifts distributed to different people in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9055" display="02:30:55" %}} - church but Ephesians 12 also heavily hits that uh Verses 4 through six actually hit all three members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9063" display="02:31:03" %}} - Trinity I'm not sure if we actually went over this bit but it's another one of those places where all three show up and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9069" display="02:31:09" %}} - Audi and I previously made the argument that once you start seeing the threes all over the New Testament the the only  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9077" display="02:31:17" %}} - good way to explain it is that the three members are God that they are the Trinity you know this is why we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9084" display="02:31:24" %}} - continue to argue all all during our discussion here that the Trinity is is in the Bible we don't have to rely on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9091" display="02:31:31" %}} - church councils or later people to uh somehow say that we didn't understand intell then or whatever because uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9098" display="02:31:38" %}} - scripture itself obviously speaks of this Doctrine um so Verses 4 through six talk about how there's a variety gifts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9106" display="02:31:46" %}} - but the Same Spirit variety of Ministries and the same Lord and a variety of effects but the same God who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9111" display="02:31:51" %}} - works all things and all persons so we take God there to be the father um so once we hop down you know in the context  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9118" display="02:31:58" %}} - of this passage um you know I'll just read actually picking up at verse 7 just so we get the context right before verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9125" display="02:32:05" %}} - 11 so it says but to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good so we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9131" display="02:32:11" %}} - spiritual gifts here for to one is given the word of wisdom through the spirit and two another the word of knowledge  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9137" display="02:32:17" %}} - according to the same spirit and to another Faith by The Same Spirit and to another Gifts of healing by the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9142" display="02:32:22" %}} - spirit and to another the effecting of Miracles into another prophecy and to another the distinguishing of spirits to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9149" display="02:32:29" %}} - another various kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues now some of these spiritual gifts that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9155" display="02:32:35" %}} - we just went through those verses 7 through 10 uh were what we would call the transitional gifts During the period  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9163" display="02:32:43" %}} - of Acts uh this is what ichus teaches that during that time before the close of the Canon and before widespread  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9170" display="02:32:50" %}} - copies of scripture were available uh certain gifts prophecy tongues and the interpretation of tongues were used sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9178" display="02:32:58" %}} - of in an overtly Supernatural way to communicate God's truth in the absence of the closed Cannon or the availability  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9184" display="02:33:04" %}} - of the closed Cannon um okay so leaving that aside that's when we get to our verse here that Dr  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9191" display="02:33:11" %}} - lugan Bill's reference verse 11 which says but one in the same Spirit works all these things Distributing to each  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9198" display="02:33:18" %}} - one individually just as he Wills um so I am not exactly in Dr lug Bill's head um you know it took me a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9207" display="02:33:27" %}} - to try to figure out why is he using this verse to support uh you know the spirit's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9212" display="02:33:32" %}} - Divinity here um I think one of the clearer things is that um the spirit has agency here um and I know we've talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9222" display="02:33:42" %}} - about uh the spirit sort of being the impersonal member of of the Trinity the one who is in the background empowering  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9230" display="02:33:50" %}} - things but he's the direct subject in the sentence as in um he has a verb coming I'm trying to think about the way  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9240" display="02:34:00" %}} - that doesn't sound super grammatical here um like like he's the agent you know he's doing something here actively  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9246" display="02:34:06" %}} - um and uh a do you do you have thoughts um you know I I don't want to sound unconvincing but this was one of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9252" display="02:34:12" %}} - verses where I mean I think the entire passage in context supports the Trinity but on this one supporting the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9260" display="02:34:20" %}} - being God directly I was kind of curious why Dr luganville pick first 11 um oh okay um I think you just if if you take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9270" display="02:34:30" %}} - the whole thing together you know it makes sense that um 11 would be would stand out the way that it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9278" display="02:34:38" %}} - does the we have we have um where does it talk about the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9287" display="02:34:47" %}} - Yes varieties of effects the same God varieties of Ministries same Lord Rises of gifts Same Spirit this is this is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9300" display="02:35:00" %}} - it's like a how do how do we express it it's more like these three are are of a Kind they're of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9308" display="02:35:08" %}} - class if if there are no varieties of gifts there will be no Ministries and there will be no effects so the this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9316" display="02:35:16" %}} - a connection of equals and then in verse 11 one and the Same Spirit works all these things Distributing to each one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9324" display="02:35:24" %}} - individually just as he himself Wills that's the sort of language that you would actually apply to God you know so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9331" display="02:35:31" %}} - I think I would actually look at it a bit more obliquely instead of um thinking in terms of these passages  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9338" display="02:35:38" %}} - support the the Trinity it would be more like this pass these passages essentially you know they they they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9346" display="02:35:46" %}} - assume the Trinity that's essentially the point but because um is is the spirit you know Distributing to each one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9356" display="02:35:56" %}} - individually as God Wills as the father Wills as you know as basically he is not doing so on his own authority as God but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9367" display="02:36:07" %}} - he does it on his authority as God he distributes to each one exactly as he pleases it's it's not as if he needs to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9374" display="02:36:14" %}} - be told who to give what so he distributes the gifts according to his own will that's a very significant  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9382" display="02:36:22" %}} - statement to make about the spirit of God you know so for those who struggle with um I I don't think it needs to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9390" display="02:36:30" %}} - exactly clinical you know to speak to what we're saying the Bible just assumes it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9398" display="02:36:38" %}} - does not actually you know profer um what would I call it it doesn't profer an explicit teaching of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9406" display="02:36:46" %}} - the Trinity just as it does a lot of things it's more like well here it is it's it's just it's just something it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9413" display="02:36:53" %}} - assumes and and presents in so many different ways that it essentially says don't you see it I mean it's kind of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9420" display="02:37:00" %}} - point I mean don't you see it it's it frames the entire thing it's trying to say or it is saying it's it doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9429" display="02:37:09" %}} - focus on it as a thing so um yeah that's what I would say about this verse 11 I think it's actually a pretty it's a it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9439" display="02:37:19" %}} - a it's each one that that we mention is even even when it seems to be a bit uh obscure is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9449" display="02:37:29" %}} - actually by itself so enough because how would you say that the one and the Same Spirit works all these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9458" display="02:37:38" %}} - things and it distributes to each one individually as he Wills I mean we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9466" display="02:37:46" %}} - um what God is looking to accomplish in the church and the spirit is acting on his own will you know that's a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9472" display="02:37:52" %}} - significant thing to say so you know I guess you know how we had one of the other ones basically obliquely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9479" display="02:37:59" %}} - referencing omnipresence right yeah you remember I I made the argument when we were talking about omniscience uh when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9487" display="02:38:07" %}} - it comes to molinism and this idea of how does God know best before things have happened that requires for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9493" display="02:38:13" %}} - knowledge and omniscience I I suppose you could you could say that this verse is very much getting at omniscience  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9500" display="02:38:20" %}} - right how could the spirit possibly know what gifts to distribute perfectly according to God's plan if he was not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9507" display="02:38:27" %}} - God um I I don't know necessarily if that's exactly what Dr lug and kind but you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9515" display="02:38:35" %}} - know you can get there you know as you say um it if the spirit is not God what does this verse mean that is a fair  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9524" display="02:38:44" %}} - question yeah you know I mean I I I really and you know that's one of the things where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9530" display="02:38:50" %}} - um we are not necessarily teaching this Doctrine from the perspective of what I might call an apologetic fashion um as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9538" display="02:38:58" %}} - in if I were talking to a skeptical crowd and I was like and they want me to show a verse where like it's logically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9546" display="02:39:06" %}} - inescapable that the spirit is God I would lead with Acts chapter 5 that passage because in that particular one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9552" display="02:39:12" %}} - it's like I said it's more of a slam dunk Passage in this particular one it's it's more evidence right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9559" display="02:39:19" %}} - because the most clear straightforward way to interpret this is that the spirit is God because he's taking this action  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9566" display="02:39:26" %}} - in this way which would have to perfectly align with the plan of the other members of the Trinity for it to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9571" display="02:39:31" %}} - make any sense and that just if he's not God why does it happen like this right suppose you could make an argument that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9579" display="02:39:39" %}} - he was just doing as he commanded but then why does it say as he Wills rather than as the father Wills for example you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9585" display="02:39:45" %}} - know I mean you can get there it's just you know yeah I I get it I get it I suppose  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9592" display="02:39:52" %}} - I just um I I don't particularly uh uh you know frame it with respect  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9600" display="02:40:00" %}} - to um people who want to see it literally stated it's it's more like we much as we are looking at each passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9609" display="02:40:09" %}} - in isolation in the end we're really looking at the Bible as a whole so each passage is part of you know the context  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9616" display="02:40:16" %}} - it's part of the um whole thing so it's essentially saying look here it's mentioned again here is it's imp passing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9623" display="02:40:23" %}} - you know it may not be in your face or or explicit as you might expect but all of these passages only make sense when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9632" display="02:40:32" %}} - you assume the Trinity once you don't assume the Trinity meaning is lost the thing does not make sense anymore so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9642" display="02:40:42" %}} - what would it mean if you say that the spirit one one and and the same spirit is is is giving these gifts and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9651" display="02:40:51" %}} - distributing them entirely as he pleases as he himself Wills what does that mean for those who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9660" display="02:41:00" %}} - say oh to make sense of the spirit of God you have to think of him as a force well what force is willing anything what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9667" display="02:41:07" %}} - force is having a pleasing a a sense of this pleases me this is what I would like to do that an impersonal Force have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9675" display="02:41:15" %}} - that sort of thing okay so let's not talk about an impersonal Force this is the spirit of the father well you still  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9682" display="02:41:22" %}} - have have to deal with the context of this particular statement one and the Same Spirit Works in all of these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9687" display="02:41:27" %}} - well yeah that's like saying um uh Aima um there are there are varieties of gifts but the same Aima and there are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9700" display="02:41:40" %}} - varieties of Ministries but the same here noi basically it's the same person is referencing just using different  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9707" display="02:41:47" %}} - words for emphasis okay great let's work with that then when when you make these arguments and you put in the rest of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9716" display="02:41:56" %}} - of of of the statements from the scriptures does it make sense no you find yourself still having to deal with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9724" display="02:42:04" %}} - things that don't fit together but once you just when you've taken all of these things together you you you come down to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9733" display="02:42:13" %}} - there are three persons here and one of them is the spirit you it's just a natural Fallout of the reading y I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9742" display="02:42:22" %}} - specifically this passage uh you know we'll get to the other thing uh soon enough talking about how there are three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9748" display="02:42:28" %}} - distinct persons in the Trinity right we are not Mists as Christians we don't believe there's one God with three modes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9754" display="02:42:34" %}} - or aspects this is a good passage for that actually because the passage makes no sense interpretation wise if you say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9761" display="02:42:41" %}} - it's all just the same being right um yeah well you know sufficient there too is our discussion I think um one more of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9771" display="02:42:51" %}} - what I would call the slam dunk references that we're going to go through here um this involves a passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9776" display="02:42:56" %}} - from the Old Testament being quoted in the New Testament and you'll see why this is important in its reference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9785" display="02:43:05" %}} - so this is Hebrews chapter 3 so the writer of Hebrews says therefore just as the holy spirit says today if you hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9793" display="02:43:13" %}} - his voice do not Harden your hearts as when they provoked me in the day of trial in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9797" display="02:43:17" %}} - wilderness uh and then so on talking about the hardness of Hearts of the generation that wandered in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9804" display="02:43:24" %}} - wilderness for 40 years so this is Hebrews chapter 3: 7 through 11 says therefore just as the holy spirit says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9810" display="02:43:30" %}} - and then this is quoting Psalm chapter 95 and uh you know verse seven in Psalm  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9818" display="02:43:38" %}} - chapter 95 says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you would  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9824" display="02:43:44" %}} - hear his voice his being uh definite having the antecedent of God here um do not Harden your hearts as in marah as in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9833" display="02:43:53" %}} - the day of mass in the wilderness so here his voice is said to be God and then when Paul quotes it or the writer  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9840" display="02:44:00" %}} - of Hebrews if you don't take HEB to be Paul um says that the holy spirit says this the holy spirit is directly equated  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9848" display="02:44:08" %}} - with god um because it's directly quoting uh this Psalm here like the wording that you see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9855" display="02:44:15" %}} - here is like it it is I mean so Hebrews the book of Hebrews is written in Greek um Psalm 95 would have been written in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9863" display="02:44:23" %}} - Hebrew whether it's a direct quote from the seant or whether the writer of Hebrews paraphrased from the Hebrew  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9869" display="02:44:29" %}} - directly um either way I actually don't know off the top of my head for this one which one it is um but either way this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9876" display="02:44:36" %}} - is a very clear quotation of Psalm 95 and so that's where we get the direct equivalence made between uh God's voice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9884" display="02:44:44" %}} - here uh in verse 7 of Psalm 95 and the Holy Spirit being the one speaking in verse chapter 7 of Hebrews chapter 3 or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9894" display="02:44:54" %}} - sorry verse seven of Hebrews chapter 3 so uh this is actually one of my favorite passages for defending the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9903" display="02:45:03" %}} - Trinity whenever I've had to engage with uh atheists and others about the Trinity I would always say especially those who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9912" display="02:45:12" %}} - insist that the holy spirit is not a person and like well makesense you know right Mak sense of this and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9921" display="02:45:21" %}} - again we we are not even close to exhausting all the references and scriptures to the persons of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9929" display="02:45:29" %}} - and you know all the all basically all the references that have anything to do with with the Trinity these are just a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9937" display="02:45:37" %}} - sampling and some of them are really a very strong obvious sampling we if we correlate um Hebrews 3 with Psalm 95 we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9947" display="02:45:47" %}} - can I think Psalm 97 sorry which one is it it's Psalm 95 here yeah that's Psalm 95 yeah so um if we if we were to put  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9959" display="02:45:59" %}} - them side by side we can see oh at least Paul takes uh the the the psalm to be referring to the Holy Spirit but you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9970" display="02:46:10" %}} - know then you have people who have absolutely no respect for the Bible saying well Paul might have been wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9977" display="02:46:17" %}} - there or we know that Hebrews has this problem or that problem so we can't admit it as evidence or you know they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9984" display="02:46:24" %}} - come up with all sorts of excuses for rejecting that um bottom line is in so far as you accept Hebrews as part of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9992" display="02:46:32" %}} - Bible you have to accept that the holy spirit is speaking with the authority of God and he's speaking as a person there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10001" display="02:46:41" %}} - so but then I what I found um really first of all I don't like making I'm not interested really in persuading people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10010" display="02:46:50" %}} - about what the scriptures teach and what they don't teach I want to lay out exactly what I've seen in the Bible and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10016" display="02:46:56" %}} - each person can make their decisions as say please but I've seen that when when I had to deal with arguments that were  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10026" display="02:47:06" %}} - about for example the um personality that that is that that the holy spirit is a person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10035" display="02:47:15" %}} - when I've had to deal with that okay no when I've had to deal with the argument that the Holy Spirit and Jesus are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10042" display="02:47:22" %}} - separate persons from the father it has been very very tough because if you were to present this passage to such a person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10049" display="02:47:29" %}} - they would be like sure it's still the father speaking we're not saying that the spirit does not speak we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10054" display="02:47:34" %}} - that the father and the spirit are the same so of course the spirit can't speak well that that makes no difference you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10059" display="02:47:39" %}} - know so those who are models so to speak wouldn't have any problems dealing with these passages the spirit is speaking oh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10068" display="02:47:48" %}} - sure the spirit speaks so what we're not saying he doesn't speak we're just saying that he's the father was saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10074" display="02:47:54" %}} - he's the same as as the son and I've actually argued with someone I've debated someone who actually said look  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10082" display="02:48:02" %}} - that when Jesus went into the water and Rose up out of the water it was himself speaking from Heaven to himself and also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10093" display="02:48:13" %}} - a lighting from heaven upon himself it was like how can you make this how does it work in your head all of this stuff  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10103" display="02:48:23" %}} - you can put it together in one mind and it works for you but that's exactly how people can get when it comes to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10111" display="02:48:31" %}} - truth we have we can't we can't underestimate people's um capacity to reject the truth and to make up their  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10119" display="02:48:39" %}} - own excuse their own um uh contortions and and Replacements and substitutions for the truth so what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10129" display="02:48:49" %}} - can say definitively without any doubt is that the Bible presents the Holy Spirit here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10134" display="02:48:54" %}} - as speaking and as having a will of his own because he is reacting in a way that I mean a lot of people who like to think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10141" display="02:49:01" %}} - of the Holy Spirit as retiring and shy and all of that would be pretty shocked when they actually see that what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10147" display="02:49:07" %}} - being said in Hebrews 3 is that he was angry with his generation and swore that they would never enter his into his rest  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10154" display="02:49:14" %}} - some something that seems to fit more um with the personality of the father than you would expect of the Holy Spirit and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10162" display="02:49:22" %}} - yet this is the holy spirit of whom it is being spoken so um yeah everything we see here speaks to what we have seen in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10173" display="02:49:33" %}} - the Bible that there are three persons and one of them is the holy spirit that's that's it yep well uh sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10182" display="02:49:42" %}} - interesting aside here we know from Hebrews chapter four actually that the rest of God you know the continuous  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10187" display="02:49:47" %}} - Sabbath rest we actually enter that through the indwelling Holy Spirit now that we are all indwelt by the spirit in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10193" display="02:49:53" %}} - the New Testament I'm not so far I'm not so sure I would go so far as to say that that is explicitly in view but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10200" display="02:50:00" %}} - it does come right after Hebrews chapter 3 so interesting side note there um when he talks about my rest holy spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10208" display="02:50:08" %}} - the gatekeeper of that because it is through the spirit that we in the modern day um indwelt by the spirit re go into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10217" display="02:50:17" %}} - that continual Sabbath rest of God that Hebrews chapter 4 talks about um so fun fact um so I'll leave these verses up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10225" display="02:50:25" %}} - we'll come back to them um as we go through uh the next uh the next study which will be that there are three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10234" display="02:50:34" %}} - persons in the Trinity but this was the last passage that we had here for um supporting that the idea that the holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10243" display="02:50:43" %}} - spirit is God I'm actually we have a verse from 2 Corinthians up on the slide as well 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10250" display="02:50:50" %}} - Lord is the spirit and where the Lord's spirit is there is freedom um uh interesting that the Lord is the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10257" display="02:50:57" %}} - so modus would be cool with that but then the way it's worded is that we have you know uh the Lord being possessive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10265" display="02:51:05" %}} - here um so be probably genitive in Greek um before spirit so the Lord is the spirit and where the Lord's spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10273" display="02:51:13" %}} - is makes no sense unless they're both God right um so all these verses as we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10281" display="02:51:21" %}} - saying is not completely representative of literally all the references to the trinity in the Bible you know we've gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10287" display="02:51:27" %}} - across quite a few here with respect to the father and the son and the spirit um but the point is the Bible all over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10295" display="02:51:35" %}} - place supports this notion that the members of the Trinity are God um so uh a you have anything else else to say on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10305" display="02:51:45" %}} - the spirit specifically uh before we close out this lesson uh no I think I think it's it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10312" display="02:51:52" %}} - it's quite enough so far yeah okay good deal so now that we have finished discussing the spirit we have gone
