### Summary {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be kicking off our new study of BB1: Theology on Ichthys by starting to discuss the Essence of God. We'll talk about how God is being (Exodus 3:14-15), as well as exactly what essence means as a concept.

#### The essence of God is being. He is the Great I AM {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-essence-of-god-is-being-he-is-the-great-i-am}

The essence of something is what it really is. "Essence" and "being" are precise synonyms.

God tells us who He is in Exodus 3:14-15.

If you've ever thought about the question "Well, if the universe exists because God made it, then why does God exist? Did something or someone likewise make God?" then the answer is no---God exists simply because God *is* being.

Unbelievers scoff at that logic, but it is what the Bible says.

#### The resplendence of God: light and glory {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-resplendence-of-god-light-and-glory}

<a href="/subject-index/#god-resplendence-glory">God > Resplendence > Glory</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Loosely speaking, light captures the sense that God is sublime and unapproachable (compare squinting at the sun, being blinded by it), while glory represents the side that shines forth visibly to mankind.

God's glory is most directly revealed to mankind through His Son, Jesus Christ. As Hebrews 1:1-3 makes clear.

##### Q: 1 Timothy 6:16 talks about God's unapproachable light. It also says God alone possess immortality. What does that latter statement mean? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-1-timothy-6-16-talks-about-god-s-unapproachable-light-it-also-says-god-alone-possess-immortality-what-does-that-latter-statement-mean}

When 1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God possess immortality, what about the fact that both humans and angels have eternal existence?

Is it that God *owns* immortality, but that he gives it to us creatures such that we too now possess it (some to eternal life, and some to eternal death, based upon that which we choose)? Is this another aspect of God's Uniqueness?


##### Q: We say God dwells in this unapproachable light that no one has seen nor ever can see. What then of cases in scripture where people seem to have "seen God?" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-we-say-god-dwells-in-this-unapproachable-light-that-no-one-has-seen-nor-ever-can-see-what-then-of-cases-in-scripture-where-people-seem-to-have-seen-god}

Did Moses not see this light upon Mount Sinai? What about the Apostles present on the mount of transfiguration? What about Paul on the road to Damascus? What about John in His visions of God, recorded in Revelation?


##### Comment: God's glory as it relates to "every knee will bow, and every tongue confess" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-comment-god-s-glory-as-it-relates-to-every-knee-will-bow-and-every-tongue-confess}

The visible form of this glory was veiled in Christ's first advent to make the choice for Him genuine. The glory was, however, revealed in His words and works.

Compare: "Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess." That is not now, but eventually.

#### Essence, nature, character... ??? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-essence-nature-character}

If you've ever been confused about what the difference between nature and essence is (and we may as well throw form and substance in the mix as well), you are in good company. Philosophers have been arguing about these things for a very long time (compare Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and others).

Arguments usually seem to hinge on how "inherent" something is to an object. For example, a triangle must have three sides, otherwise it is no longer a triangle. Things that are "essential" (compare the word essence!) are things without which the object is not whatever we are saying it is.

Compare this link: https://chrismlegg.com/2018/06/19/what-do-essence-and-nature-mean-a-simple-explanation/

<!-- --- -->

So, on our topic, must God be infinite and perfect in character to be God? Are these essential characteristics of God?

It is my opinion that wandering too far in this direction rapidly leads one to theosophy (in the negative sense). God *is* infinite and perfect in character. So what were we arguing about again?

If someone were to whine that I am question-dodging and not defining terms, I would say that God's nature deals with His infinite abilities, God's character deals with His moral perfection, and both are fundamental parts of who He is as God.

### Video/audio transcript {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-video-audio-transcript}

{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right guys so we are picking up here today in early July 2023 and we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="5" display="0:05" %}} - kicking off a new study here in the Bible basic series on ichus and so we had previously gone through part 6A  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="13" display="0:13" %}} - talking about the study of the Christian walk and we are now here picking up at the very beginning of the Bible basic  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="19" display="0:19" %}} - Series going over theology so the study of God and in our first lesson here  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="25" display="0:25" %}} - today we're going to be picking up uh introducing the the concept of the essence of God and so here's the things  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="31" display="0:31" %}} - that we are going to be talking about here uh in this first one we're going to be talking about how God is being he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="38" display="0:38" %}} - The Great I Am we have this verse in Exodus chapter 3 where he tells Moses  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="43" display="0:43" %}} - who he is his identity his Essence we're going to be talking about the resplendence of God and what that means  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="50" display="0:50" %}} - in terms of light and glory and then we're also going to talk a little bit about the difference between Essence and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="56" display="0:56" %}} - nature you may have also heard the words form and substance character what are these things you know these  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="62" display="1:02" %}} - Concepts that philosophers talk about so we'll spend a little bit of time there as  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="68" display="1:08" %}} - well all right so the first thing that we are going to be talking about is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="74" display="1:14" %}} - essence of God specifically how God is being he is The Great I Am and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - essence of something is what it really is Essence and being are precise synonyms they come from this Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="87" display="1:27" %}} - participle UIA um there's one in Latin is well very similar so Essence and being are essentially precise synonyms  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="94" display="1:34" %}} - now this is the passage here in Exodus chapter 3 where God tells us who he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="100" display="1:40" %}} - um so I'm just going to go ahead and read this uh God said to Moses I am who  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="106" display="1:46" %}} - I am and he said thus you shall say to the sons of Israel I am has sent me to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="111" display="1:51" %}} - you God furthermore said to Moses thus you shall say to the sons of Israel the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="117" display="1:57" %}} - Lord the god of your fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob has sent me to you this is my name  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="124" display="2:04" %}} - forever and this is my Memorial name to all generations and so in the Hebrew this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="130" display="2:10" %}} - word is actually it's got this really jargony technical name called the tetr Graton it means four letters in Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="136" display="2:16" %}} - that's what the Greek word taton means um but it's this unpronouncable name of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="143" display="2:23" %}} - God that's how the Hebrews viewed it the holy name of God's real identity and uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="150" display="2:30" %}} - the the translates sometimes you may see it in English as Yahweh um you know the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="155" display="2:35" %}} - the four letters here um but that gets to the idea of being in Hebrew as well  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="162" display="2:42" %}} - and so that's where this I am comes from and so this is who God says he is this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="167" display="2:47" %}} - is the fundamental essence of God is caught up in this idea of existence and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="174" display="2:54" %}} - so moving on down a bit here in the first thing we're going to talk about if you've ever thought about the question  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="180" display="3:00" %}} - of well if the universe exists because God made it that's what the Bible says  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="185" display="3:05" %}} - well then why does God exist did something or someone likewise make god well the answer to that is no God exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="192" display="3:12" %}} - simply because God is being God is existence so unbelievers kind of scoff  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="197" display="3:17" %}} - at this but it is more or less what the Bible actually says all right aie so you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="203" display="3:23" %}} - had something else you wanted to say about God being The Great I Am okay yeah um I think uh the thing I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="213" display="3:33" %}} - particularly interested in is what unbelievers say about that when you argue you know um that the there the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="221" display="3:41" %}} - question who created God or where did God come from or where was God and all of that is actually nonsense um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="229" display="3:49" %}} - the the reason that that question is nonsense is just like you said that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="235" display="3:55" %}} - is being right he is the is that which just is the I am what I am I am what I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="245" display="4:05" %}} - will be or I will be what I am however you you you you skew it the idea is this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="251" display="4:11" %}} - that I I am that which just is so the main thing I want to raise about that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="257" display="4:17" %}} - because of my um apologetic bent whenever I engage in these matters is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="263" display="4:23" %}} - this that there is there is in the very existence of anything the demand for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="269" display="4:29" %}} - something that has always existed and never had a beginning or an end that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="275" display="4:35" %}} - a fundamental requirement for anything to exist if something has not always  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="281" display="4:41" %}} - existed then nothing should exist this is exactly why currently in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="288" display="4:48" %}} - physics um those who have been who who are still holding on to the theory of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="293" display="4:53" %}} - the Big Bang are are trying to make the word nothing mean something other than  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="300" display="5:00" %}} - nothing they're insisting that nothing is not nothing that nothing is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="305" display="5:05" %}} - compressed very weird they they get very esoteric with the definition of nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="311" display="5:11" %}} - and they they've been banding it around in in the halls of physics for a few years now at least that I know of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="319" display="5:19" %}} - everybody knows that in order to have everything that is you have to begin with something you have to so this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="328" display="5:28" %}} - another reason why for us Christians the burden of proof that God exists is never on us because everything demands that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="335" display="5:35" %}} - should exist it is either you have God or you have the universe and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="341" display="5:41" %}} - universe is manifestly not God because the universe experiences change it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="348" display="5:48" %}} - transforms and that requires that something is acting upon it that is how  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="355" display="5:55" %}} - change happens change is is is things that are are stable in nature do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="361" display="6:01" %}} - change and that is why God is the is the is that's another aspect of God being  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="367" display="6:07" %}} - the is it means he never changes nothing can act on him and transform him in any  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="373" display="6:13" %}} - way and nothing can compromise the quality of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="379" display="6:19" %}} - existence but God can act on everything he can Will things into existence that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="384" display="6:24" %}} - actually how he created you know everything that is and can I for a a um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="391" display="6:31" %}} - the point that we're making here is great um one of the other reasons why it just makes sense for us to speak of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="397" display="6:37" %}} - existence qu existence for us as humans is because we exist only within you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="403" display="6:43" %}} - four dimensions right space and matter and time we are bound by them and our  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="409" display="6:49" %}} - conception of existence is fundamentally linked to these properties which God is not bound by and so this is one reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="417" display="6:57" %}} - why it can be difficult for us to talk with atheists or even agnostic people about this is just we we aren't starting  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="424" display="7:04" %}} - from the same ideas of what existence even is because when they talk about something existing before time what does  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="431" display="7:11" %}} - existing before time even mean like we as humans have a very bad understanding  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="437" display="7:17" %}} - of this because we are limited by SpaceTime um another thing just bouncing off points you brought up um this comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="444" display="7:24" %}} - up in philosophy some of the arguments for God's existence I personally I've always been more like well God exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="450" display="7:30" %}} - because the Bible says he does and we trust the Bible and we take it on faith it's a presupposition but philosophers  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="455" display="7:35" %}} - do argue about this um there's one particular argument that goes something about the need for an uncaused cause  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="462" display="7:42" %}} - right the prime mover believe that's what Aristotle calls it um the uncaused cause it is logically necessary if  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="471" display="7:51" %}} - everything in the universe is this chain of cause and effect something has to set it off to begin with and like Audi said  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="476" display="7:56" %}} - it can't be the big bang because right now I don't want to be mean but my understanding of the physics is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="482" display="8:02" %}} - right now they say that before there was time and space and matter there was like a point charge of energy and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="487" display="8:07" %}} - fundamental problem with this is that the point charge of energy is still not nothing so um that's just me riffing on  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="494" display="8:14" %}} - all the things you brought up um very good points here yeah yeah so I I want to say finally  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="502" display="8:22" %}} - just to wrap up that the reason I've actually gone into this is not because I know that a lot of Christians really  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="508" display="8:28" %}} - generally don't want to deal with philosophy and all of that because they feel like it it goes against faith in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="514" display="8:34" %}} - some way um but that's not the point I'm not even interested in addressing that specifically the reason I'm raising it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="520" display="8:40" %}} - is this to show that there is a reason that the Bible says first the fool says  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="528" display="8:48" %}} - in his heart that there is no God second that everything that exists is Testament  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="534" display="8:54" %}} - it's a testament of God's existence that's Psalm 19: 1-6 and Revelation um sorry Romans  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="541" display="9:01" %}} - 1:20 the Bible States it as an incontrovertible fact that the bare  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="547" display="9:07" %}} - existence of of the universe as we see it is absolute incontrovertible proof of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="555" display="9:15" %}} - God's existence there is in other words you have to deny reality to deny God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="561" display="9:21" %}} - existence because however you skew It Whatever argument you make you either  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="568" display="9:28" %}} - end up with something that always has been and therefore brought everything else that exists about or you end up  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="576" display="9:36" %}} - where you assume that something that obviously cannot always have been is that which has always been so you can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="583" display="9:43" %}} - really get away from the core definition of what God is that which always is yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="590" display="9:50" %}} - you can't get away from it so you either accept that that definition belongs to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="595" display="9:55" %}} - the god that we find in the Bible or you ascribe it to the universe that you exist in or even ascribe it to yourself  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="601" display="10:01" %}} - if you're willing to go so far as to be a solipsist you will always ascribe that quality to something which means you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="608" display="10:08" %}} - cannot get away from deity in any philosophy that any human being has ever come up with so I will say there a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="616" display="10:16" %}} - branch of neoplatonic philosophers I wrote a paper on one of them in college there's this guy named platinus um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="622" display="10:22" %}} - so some of the neoplatonic folks they called for all intents and purposes what they called God we believe as is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="628" display="10:28" %}} - Christian God and they they they had a similar concept again these are pagans not believing in judeo-christian God but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="635" display="10:35" %}} - they had the same problems with existence and the uncaused cause and all of this they conceptualized something  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="642" display="10:42" %}} - and they didn't Define it the same but it's logically necessary is what we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="648" display="10:48" %}} - um and to tie this up perhaps a little bit this is why us grasping that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="655" display="10:55" %}} - existence God is being it is his nature is kind of a core fundamental part of us  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="662" display="11:02" %}} - understanding who God really is um so it's not minor maybe it seems kind of hard to wrap our heads around and it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="667" display="11:07" %}} - will be for us as finite human beings but it's important in Understanding God's kind of separateness from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="674" display="11:14" %}} - universe he transcends it in a way that we can't perfectly understand but it's really important for us to kind of get  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="681" display="11:21" %}} - that sense of how big God is and how separate he is from everything that has been created um he is the Creator and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="689" display="11:29" %}} - how can he possibly be bound by his own creation that's the idea here yeah yeah okay that's so I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="698" display="11:38" %}} - that's where we'll stop this point and we'll about to pick up with the second  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="706" display="11:46" %}} - one okay all right so the next point that we're going to be talking about is we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="712" display="11:52" %}} - are going to be talking about the idea of the resplendence of God and this is a manifestation of his essence of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="719" display="11:59" %}} - nature um and so uh the study on ikus here I know I pulled things out into  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="724" display="12:04" %}} - slides but this is coming directly from the study talks about light and Glory so loosely speaking light captures the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="731" display="12:11" %}} - sense that God is Sublime and unapproachable and so you might compare squinting at the Sun and being blinded  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="737" display="12:17" %}} - by it you can't really see it while Glory represents this the side that shines forth visibly to mankind so we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="744" display="12:24" %}} - see the glory the effects of God's of God's existence and his work working in the world glory is what we can see uh in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="752" display="12:32" %}} - the metaphor here light is sort of what we can't see the unapproachable of God um and so there's this verse here in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="759" display="12:39" %}} - Hebrews chapter 1 um the Bible is very clear that uh the way in which God has  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="765" display="12:45" %}} - manifested his glory most kind of visibly in the world is by speaking through his son so this is picking up  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="771" display="12:51" %}} - right at the beginning of Hebrews chapter 1 it says God after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="777" display="12:57" %}} - in many portions and in many many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son whom he appointed heir of all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="784" display="13:04" %}} - things through whom he also made the world so Jesus Christ is God's primary  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="790" display="13:10" %}} - message to humankind the primary manifestation of his glory um now we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="796" display="13:16" %}} - not going to get into verse three here uh interesting tangent perhaps but the idea is that Jesus Christ represents  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="803" display="13:23" %}} - God's glory most directly revealed to mankind um so before I kick us off and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="808" display="13:28" %}} - we start doing questions here um Lisa had brought up this quote here from 1  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="814" display="13:34" %}} - Timothy 6: 16 um and so I should probably actually go find that I think I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="819" display="13:39" %}} - have it pulled up over here um so 1 Timothy 6:16 and this is a quote from or  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="825" display="13:45" %}} - one of the verses that Dr duil uses in the ikas study um talking about the unapproachable light it says uh God who  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="833" display="13:53" %}} - alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no one has seen or can see to him be honor and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="839" display="13:59" %}} - eternal Dominion amen so the question here was what does it mean for God Alone  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="846" display="14:06" %}} - to have immortality given that both Angel and human will have kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="852" display="14:12" %}} - Eternal existence um so this is one of those places um where this is an English  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="858" display="14:18" %}} - problem it's not a problem in Greek so the Greek word here um you can see the Greek is up here for 1 Timothy  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="865" display="14:25" %}} - 6:16 um is this one right here see the begin with an alpha and then a Theta right so athanasia is the word here and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="873" display="14:33" %}} - it means more literally translated it means like not dying undying and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="881" display="14:41" %}} - way in which God is different from us is human beings experience death God being  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="886" display="14:46" %}} - separate from SpaceTime God does not die God is unchanging as we've just talked about because God is being God is life  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="894" display="14:54" %}} - that's one of the other things we'll get to and so this word isn't immortality in the sense of Eternal existence as it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - lack of dying if that makes sense that's kind of a separate concept so um I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - know if that question and that answer makes sense but that is one place where we could start  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="915" display="15:15" %}} - here okay yeah um I want to see that quote again God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="922" display="15:22" %}} - Alone possesses immortality okay so the first here in uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="927" display="15:27" %}} - 1 Timothy chapter 6 yeah yeah okay okay so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="934" display="15:34" %}} - uh I think I think uh you you you captured it quite well we don't possess  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="942" display="15:42" %}} - immortality we in the sense of owning it God owns it it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="948" display="15:48" %}} - his and he shared it with us um when we read Ecclesiastes he says that he has  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="954" display="15:54" %}} - set eternity in our hearts and then in another place few verses after that he before that it actually said that um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="962" display="16:02" %}} - everything that God does lasts forever which which kind of proves that he owns  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="968" display="16:08" %}} - immortality um there are those who might argue on the basis of this passage uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - First Timothy that this is why they believe that um unless God actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="981" display="16:21" %}} - gives you life you won't live forever so those who will not be with God in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="987" display="16:27" %}} - eternity will die and that's it they'll be gone from existence but that flies in the face of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - what Ecclesiastes says which is that everything that God makes lasts forever and that thing that very statement from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1002" display="16:42" %}} - Ecclesiastes actually explains what we are asking about how is he the only one  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1008" display="16:48" %}} - who possesses immortality it's because it's his he is that which is everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1015" display="16:55" %}} - else derives its aess from him MH so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1020" display="17:00" %}} - when he makes things and imbus them by the quality of just making them that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1026" display="17:06" %}} - just how God is the things he he he builds the things he makes are just like that they exist  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1032" display="17:12" %}} - Forever by D of the fact that he is the one who makes them they are Immortal in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1040" display="17:20" %}} - that sense that's one way to to appreciate the the question of who possesses immortality it's that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1046" display="17:26" %}} - possess it's his and uh he gives it to wh whomever he pleases now um can I cut  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1052" display="17:32" %}} - in with something here as well so I I kind of made the point that this word is getting at lack of death and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - kind of begs the question of well which kind of death if you are familiar with some of ichus teachings you'll know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1066" display="17:46" %}} - ichus generally speaks of three types of death so when the serpent tempts Eve in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1071" display="17:51" %}} - Genesis chapter 3 um the serpent says if you eat of the tree you will surely die  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1076" display="17:56" %}} - and that verse if you don't if you're not careful in your hermeneutics when you interpret it well you know eve took  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1083" display="18:03" %}} - a bite and she didn't immediately get struck by a bolt from heaven for example so that statement was true with regards  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1088" display="18:08" %}} - to physical death so there's kind of physical death and then there's spiritual death which we Define a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1094" display="18:14" %}} - separation from God and then there's what we call the second or Eternal death which is life in the Lake of Fire after  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1101" display="18:21" %}} - we die right and what a he was getting at is well when you die physically that is the destination for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1107" display="18:27" %}} - those who do not believe it is an eternal state of of existence and so you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1112" display="18:32" %}} - might also note that Jesus Christ died physically right but the death in view  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1118" display="18:38" %}} - here is more complicated than just physical death right that's not the only thing in view when we say that God is um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1124" display="18:44" %}} - you know described by this word athanasia right that God does not taste death well  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1130" display="18:50" %}} - God is life right Jesus Christ was never separated from the father in what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1135" display="18:55" %}} - would term a spiritual sense and of course any eternity he's not going to the lake of fire and so it's more than  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1141" display="19:01" %}} - just physical death that is in view here it's the whole shebang the whole Spectrum all three classifications of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1147" display="19:07" %}} - death because God is life fundamentally and he can't like uh what's the right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1153" display="19:13" %}} - word like uh reject himself right how could God die of God his life right it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1158" display="19:18" %}} - just a nonsensical concept yeah now the the reason that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1163" display="19:23" %}} - started from where I started is just to make sure that um we capture the the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1169" display="19:29" %}} - owning of immortality part the other side of things is what you're talking about where the Death part comes in but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1176" display="19:36" %}} - death was actually just like you said I think I want to put a fine point on it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1181" display="19:41" %}} - in this way that death is the it is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1187" display="19:47" %}} - description of our relationship to God in a particular state so physical death  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1194" display="19:54" %}} - was not supposed to be a thing that was not how things were supposed to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1199" display="19:59" %}} - although of course in God's plan he knew what would happen and had written it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1205" display="20:05" %}} - So Physical death the ending of experience in this physical  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1213" display="20:13" %}} - body was the consequence of going contrary to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1219" display="20:19" %}} - which of course is like well if you cease drinking from the Fountain of Life then obviously you start to die so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1229" display="20:29" %}} - when Adam and Eve's relationship with God was cut off the next thing that happened was we're not going to allow  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1235" display="20:35" %}} - them access to the Tree of Life which they if they continue to eat they will exist forever right that was a very um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1245" display="20:45" %}} - uh dramatic or graphic way of demonstrating what had happened spiritually which meant if they were no  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1253" display="20:53" %}} - longer taking their cue from God then they could no longer be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1259" display="20:59" %}} - living so in that sense that that deathlessness comes into play which also  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1267" display="21:07" %}} - derives its meaning from the fact that God owns immortality nothing else  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1272" display="21:12" %}} - possesses it except that he gives it to that thing and that's the point that because God created things they last  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1280" display="21:20" %}} - forever I I'll try to demonstrate first of all we know from the scriptures that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1286" display="21:26" %}} - even if you're an unbeliever you are going to be resurrected your Resurrection is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1292" display="21:32" %}} - going to be the same as the res the resurrection of a Believer but you're going to be resurrected in a body that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1298" display="21:38" %}} - is suited for Eternal condemnation there is no going out of existence forever for anybody because  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1305" display="21:45" %}} - nobody was designed to go out of existence we have also in second Peter  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1311" display="21:51" %}} - chapter 3 that everything we see the entire universe we see is going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1316" display="21:56" %}} - burned up and removed out of the way and yet we have cause to understand that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1324" display="22:04" %}} - that is not necessarily meaning that these things will cease to exist they  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1329" display="22:09" %}} - simply will not exist for the purpose for which they had originally been made  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1335" display="22:15" %}} - this is a a a universe that is Tainted with sin and for that reason it's going to be sort of rolled away removed from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1343" display="22:23" %}} - its place and replaced with something better and that's actually why we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - about the new universe as a resurrection of God's creation rather than rather than like he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1357" display="22:37" %}} - he deleted something entirely and put something else in its place in that sense so the what we're getting at is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1364" display="22:44" %}} - God owns immortality and by by D of the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1370" display="22:50" %}} - he does everything he creates is it it has it built into it in the sense that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1377" display="22:57" %}} - things possess the ability to exist forever not necessarily in the way that they God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - would have wanted them to but in the way that they have come to be used so um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1389" display="23:09" %}} - deathlessness side of things makes absolute sense too when we start to think of the relationship of things to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1395" display="23:15" %}} - God that means he owns immortality if you turn against him then how can you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1402" display="23:22" %}} - actually participate in his immortality in that sense you are cut off from his life in some way it does not mean that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1409" display="23:29" %}} - you will cease to exist forever the unbeliever will still be in the Lake of Fire forever he still exists he has some  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1416" display="23:36" %}} - form of immortality but he is cut off from the life that is God the fullness of life that is God the beauty of life  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1423" display="23:43" %}} - that is God everything because all the there is nothing about goodness or or or  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1429" display="23:49" %}} - life or beauty that is external to God you don't find those things outside of God it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1435" display="23:55" %}} - like uh when people say that um it's something that I believe Proverbs talks about that um stolen stolen bread is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1443" display="24:03" %}} - sweet stolen waters are sweet and the Bible says they end up as gravel in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1448" display="24:08" %}} - mouth that's true some people take pleasure in doing the wrong thing but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1454" display="24:14" %}} - yes that's a warping of our nature but in fact true pleasure is with God that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1462" display="24:22" %}} - where it is so when God removes all that is actually him from a particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1467" display="24:27" %}} - situation you have a husk of an existence there's immortality there but it isely immortality it's like yeah so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1477" display="24:37" %}} - that's where the deathlessness side of things comes from but the reason I started from where I started is to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1482" display="24:42" %}} - sure that we understand that what what Paul is saying to Timothy here is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1488" display="24:48" %}} - because God himself owns this thing that's why we are close to him he owns  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1496" display="24:56" %}} - it none of us can get it from anywhere else immortality is what God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1501" display="25:01" %}} - about that's his is to speak next thing probably I think we have covered this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1508" display="25:08" %}} - one pretty well although of course if anyone wants to ask more questions to clarify things that AI not have said  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1514" display="25:14" %}} - feel free um the next one that we were going to talk about was the idea of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1519" display="25:19" %}} - unapproachable light and so we said light represents the unapproachable sort of in the metaphor here and glory is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1526" display="25:26" %}} - visible form of the presence of God that takes place in the world and so the question is well  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1534" display="25:34" %}} - what about people like Moses on Mount Si the Mount of transfiguration Paul on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1540" display="25:40" %}} - road to Damascus John in his Visions did these people see God right um there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1546" display="25:46" %}} - another verse kind of appropo here um that talks about how no one can see God and live if you guys are recalling I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1554" display="25:54" %}} - don't remember exactly where that verse is I I know it's somewhere in the old test Testament um but well when Moses  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1560" display="26:00" %}} - was receiving the tablets of the law and he came back and his face was shining  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1565" display="26:05" %}} - and I think that comes up in like second Corinthians somewhere Paul talks about us being MIRS reflecting Glory from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1572" display="26:12" %}} - glory to glory uh it's a Greek idiom I don't want to get off topic but this idea of light and did these people  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1580" display="26:20" %}} - actually see God well if no one can see God and live well did they see God and uh if the light is truly unapproachable  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1586" display="26:26" %}} - did they approach the that sort of question um and I'll see what AI thinks but to me I think this comes straight  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1593" display="26:33" %}} - down to the idea of christophanies um so this idea theophany uh you know it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1601" display="26:41" %}} - technical jargon way of saying you know the god coming uh to Earth theophany is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1606" display="26:46" %}} - a seeing of of God and christophany is a seeing of Jesus Christ and so there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1612" display="26:52" %}} - the idea of the like definite article the angel of the Lord in the Old  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1618" display="26:58" %}} - Testament and that is actually a pre-incarnate Jesus Christ that is the second person of the Trinity the son the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1625" display="27:05" %}} - agent the one who created the universe um so if the father's the architect the son's the agent and the spirit is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1632" display="27:12" %}} - empowerer so to speak and we'll get to the Trinity and the roles they adopt a bit later in this study well these  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1638" display="27:18" %}} - instances of people seeing and interacting with God in the Old Testament were interactions with the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1646" display="27:26" %}} - christophanies um and the sort of veil of separation between the third heaven  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1652" display="27:32" %}} - and the universe which is presently tainted by sin uh is to keep the presence of the father distinctly  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1659" display="27:39" %}} - separate and there's some symbolism in The Temple of the holy of holies also separated by a curtain that's kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1665" display="27:45" %}} - the idea of God's holiness cannot be be in the presence of man without destroying the sin um so aie do you want  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1673" display="27:53" %}} - to Riff on anything I've said here about this question of what about these people who saw light or saw God but yet did not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1680" display="28:00" %}} - die you've you've really captured it I'm just going to unravel it a little bit more um so uh like you said it was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1688" display="28:08" %}} - christophany and uh it's important to remember I mean there are people who of course would argue that we we claim that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1694" display="28:14" %}} - Jesus Christ is God so what does that have to do with anything because we're still talking about seeing God and we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1702" display="28:22" %}} - know that where was that it was in John where where John said that they saw the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1709" display="28:29" %}} - god of Israel and ate and drank with him you know so it's like did they see did  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1715" display="28:35" %}} - they not see what which one is it and the Bible is this is where the the question of the Trinity begins to you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1722" display="28:42" %}} - know creep up um exes holds and it is actually something I'm very persuaded is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1729" display="28:49" %}} - actually true true as well that um uh the father presents as the face of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - trinity in other words words he plays the role of the godhead the role of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1742" display="29:02" %}} - in the Trinity so Creation in in in the way they and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1749" display="29:09" %}} - roles of course overlaps overlap with each other the way that the the Trinity self assigned roles to themselves is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1757" display="29:17" %}} - that the father is actually the represent the representation of the deity of the Trinity to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1764" display="29:24" %}} - Creation so the TR the the father stays aloof from sinful creation does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1772" display="29:32" %}} - interact with sinful creation and maintains a barrier of separation from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1778" display="29:38" %}} - sinful creation that's why we talk about God being in the third heaven and not being on Earth even though we know as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1786" display="29:46" %}} - will soon discuss that God is everywhere so if God is everywhere why do we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1792" display="29:52" %}} - he's in the third heaven it's because the the father himself who is the represent of the deity of the of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1800" display="30:00" %}} - Trinity is maintaining a perceptible separation from sinful  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - creation but the holy spirit is currently right here on Earth he's living in believers who are sinful he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1814" display="30:14" %}} - working in a world that is sinful he is restraining evil in a wicked world is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1820" display="30:20" %}} - that in any way violating anything the Bible says now I would I would make a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1826" display="30:26" %}} - point in and say whenever we see these things we don't think the way that a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1832" display="30:32" %}} - Believer should should go about it is not to think what is wrong here and rather to think what am I not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1839" display="30:39" %}} - understanding here so the holy spirit is in a sinful world the lord Jesus came  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1847" display="30:47" %}} - and he lived in the world died on the cross was raised from the dead and after  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1855" display="30:55" %}} - after he ascended into heaven heos is ended which meant his human nature and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1861" display="31:01" %}} - his divine nature were perfectly United in each other so when you consider all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1868" display="31:08" %}} - of that when you take all of that into consideration you we we come to understand that when the Bible says no  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1874" display="31:14" %}} - man may see my face and let that's in Exodus 33:20 by the way no man may see my face and and live you cannot see my  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1882" display="31:22" %}} - face for no man may see me and live that's how um the Lord said it what was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1888" display="31:28" %}} - being said is you are not permitted to see the representation of the deity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1894" display="31:34" %}} - the Trinity that's why the father is the face of the Trinity but then he told  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1899" display="31:39" %}} - Abraham he told Moses sorry um I will put you in a c and when I have passed by  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1904" display="31:44" %}} - and and place my hand on you so that you do not see my face but when I have passed by I will let I will let you see  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1910" display="31:50" %}} - my back right so that's that that one was interesting because in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1917" display="31:57" %}} - it would seem that the Lord Jesus would be this back so to speak because he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1923" display="32:03" %}} - the one who is facing creation remember that he was someone was walking in the Garden of Eden and the Bible said it was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1930" display="32:10" %}} - the Lord God with Adam and Eve and just as we have what as we have said the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1936" display="32:16" %}} - Bible records that they saw the god of Israel and ate and drank that's what the Bible actually records that this was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1942" display="32:22" %}} - referring to the 70 elders of Israel so all of these things tell that they saw somebody that was part of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1950" display="32:30" %}} - Trinity but there's someone they were not permitted to get in any contact with and that was the father we will see this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1957" display="32:37" %}} - playing out again when we talk about um the third heaven and uh Paradise when uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1964" display="32:44" %}} - Believers before the cross would die they couldn't go into the third heaven but they were in some place that was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1970" display="32:50" %}} - actually pleasurable that was delightful it was like a Garden of Eden of it Stone  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1976" display="32:56" %}} - it was Paradise Jesus called it paradise and he also called it Abraham's bosom it's the place from where Samuel  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1983" display="33:03" %}} - ascended when Saul um went to a a a uh a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1990" display="33:10" %}} - medium and asked to have him raised up to speak with him that's the same place  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1995" display="33:15" %}} - that um Abraham was found it's the same place that uh Lazarus as the poor man  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2001" display="33:21" %}} - the poor believer was also found it's the same place that Jesus went to after he he died on the cross and the reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2009" display="33:29" %}} - for this this separation was because sinful man may not enter the presence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2015" display="33:35" %}} - the father even though they had communion with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit fell on many prophets even before Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2022" display="33:42" %}} - went to the cross and Jesus himself came and ate and drank and interacted with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2029" display="33:49" %}} - his disciples even though he was also God but the father nobody ever saw him  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2035" display="33:55" %}} - that's also the testimony of John no nobody ever saw him except the son that's what he said so when when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2042" display="34:02" %}} - think about these things that God dwells in unapproachable light and all of that we are supposed to understand the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2048" display="34:08" %}} - separation that exists between the father as a representation of the deity of the Trinity and sinful creation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2057" display="34:17" %}} - this is why we look forward to Resurrection that's why we look forward to the putting off of this body because  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2063" display="34:23" %}} - when we put off this body of sin there is no especially because Jesus has now died on the cross for us there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2069" display="34:29" %}} - longer any reason we cannot enter into the presence of the father so that's yeah I will say the the powerfulness of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2077" display="34:37" %}} - us not actually being able to commune with God in the third heaven is any believers who died until after the cross  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2084" display="34:44" %}} - it makes sense when you think of things in terms of justification um before the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2089" display="34:49" %}} - cross people were saved essentially on credit looking forward towards Christ sacrifice so all human beings from Adam  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2095" display="34:55" %}} - to the last person who who ever lived will be saved on account of their sin being paid for by Christ but the cross  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2102" display="35:02" %}} - is you know thousands of years into human history so what about all the people before the cross well they were  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2108" display="35:08" %}} - in this place that AI described but they could actually be in the presence of the father after Christ's Resurrection  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2115" display="35:15" %}} - because the resurrection represents God's acceptance of Christ's payment for our sins so after that point in a manner  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2121" display="35:21" %}} - of speaking God didn't see those people anymore he saw them through the blood of Jesus Christ and that's why they could  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2127" display="35:27" %}} - be in the presence of the father um because no longer was their sin tainting them because they'd been covered in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2134" display="35:34" %}} - blood of Christ now also of course uh in the new heavens and the new Earth the father will come and live among us so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2141" display="35:41" %}} - it's not just going to be um the son Among Us and the Holy Spirit indwelling us but we will be in the presence of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2147" display="35:47" %}} - father but that's only in the new heavens and the new earth once sin has be been completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2153" display="35:53" %}} - eradicated right so yeah um one other uh comment we had here on light and Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2159" display="35:59" %}} - um to go over was uh this one here about how the visible form of Christ's Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2165" display="36:05" %}} - was veiled in his first Advent to make the choice for him genuine um so the glory was revealed in his works and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2172" display="36:12" %}} - words some of the signs he did definitely manifesting the glory of the almighty um but by way of contrast when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2180" display="36:20" %}} - Jesus Christ comes again I believe it's in uh let me let me check myself on this whoops um I think it's in Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2187" display="36:27" %}} - chapter 19 um Revelation 19 is talking about the second coming of Christ um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2194" display="36:34" %}} - when he comes the second time uh let me see if I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2201" display="36:41" %}} - right am I right maybe I'm not yeah here he comes coming on a horse horse right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2207" display="36:47" %}} - um so when Jesus Christ comes again you know defeating the armies of the Antichrist and Armageddon um and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2213" display="36:53" %}} - judgment commences you know the the day of judgment so uh that Paradigm in scripture the day of the Lord Paradigm  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2220" display="37:00" %}} - if you're familiar with how Dr lugan Bill explains this in terms of Prophecy uh well on that day um then every knee  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2227" display="37:07" %}} - will bow and every tongue will confess that's a quote I believe it's from Timothy Thessalonians I can I can look  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2234" display="37:14" %}} - up the exact ver every KN every knee well that's that's in Philippians  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2239" display="37:19" %}} - chapter two Philippians yeah okay you're right Philippians 21-1 but that happens on the day of the Lord Paradigm um in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2246" display="37:26" %}} - ology this is the point in which yeah the veil comes off and we behold Christ's Glory as it is and at that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2253" display="37:33" %}} - point even unbelievers will not by their own will but because it is they can't deny it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2261" display="37:41" %}} - right you know God allows human Hardness of Heart to persist but they cannot deny the glory of God when he comes in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2267" display="37:47" %}} - manner um so they too will bow and their tongues will confess the glory of God because it will be manifest it will be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2275" display="37:55" %}} - something that you can't Harden your eyes to um and that will only happen at  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2280" display="38:00" %}} - that point in time um until now God lets Humanity persist in Hardness of Heart  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2286" display="38:06" %}} - but that will not be the case at that point in time yeah in in fact I I want to point  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2295" display="38:15" %}} - out that okay this is an an argument I used to make a few years ago I when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2301" display="38:21" %}} - people would say why doesn't God just show me himself why do a lot of atheists would argue  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2307" display="38:27" %}} - why does God need me why does God need you the Christian to argue for his existence so that I can believe why  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2314" display="38:34" %}} - doesn't he just show me himself so one very strong reason for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2319" display="38:39" %}} - this is actually that the same thing that we started with the isness of God the God is Ultimate Reality that is to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2329" display="38:49" %}} - say when you think about math for example math is um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2337" display="38:57" %}} - an a way to reason abstractly about the physical world  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2343" display="39:03" %}} - so you can talk all you want about x's and y's and calculus and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2349" display="39:09" %}} - whatnot it doesn't really mean it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't do much  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2354" display="39:14" %}} - until you actually start to bring those things to bear on physical systems that you interact with and that's the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2362" display="39:22" %}} - point math gives you a way of seeing those things mentally so that you can  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2368" display="39:28" %}} - act on them physically a lot of the things about life as we see them is similar to math  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2375" display="39:35" %}} - in that sense but God is the Ultimate Reality if anyone of us were to see God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2382" display="39:42" %}} - with his glory unveiled that is himself naked as as it can  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - get we would fail to be able to resist his will that's just how that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2396" display="39:56" %}} - it's like when the Sun rises and the Darkness recedes and all Shadows flee  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2404" display="40:04" %}} - that's exactly what happens when the glory of God is unveiled this is also  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2410" display="40:10" %}} - something I should have mentioned when I was talking about the unapproachable light issue that God veils himself in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2417" display="40:17" %}} - his interactions with with um with creation such that even even though the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2422" display="40:22" %}} - people of old were largely interacting with Jesus Christ himself he's Glory as deity was still veiled which is again to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2429" display="40:29" %}} - tell to remind us that it is the father who plays the role of the deity of the representation of the deity of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2435" display="40:35" %}} - Trinity the other two the the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit Veil their own Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2441" display="40:41" %}} - tremendously we have to understand that it's like with the father he is the one who does not Veil it in that sense so if  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2450" display="40:50" %}} - we were to walk into the presence of the father in sin we we would really die but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2456" display="40:56" %}} - we can interact with the son we can interact with the holy spirit because they have given us it's like the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2462" display="41:02" %}} - Spirit actually living in a human being in in a Believer sorry okay so um it's like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2469" display="41:09" %}} - Holy Spirit actually living in a Believer and um in that same believer he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2474" display="41:14" %}} - would be speaking and the believer can ignore what he is saying the miracle of that is sometimes beyond our ability to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2481" display="41:21" %}} - even perceive it's impossible to resist God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2487" display="41:27" %}} - when God himself has decided that he will not be resisted can I can I read this verse from Isaiah 53 I just man  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2494" display="41:34" %}} - this hit me when you were talking here um this is talking now Isaiah 53 is the prophecy of the suffering servant which  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2500" display="41:40" %}} - we now know to be Jesus Christ but just listen to this for a second in terms of the veiled Majesty of God right so this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2507" display="41:47" %}} - is speaking of Jesus Christ as the suffering servant it says verse two he grew up before him like a tender shoot  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2513" display="41:53" %}} - and like a root out of dry ground he had no stately form or Majesty to attract us  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2518" display="41:58" %}} - no beauty that we should desire him he was despised and rejected by Men A Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief like  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2525" display="42:05" %}} - one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2531" display="42:11" %}} - not just just no stately former Majesty to attract this right this is why it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2536" display="42:16" %}} - always been about faith for us because we G it's not like Jesus Christ came and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2543" display="42:23" %}} - you know he was like a a Standing Tall among men you know with beauty outshining the rest and abilities So  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2552" display="42:32" %}} - Glorious that people had to fall down before him right um you get some of this in fiction when people are talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2558" display="42:38" %}} - the Majesty of Kings you know Emperors maybe I maybe it depends on culture a bit because you know in the Far East  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2564" display="42:44" %}} - some of them actually worship their Emperors as Gods but you know this idea of Regal Majesty that just people find  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2572" display="42:52" %}} - irresistible yeah Jesus when in during the Incarnation Jesus did not have that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2578" display="42:58" %}} - and so when you think about those that followed him and were willing to die for him they belied who he was in his kosis  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2586" display="43:06" %}} - um his Veil deity not because Jesus was so exceptional as a human being um yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2594" display="43:14" %}} - yeah so that's that's the thing the the the matter of of the glory of the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2602" display="43:22" %}} - and this is one thing that actually struck me in uh the way that EX presented that God is light so if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2609" display="43:29" %}} - were to actually speak of God in terms of substance that is what he is made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2614" display="43:34" %}} - of course that that we should remember that that's nonsensical language to speak there is no God is made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2619" display="43:39" %}} - anything but he would be light that would be the definition of him and think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2625" display="43:45" %}} - about this when Jesus returns the Bible speaks of him as rising like the sun and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - when we go to Zechariah 14 and it talks about how the moment of his of his is returned to the Earth will be it says at  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - that time will be neither day nor night the reason for this is that it's actually in the middle of the day when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2644" display="44:04" %}} - it should be light out it would be dark like it's midnight and then he rises and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2651" display="44:11" %}} - when he rises the Brilliance of his Rising is far brighter than anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2657" display="44:17" %}} - anyone has ever seen of the sun now think about Jesus Christ being the Morning Star too right exactly the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2665" display="44:25" %}} - Morning Star yes and this this is yeah this is the glory of his deity we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2672" display="44:32" %}} - the glory we're talking about is visibly resplendant its light beaming through  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2680" display="44:40" %}} - and this is actually what God is actually promising to every believer and it is the angels are already  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2686" display="44:46" %}} - experiencing it at the moment and departed Believers are experiencing it too he shares That Glory with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2692" display="44:52" %}} - us that we too will shine like Stars this is what Daniel says or the angel  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2697" display="44:57" %}} - told Daniel in Daniel chapter 12 that they will shine like stars in their father's Kingdom so we are to understand  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2705" display="45:05" %}} - that if we were to speak of God in terms of substance what he is made of again remembering that he is not made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2712" display="45:12" %}} - anything but the substance of his deity is light and glory is the is The Shining  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2718" display="45:18" %}} - forth of that light yeah and so that that is also to tell us how incredibly  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2724" display="45:24" %}} - amazing and and Powerful f it is that that light could walk among men and not be seen as light I mean how about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2731" display="45:31" %}} - about John chapter one right and yeah the light walked among the darkness and the Darkness did not recognize it right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2738" display="45:38" %}} - um yes exactly exactly yeah yeah so that's that's what I would say to to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2745" display="45:45" %}} - that yeah I just wanted to bring up the um the first U day of creation when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2751" display="45:51" %}} - there was no sun but there was light y yeah in that case I would always be care  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2757" display="45:57" %}} - I would try to remind people that God God does not need to be the light himself he can create light without  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2762" display="46:02" %}} - actually you know um having his son shining it through and there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2768" display="46:08" %}} - difference between created light and the light that is actually God that's that's something we see creation but Lisa's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2775" display="46:15" %}} - Point's actually very interesting too uh not to get too far a few because we could get very off topic here but why was the universe dark right what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2782" display="46:22" %}} - talking about is one of the strongest inferential Arguments for or uh Genesis  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2787" display="46:27" %}} - being Recreation you know that teaching of the Gap theory on nius is because if God is a being of light as we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2794" display="46:34" %}} - it's a substance you know waving our hand at what that means precisely but if God is light then why was the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2802" display="46:42" %}} - dark it doesn't make sense unless the universe had been judged before um now I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2807" display="46:47" %}} - want to close this out I we've been on this man we have hit this one hard I am glad though this has been good stuff I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2813" display="46:53" %}} - want to read this passage here from or second second Corinthians chapter 3 so we are on this topic of light and glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2820" display="47:00" %}} - and specifically this idea of bailing and what it means for us as Believers too so this is talking about the New  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2826" display="47:06" %}} - Covenant picking up in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 7 so I'm just go ahead and read from verse 7 through Verse 18 I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2833" display="47:13" %}} - think it's all pretty relevant here as you guys will see and I think that's where we'll close this section so we can actually get through the third one in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2839" display="47:19" %}} - this video um but all very appropo to our discussion of Glory here so 2  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2846" display="47:26" %}} - Corinthians chapter 3 picking up at verse 7 says now if the ministry that brought death which was engraved in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2852" display="47:32" %}} - letters on Stone came with Glory so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2858" display="47:38" %}} - Glory transitory though it was will not the ministry of the spirit be even more  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2863" display="47:43" %}} - glorious if the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious how much more glorious is the ministry that brings  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2869" display="47:49" %}} - righteousness for what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with The surpassing Glory and if what was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2876" display="47:56" %}} - transitory came with Glory how much greater is the glory of that which lasts  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2881" display="48:01" %}} - therefore since we have such a hope we are very bold we are not like Moses who would put a veil over his face to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2888" display="48:08" %}} - prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away but their minds were made dull for to this day the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2895" display="48:15" %}} - same Veil remains when the old Covenant is read it has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away even to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2902" display="48:22" %}} - this day when Moses is read a veil covers their heart s but whenever anyone turns to the Lord the veil is taken away  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2910" display="48:30" %}} - now the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom and we all who with unveiled faces  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2917" display="48:37" %}} - contemplate the Lord's Glory are being transformed into his image with ever increasing Glory which comes from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2923" display="48:43" %}} - Lord who is the spirit amen right um so we are being transformed to reflect  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2930" display="48:50" %}} - God's glory we are reflectors of God's glory right through the indwelling ministry of the Holy Spirit now I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2937" display="48:57" %}} - there is one more thing so we're going to pause for a second and see if there's one more thing to talk about and then we'll finish off this section here all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2944" display="49:04" %}} - right well I think we decided that actually we talked a good bit about this topic so with this we're going to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2951" display="49:11" %}} - ahead and move on to the next thing here talking about the essence and nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2959" display="49:19" %}} - God all right so when we talk about some of these terms like Essence and nature  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2965" display="49:25" %}} - and character and if you've ever read any philosophy you might have also come across form and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2970" display="49:30" %}} - substance um well what are these things what's the difference between them and do we need to care about the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2977" display="49:37" %}} - throughout history many philosophers and theologians who dabble in philosophy like Thomas aquinus is a famous one they  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2984" display="49:44" %}} - argue about these things also comes up a lot in uh Catholic and Orthodox theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2989" display="49:49" %}} - where they talk about uh the son being eternally begotten of the father in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2995" display="49:55" %}} - Spirit eternally proceeding from the father and all of these other things that they talk about in terms of ontology I don't really want us to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3002" display="50:02" %}} - there because I feel like we get a bit off topic but um we're just going to talk a little bit about what does it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3008" display="50:08" %}} - mean for something to be essential you know what is an essential characteristic of something um and so when you ask the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3015" display="50:15" %}} - question about well what's the difference between nature and Essence right uh debate that people have had for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3020" display="50:20" %}} - a long time or substance or form or these other things arguments usually seem to hinge on how quote unquote  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3027" display="50:27" %}} - inherent something is to an object so for example a triangle must have three sides otherwise it's no longer a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3033" display="50:33" %}} - triangle so things that are essential and here this kind of blew my mind when I saw it if you compare the word essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3040" display="50:40" %}} - to essential right essential things are things that you have to have that compose the essence of something right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3046" display="50:46" %}} - they have the same root coming from that Greek word here and so essential things  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3052" display="50:52" %}} - are things without which an object is not whatever we are saying so if you want to use a fany jargony word that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3058" display="50:58" %}} - would be ontologically speaking right in terms of Something's existence if it does not have the essential properties  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3064" display="51:04" %}} - the essential characteristics it is not the thing that we are talking about so there's this blink here um I certainly  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3071" display="51:11" %}} - don't know very much about this website I was just coming up with an example and I thought this page did a decent job um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3076" display="51:16" %}} - you know this guy saying he's not a philosopher Etc um but he's using the example of circles right so if you draw  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3083" display="51:23" %}} - a circle over here like this one if you draw one on the other side of a page still a circle right location is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3090" display="51:30" %}} - we're going to call an accidental trait of a circle right it's not something that where if you change the location  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3096" display="51:36" %}} - something ceases to become a circle now if you draw one that's blue right color is also not an essential trait of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3102" display="51:42" %}} - circle because you can have circles that are different colors and they're all still circles right um so circles can have a lot of different accidental  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3108" display="51:48" %}} - traits but if you take this object right here this is not a circle right a circle  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3115" display="51:55" %}} - with four Four Corners can you have a circle with Corners no now you don't have a circle anymore you have a square  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3120" display="52:00" %}} - because round is an essential trait of a circle so I don't want to overly belabor the point I don't want to stick it off  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3126" display="52:06" %}} - in the weeds of philosophy but we're just talking a little bit about well what does it mean for something to have essential characteristics what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3133" display="52:13" %}} - Essence that sort of thing now where this kind of comes more on topic for us is when people argue about is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3141" display="52:21" %}} - infinity and his perfect character are these essential characteristics of God that is God not be God if he didn't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3148" display="52:28" %}} - these characteristics now I'm mostly introducing this because people argue about this my opinion is that wandering  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3155" display="52:35" %}} - too far in this direction rapidly leads one to something called theosophy which is usually kind of a pejorative way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3161" display="52:41" %}} - saying you're off in the philosophical Weeds about something in theology when you should just accept what the Bible says and move on right so God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3169" display="52:49" %}} - infinite and god is perfect in character so why are we arguing about this stuff right does it matter what does it mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3176" display="52:56" %}} - if this is an essential characteristic of God or not right I think a lot of the times people get off in the Weeds about this and it doesn't do much productive  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3183" display="53:03" %}} - that's my n equals one opinion here now if someone in this were to wh that I'm kind of question dodging and I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3188" display="53:08" %}} - defining my terms I'm just using things I would say that God's nature deals with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3193" display="53:13" %}} - his infinite abilities and God's character deals with his moral perfection and both are fundamental  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3199" display="53:19" %}} - parts of who he is as God um I don't know if that would uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3205" display="53:25" %}} - you know if that would satisfy all potential critics and I'm quite frankly not all that interested in satisfying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3211" display="53:31" %}} - potential critics here we are talking about who God really is not whether it conforms to a specific philosophical  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3218" display="53:38" %}} - framework or you know a definition of terms as this philosopher this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - philosopher say Plato or Kant or whoever else uses these terms we're interested about who God really is and that is kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3229" display="53:49" %}} - of what's governing in our conversation here so um I'm sorry that's maybe a little bit unsatisfying I'm more raising  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3235" display="53:55" %}} - this to say we're not going to go too far into some of the philosophical weeds  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3241" display="54:01" %}} - here we're going to keep it at the surface level about who God really is what his abilities are what that says  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3246" display="54:06" %}} - about his nature and his moral perfection in his character um so nature his infinite nature and his perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3252" display="54:12" %}} - character those are the uh the next lessons that we're actually going to do um but I'm just kind of opening up that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3258" display="54:18" %}} - that's what we care about when we talk about the essence of God we don't have to twist ourselves into pretzels trying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3264" display="54:24" %}} - to satisfy secular philosophers because what we're interested in is who God is not necessarily the philosophical  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3271" display="54:31" %}} - specifics and the technical terms and well how does this interact with Plato's conception of the forms or whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3276" display="54:36" %}} - right we don't need to go there because it's not really useful for enhancing our understanding of God does that make  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3282" display="54:42" %}} - sense a do you have more to say here yeah I'll just say that um one problem  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3288" display="54:48" %}} - with people like aquinus and all the others was was that they were doing philosophy they weren't you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3295" display="54:55" %}} - particularly engaging in Bible study they were trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3300" display="55:00" %}} - understand the scriptures they were trying to philosophize about God that's a different thing Al  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3306" display="55:06" %}} - together there is very much because the human mind is naturally arrogant um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3312" display="55:12" %}} - there's always so much we think we can we can we can break God we can figure him out and all of that but what we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3319" display="55:19" %}} - here is Bible study we're trying to to you know um understand what the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3326" display="55:26" %}} - says about God so we will be seeking to understand what the Bible says about  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3332" display="55:32" %}} - God's Essence and as far as that goes we're not talking about essential characteristics we're talking about what  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3341" display="55:41" %}} - God is and that is this we've already talked about a big part of that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3347" display="55:47" %}} - what God is at his core what and here's the thing I I often like to use the term  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3353" display="55:53" %}} - deity to to make sure that everyone understands that I'm not talking about the identity of the person that has that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3361" display="56:01" %}} - quality of deity I'm talking about the quality itself so what makes deity deity is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3369" display="56:09" %}} - we're talking about on the one hand which we have already talked about it's the fact that deity is the is it it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3376" display="56:16" %}} - never began to exist it will never cease to exist now that very word that very I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3384" display="56:24" %}} - will be what I am I am what I am I I am what I will be all of these things they  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3392" display="56:32" %}} - refer to the to the both the independent existence that is the self-existence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3398" display="56:38" %}} - that which possesses deity and also speaks to a lot of there there are implications that is what I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3404" display="56:44" %}} - mean there are there are implications of this self-existence if something self exists

{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3446" display="57:26" %}} - things about the mechanics of something or trying to fit it in a framework where I've pestered Dr lugan with questions

{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3461" display="57:41" %}} - here rather than starting with the Bible I mean he says it way nicer than that but more or less our responsibility as  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3467" display="57:47" %}} - Christians as Believers is we need to start with the Bible we need to strive to understand and interpret the Bible we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3473" display="57:53" %}} - don't start with a phrase fror and then try to like fit the Bible into that right like that's going about it backwards right um this Probably sounds

{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3527" display="58:47" %}} - yeah we're not going to do that and according to some people that will mean that we didn't quote unquote do a thorough job or whatever but whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3534" display="58:54" %}} - because we're starting with the Bible we're going to stick with the Bible and we're going to talk about what the Bible has to say in terms of God's

#### Overview {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-overview}

In terms of their presentation of the Trinity, the main difference between the Old and New Testaments is that in the New Testament, Christ is clearly visible and distinct from the Father, while in the Old Testament, the Father and Son are often difficult to distinguish. Despite the discussion immediately above, there is a common misconception â€“ even in many Christian circles â€“ that the fact that the exact details about Christ's incarnation were shielded in the Old Testament means that the *visible* person in the Old Testament is primarily God the Father.

This is not entirely accurate, for the Father has always appeared to the world *through* the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, and this fact was just as true in the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament; only the *manner* of the Father's representation of Himself through His Son changed: in the New Testament, an *incarnate* Jesus Christ becomes visible to the world (only His true glory is shielded), while in the Old Testament, Christ also represents the Father â€“ but not in *incarnate* form.

Additionally, in the New Testament, when our Lord says "I and the Father are one" (Jn.10:30), or otherwise speaks the Father's words (Jn.8:28; 14:24), the distinction between the Father and the Son (along with this unity) is perfectly clear and obvious. However, in the Old Testament, when God appears, it is consistently the Son who appears, but as the representative of the Father, speaking the Father's words, so that the distinction between the two was not, at the time, completely understood or appreciated (Jn.8:26 & 28):

#### Definition of Theophany and Christophany {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-definition-of-theophany-and-christophany}

The words "Theophany" and "Christophany" mean, respectively, "an appearance of God" and "an appearance of Christ", the second part of each being derived from the Greek root *phan*, "appear" (from which we get the word "phenomenon"). In this section it will be argued that in biblical terms, at any rate, the only category of event we really need to be concerned with here is Christophany, for, in my view, all cases of Theophany in the Old Testament are really Christophanies.

It needs to be made clear right at the outset that by Christophany we are definitely not referring to the literal, physical appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ in His true humanity â€“ ever since His deity assumed true humanity at the incarnation, Christ has not again appeared in temporary, Christophanic form. The position that all Old Testament appearances of God are, in reality, appearances of Christ, also allows for the possibility of other sorts of manifestations of the Father other than an ostensibly corporeal appearance here on earth, such as a dream or vision (Daniel's vision of the "Ancient of Days" being the prime example: Dan.7:13-14).

<!-- --- -->

#### The invisibility of the Father {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-invisibility-of-the-father}

Until we get to heaven, we will not see the Father. We know that the Father is not invisible to the angels, for they "constantly see the face of My Father in heaven" (Matt.18:10). But He is our *heavenly* Father (Matt.6:9, 26, et passim), and as long as the earthly conflict between His would-be usurper, Satan, and His designated regent, Christ, still rages, in heaven He remains for His majesty's sake, speaking and working His will through His Servant. Until the final and ultimate victory, and only after the complete purging of the universe will the Father come to the new earth to make His abode with us forever (Rev.21:1-3). Until that time, the Father, though acting and speaking through His representative, His Son Jesus Christ, remains invisible to human eye.

#### The inaccessibility of the Father apart from Christ {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-inaccessibility-of-the-father-apart-from-christ}

If mankind were able to see God the Father in all His glory without perishing in the process, it is at least safe to say that the issue of human free-will would be seriously compromised from that point forward. Confronted with the magnitude and majesty of God, not only would it be impossible to deny His existence, but it is also likely that even against their will most men would find themselves obliged to follow Him and His will out of sheer terror (rather than from a truly free choice). Along with the principle of preserving mankind's free-will, the issue of *access* to the Father also helps to explain why the Father remains unseen to us in this present life.

Although, as discussed earlier in this study, the Father is omnipresent in His creation, for purposes of visibility to His creatures, he is invariably described in the scriptures as residing in heaven (e.g., Matt.6:9, 26). Obviously, as long as we live in these physical bodies, we cannot go to heaven to "seek God" (Deut.30:12-13; Rom.10:6). The Father, by virtue of the fact that His throne room is in heaven (Rev.4:2; Heb.4:16), is inaccessible to us. This "physical" distance which separates us from the Father is indicative of the *spiritual* distance between God and mankind. As the person of the Trinity representing the authority and holiness of the Godhead, the righteous Father keeps Himself completely separate from human sin; it is in no small part because of mankind's sinfulness that face to face fellowship with the Father is impossible. In fact, for sinful human beings to be confronted by God brings immediate realization that we are worthy of death by our very nature (Gen.32:30):

{{% ichthys-translation p="Isaiah 6:5" %}}
"Woe is me! I am done for! For I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

Though we cannot go to heaven to plead our case with the Father, Christ Jesus is the one who has come down from heaven on our account (Jn.3:13). Through faith in Him and His death for us, we now have ***access*** to the Father in His name. By His blood (that is, His death on the cross on our behalf), Christ has broken down the barrier of hostility between the Father and those who believe in His Son. Jesus Christ has made peace between us, and, as a result, we now have been granted entrance into the throne room of heaven and the presence of the Father. This means that on the basis of the acceptability of Christ's sacrifice and our acceptance of Him, our prayers and petitions are heard by the Father now, and we ourselves shall enter into the heavenly holy of holies in His good time:

{{% ichthys-translation p="Romans 5:1-2a" %}}
So now that we have been justified by faith, let us take hold of the peace [we have] with God [the Father] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have also obtained our ***access*** into this grace in which we stand.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Ephesians 2:18" %}}
For through Him [Jesus Christ] we both [Jews and gentiles] have ***access*** to the Father by one Spirit.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

{{% ichthys-translation p="Ephesians 3:12" %}}
Being in Him [Jesus Christ] and having confidence through our faith in Him we possess this ***access*** [to the Father] and freedom to speak [to Him].
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Hebrews 4:16" %}}
So let us ***approach*** with confident free speech to the throne of grace [of the Father] that we might receive [His] mercy and gain [His] favor for timely help.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="1 Peter 3:18" %}}
For Christ died once for us on account of our sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might ***bring*** us to God.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

The fact that through faith in the Son we now have full ***access*** to the Father (sonship, fellowship, acceptance of prayer, and eternal life with Him), shows that before the Son came and died for us, such access was at least *limited*. The Father's splitting of the temple's veil at the conclusion of our Lord's sacrifice on our behalf is a dramatic indication that through His death the barrier that had previously separated us from the Father (that is, our sins) has now been removed (Lk.23:45). Now we have access to the Father in prayer, though we still cannot enter into His presence in heaven as long as we remain in these earthly bodies. Before the cross, the Father was even more inaccessible to sinful mankind. It would be surprising, therefore, if the instances of Theophany in the Old Testament are actual appearances of the Father. It is much more likely (based upon this principle of greater access *after* the cross, less beforehand) that just as the Father made Himself known through His Son in the New Testament (Heb.1:1-2), so also in the Old Testament His appearances were mediated by this same Son, that is to say, by Christophany.

<!-- --- -->

#### The dignity of the Father {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-dignity-of-the-father}

The fact that the angelic rebellion led by Satan precedes the creation of man (Job 38:7; Is.14:12-15; Ezek.28:12-19) explains much about the Father's modus operandi of working through the One who will ultimately replace Satan as ruler of this world, His Son Jesus Christ (Lk.10:18; Jn.12:31; 16:11; 1Cor.15:24-25; Col.2:15; Rev.11:15). As the Trinity's figure of authority and majesty, the Father chooses a representative to wage the struggle against Satan, even He who by His sacrifice will redeem sinful mankind and replace our adversary, the Morning Star replacing Lucifer (compare Is.14:12 with Rev.22:16). So it should not be surprising that throughout the Old Testament too, the Son is the One representing the Father, speaking His words whenever He appears (in Christophany), for He is the anointed One, the Messiah, the One sent into the world by the Father (Matt.10:40; 21:37; Lk.9:48; 10:16; Jn.12:44; 13:20). This principle of the Son *representing* the Father as His agent in the plan of salvation can also be seen from Christ's...

<!-- --- -->

1) **Message**: Christ is the Word (Jn.1:1-3). This means that He is the embodiment of the message and truth of the Father, and speaks the Father's words truly and precisely at all times (Deut.18:18; Jn.8:55; 14:10&24). Christ is the Father's ultimate message (Heb.1:1), the messenger of the Father's new covenant in His blood (Is.42:6; Jer.31:31ff.; Mal.3:1; Matt.26:28; 1Cor.11:25).

2) **Mediation**: Christ is the Mediator between God the Father and sinful mankind (Gal.3:19-20; 1Tim.2:5), the One who reconciles us to the Father by His blood (Rom.5:10-11; 2Cor.5:18-21; Eph.2:14-16; Col.1:20-22).

3) **Mission**: Christ is the One anointed and sent by the Father to offer Himself as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb.9:11-14). He is thus the ultimate high priest who makes atonement to the Father on our behalf (Heb.5:5-10).

4) **Monarchy**: In recognition of His victory at the cross, the Father has "appointed Him Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36), that is "the Lord anointed (to rule the world)". This passage signals not only Christ's replacement of Satan as ruler of the world, but His acceptance of the regency of the world as the Father's representative (explaining many Old Testament passages referring to the Father's impending return being applied to the Son in the New Testament):

a) the Son's ascension into heaven (Ps.110:1 with Matt.22:44);  
b) the Son's ascension to the throne on earth (Ps.45:6-7 with Heb.1:8-9);  
c) the Son's primacy from creation to eternity (Ps.97:7b with Heb.1:6).  

All the above examples of Christ's role of *representing* the Father in God's plan of salvation support the position that all Old Testament Theophany is truly Christophany, the Son appearing, representing, and speaking for the Father before His incarnation.

<!-- --- -->

#### The visibility, accessibility and humility of the Son {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-visibility-accessibility-and-humility-of-the-son}

While we cannot initially see the Father, we can see the Son and the Father through the Son (Jn.14:9). While we could not initially approach the Father, through the Son we have gained access to Him (Jn.14:6). And while our sinfulness kept us separated from the perfect holiness of the Father, the work of the Son has rendered us holy and has reconciled us to the Father (Col.1:22). As the visible, accessible member of the Trinity who was willing to humble Himself and associate with us to die for us (Phil.2:5-11), Christ has always been our point of contact with the Godhead, whether in Old Testament Christophany, or after His appearance in true humanity following His incarnation.
