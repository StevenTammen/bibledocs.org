### Summary {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be kicking off our new study of BB1: Theology on Ichthys by starting to discuss the Essence of God. We'll talk about how God is being (Exodus 3:14-15), as well as exactly what essence means as a concept.

#### The essence of God is being. He is the Great I AM {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-essence-of-god-is-being-he-is-the-great-i-am}

The essence of something is what it really is. "Essence" and "being" are precise synonyms.

God tells us who He is in Exodus 3:14-15.

If you've ever thought about the question "Well, if the universe exists because God made it, then why does God exist? Did something or someone likewise make God?" then the answer is no---God exists simply because God *is* being.

Unbelievers scoff at that logic, but it is what the Bible says.

<!-- --- -->

#### The resplendence of God: light and glory {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-resplendence-of-god-light-and-glory}

Loosely speaking, light captures the sense that God is sublime and unapproachable (compare squinting at the sun, being blinded by it), while glory represents the side that shines forth visibly to mankind.

God's glory is most directly revealed to mankind through His Son, Jesus Christ. As Hebrews 1:1-3 makes clear.

<!-- --- -->

##### Q: 1 Timothy 6:16 talks about God's unapproachable light. It also says God alone possess immortality. What does that latter statement mean? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-1-timothy-6-16-talks-about-god-s-unapproachable-light-it-also-says-god-alone-possess-immortality-what-does-that-latter-statement-mean}

When 1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God possess immortality, what about the fact that both humans and angels have eternal existence?

Is it that God *owns* immortality, but that he gives it to us creatures such that we too now possess it (some to eternal life, and some to eternal death, based upon that which we choose)? Is this another aspect of God's Uniqueness?

<!-- --- -->

##### Q: We say God dwells in this unapproachable light that no one has seen nor ever can see. What then of cases in scripture where people seem to have "seen God?" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-we-say-god-dwells-in-this-unapproachable-light-that-no-one-has-seen-nor-ever-can-see-what-then-of-cases-in-scripture-where-people-seem-to-have-seen-god}

Did Moses not see this light upon Mount Sinai? What about the Apostles present on the mount of transfiguration? What about Paul on the road to Damascus? What about John in His visions of God, recorded in Revelation?

<!-- --- -->

##### Comment: God's glory as it relates to "every knee will bow, and every tongue confess" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-comment-god-s-glory-as-it-relates-to-every-knee-will-bow-and-every-tongue-confess}

{{% note %}}
This is a video-only section.
{{% /note %}}

The visible form of this glory was veiled in Christ's first advent to make the choice for Him genuine. The glory was, however, revealed in His words and works.

Compare: "Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess." That is not now, but eventually.

<!-- --- -->





#### Essence, nature, character... ??? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-essence-nature-character}

If you've ever been confused about what the difference between nature and essence is (and we may as well throw form and substance in the mix as well), you are in good company. Philosophers have been arguing about these things for a very long time (compare Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and others).

Arguments usually seem to hinge on how "inherent" something is to an object. For example, a triangle must have three sides, otherwise it is no longer a triangle. Things that are "essential" (compare the word essence!) are things without which the object is not whatever we are saying it is.

Compare this link: https://chrismlegg.com/2018/06/19/what-do-essence-and-nature-mean-a-simple-explanation/

<!-- --- -->

So, on our topic, must God be infinite and perfect in character to be God? Are these essential characteristics of God?

It is my opinion that wandering too far in this direction rapidly leads one to theosophy (in the negative sense). God *is* infinite and perfect in character. So what were we arguing about again?

If someone were to whine that I am question-dodging and not defining terms, I would say that God's nature deals with His infinite abilities, God's character deals with His moral perfection, and both are fundamental parts of who He is as God.

### Content {#god-s-infinite-nature-content}

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm)

#### Introduction: God's infinite nature {#god-s-infinite-nature-introduction-god-s-infinite-nature}

Key point: God's nature is infinite. *Infinite*.

God's infinity – infinity in every way and according to any conceivable true standard – is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His abilities*.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Spiritual {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-spiritual}

God's being transcends the physical universe. He is not limited or bounded by material issues or concerns. God is not subject to matter in any way. God is not made of matter – God created matter and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Eternal {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-eternal}

God's being transcends time. He is not limited or bounded by temporal issues or concerns. God is not subject to time in any way. God is not constrained by time – God created time and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Immeasurable (in a spatial sense) {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-immeasurable-in-a-spatial-sense}

God's being transcends space. He is not limited or bounded by spatial issues or concerns. God is not subject to space in any way. God is not confined by space – God created space and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Unique {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-unique}

Uniqueness comes from God's infinite nature. No one else in the universe can reasonably be compared to Him. He is absolutely unique within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His spirituality, eternity and immeasurability. From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence.

<!-- --- -->

| Essential Quality                               | Manifesting in creation as                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being spiritual (rather than bound by matter)   | Omnipotence (God may affect material creation however he pleases)                                                     |
| Being eternal (rather than bound by time)       | Omniscience (God knows everything in creation from beginning to end, and even what could have been)                   |
| Being immeasurable (rather than bound by space) | Omnipresence (God is ever-present in creation: as far as the East is from the West, nothing can separate us from God) |

While we may not be properly able to fully grasp God's true nature since we are small, finite beings bound by spacetime, it should nonetheless be clearly apparent that it is not possible for any created creature to compare with the Creator. Even creatures far more powerful than ourselves -- Satan and the other angels -- are bound and limited in ways God is not, leaving God completely alone and unique in His transcendence of and supremacy within the physical universe.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Omnipotent {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omnipotent}

God is all-powerful, irrespective of matter. He can effect anything He desires in the material realm, and nothing can transpire apart from His will. Therefore there is no deed, nor was there ever, nor will there ever be which God is unable to do, small or great.

<!-- --- -->

{{% sidenote %}}

You may have come across something like "So, could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" This is (supposedly) pitting two aspects of omnipotence against each other: God's ability to create anything He wishes *ex nihilo*, and God's strength.

People argue that the two superlatives mandated by omnipotence contradict each other. Supposedly, if God cannot create an object too heavy for Him to lift, he is not omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to create anything. And likewise, if there would exist some object that God could create but was unable to lift, then He also would not be omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to lift everything. "See!", they say, "either way, He cannot do something; therefore, He is not omnipotent!"

We can let people who wish to not believe on account such an argument go on their merry way. We needn't take them up on the debate. For it is *obvious* that God can both create whatsoever He wishes, and also manipulate His creation in whatever ways He wishes. The idea of a material object He cannot create is definitionally impossible, and so too a material object He cannot manipulate. Put differently, there is no such thing as an object He could create but not lift, or an object He could lift but not create. So the entire objection is circular by assuming such a thing can exist to begin with. That is, they've already put God in a box from the very beginning, and then only proceed to smugly knock down nothing but a straw man.

<!-- --- -->

My counsel would be to avoid all such nonsense. God can do "it", whatever "it" may be. Always. We follow אֵל שַׁדַּי, *El Shaddai*, God Almighty, He who was, and is, and is to come---He who holds the strings of the universe in His hands, and can create or annihilate galaxies in the blink of an eye. And we'd better fear that power and majesty as we ought, to keep our lives in perspective. We are tiny compared to the vastness of the Earth, much less our solar system, much less our galaxy, much less the universe. But God is even bigger (infinitely bigger), and could snuff them all out in the blink of an eye if He decided to. *That* is the kind of power in view when we speak of God being omnipotent. Not that He will actually snuff out the universe on a whim, but that it would be nothing for Him to do so, since He is in complete control of matter, time, and space... and things only exist because *He* causes them to exist.

{{% /sidenote %}}

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Omniscient {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omniscient}

God is all-knowing, irrespective of time. He can effect anything He desires in the temporal realm. Therefore God knows, always has known and always will know everything, the end from the beginning. As the Everlasting One (Ps.90:2; 90:4), His knowledge of every event that ever has or will or even could occur within His creation is comprehensive and absolute.

<!-- --- -->

The "could occur" bit is important. God's knowledge of all possible hypotheticals is sometimes discussed in terms of so-called ["Molinism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism) and "middle knowledge". I prefer to discuss it independent from all the baggage there, however.

Here's an example: if the Bible says that God will never test us past what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), then that implies He knows what we would and would not be able to bear. He wouldn't be able to perfectly test us to refine our faith unless He knew all information like this.

Same deal with perfectly disciplining us, and plenty of other matters besides. Put simply, God's perfect foreordination of all things logically requires that He know everything about all potential paths in the mind-bogglingly complex decision tree that spans the history of the entire universe. It has always puzzled me why people would ever think to argue against such a notion, but alas, some people do for some reason. Perhaps it is because such a belief requires one to appreciate how truly "big" and unlike us (with our very finite perspective) God really is?

<!-- --- -->

For now, you should mostly ignore the fact that some people have again put God in a box in their minds, and content yourself with the sure confidence that God knows everything---absolutely everything, inclusive of our free-will decisions before we even make them---and is so infinitely wise as to have perfectly mapped out all of creature history before the universe was even created. There is a Perfect Divine Plan being worked out around us, and God knows very well what He is doing, rest assured.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Omnipresent {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omnipresent}

God is ever-present, irrespective of space. He can effect anything He desires in the spatial realm (Job 26:7). Therefore God has the ability, has always had and always will have, to be anywhere and everywhere, local and universal.

Of particular note is that this means God sees all. Nobody can sneak anything past God, and on that Great Day of Days, all will be revealed. It also means it is completely futile to try to run away from God. Like Jonah, we will find that no matter where we go, God and His purposes for us will always be there too.

#### Introduction: God's perfect character {#god-s-perfect-character-introduction-god-s-perfect-character}

God is perfect in His character, irreproachable and blameless in every possible way.

{{% nt t="ESV" h="300px" p="Matthew 5:48" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 5:48 | NIV11" %}}
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
{{% /scripture-h %}}

{{% scripture-l p="Matthew 5:48 | NIrV" %}}
So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /nt %}}

When firmly grasped, God's perfection – perfection in every way and according to any conceivable true standard – is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His motives*. God's perfect character will never be less than the highest, the best and the purest that the human mind can comprehend.

<!-- --- -->

#### Q: Why are we told to be perfect like God in Matthew 5:48 if we can never live up to that standard? {#god-s-perfect-character-q-why-are-we-told-to-be-perfect-like-god-in-matthew-5-48-if-we-can-never-live-up-to-that-standard}

#### God is Good {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-good}

God's character is good (Hebrew *tov*: טוב); it is the antithesis of evil. So how does goodness respond to sinful man? In His goodness, God always has our best interests at heart. Therefore His desire for us to be free from evil and devoted to good is genuine. Even though we are sinful and by nature unworthy of His blessing, in His goodness God has nevertheless found a *gracious* way to redeem us from sin without compromising His character, namely, by giving us the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Holy {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-holy}

God's character is holy (Hebrew *qadosh*: קדוש); it is completely separate from evil. So how does holiness respond to sinful man? In His holiness, God can never compromise His perfect standards for any reason. Therefore His commitment to condemning evil and rewarding good is inviolable. But even though we are sinful and by nature deserving of His judgment, in His holiness God has nevertheless found a *merciful* way to justify us in spite of our sin without violating His character, namely, by judging His Son, Jesus Christ in our place.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Faithful and True {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-faithful-and-true}

God's character is faithful and true (Hebrew: *omen*, *emeth*: אמת ,אמון); it is actively opposed to evil. So how do truth and faithfulness respond to sinful man? In His faithfulness and truth, God is entirely reliable and trustworthy in all that He promises to us and does for us. Therefore His veracity and dependability in offering us a way through Jesus Christ to escape the evil of death and embrace the good of eternal life are beyond reproach. So even though we are sinful and by nature objects of His wrath, in His faithfulness and truth God has nevertheless found a way to make *peace* between Himself and us and to remove the enmity between Himself and us, caused by our sins, without corrupting His character, namely, by reconciling us to Himself through the death of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Sovereign {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-sovereign}

Sovereignty comes from God's perfect character. No one else has a legitimate right to rule over the universe. He is the absolute sovereign within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due. Sovereignty thus speaks to God's *moral authority* and *right* to order the universe however He chooses.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His goodness, holiness and truth (essential qualities independent of His creation). From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His love, justice, and life (qualities applying to His creation which correspond to goodness, holiness and truth).

Only God is qualified to be the ultimate judge of the morally accountable creatures He has created, and thus to hold them responsible for their actions. As de facto ruler of the universe (through His perfect nature) and de jure ruler of the universe (through His perfect character):

<!-- --- -->

##### God possesses the sovereign authority to demonstrate *love* to His sinful creatures out of His own *goodness* {#god-s-perfect-character-god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-demonstrate-love-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-own-goodness}

Not ignoring their sins, as evil suggests He should, but *paying* for them Himself by the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (redemption). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **grace** (Hebrew *chen*: חן; Greek *charis*: χάρις ).

<!-- --- -->

##### God possesses the sovereign authority to administer *justice* to His sinful creatures out of His *holiness* {#god-s-perfect-character-god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-administer-justice-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-holiness}

Not abandoning them to their sins, as evil suggests He must, but *forgiving* them Himself on the basis of the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (justification). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **mercy** (Hebrew *chesed*: חסד; Greek *eleos*: ἔλεος).

<!-- --- -->

##### God possesses the sovereign authority to give *life* to His sinful creatures out of His *truth* and *faithfulness* {#god-s-perfect-character-god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-give-life-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-truth-and-faithfulness}

Not allowing them to die in their sins, as evil suggests He will, but *reconciling* them to Himself through the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (reconciliation). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **peace** (Hebrew *shalom*: שלום; Greek *eirene*: εἰρήνη).

<!-- --- -->

##### Summary: God's sovereignty in action {#god-s-perfect-character-summary-god-s-sovereignty-in-action}

| Essential Quality | Manifesting in creation as | Action God takes                  | God's sovereign attitude towards us | Result         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Goodness          | Love                       | Paying for sin                    | Grace                               | Redemption     |
| Holiness          | Justice                    | Forgiving sin                     | Mercy                               | Justification  |
| Truth             | Life                       | Reconciling sinful man to Himself | Peace                               | Reconciliation |

In this, God's full plan for saving sinful man, absolutely everything relies upon the cross, the blood of Jesus Christ. One particularly memorable way I have heard it described is that "God's Mercy and Justice intersect in the cross."

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Love {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-love}

Having love for His creatures, is a natural consequence of God's goodness. Out of the intrinsic goodness of His character, God loves us with a perfect love, desiring to help us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His holiness and justice in the process and forgive our sin without consequence (as evil suggests He should). Therefore God had to find a way to *reach out to us in love* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Grace* is the biblical name for God's policy of lovingly redeeming us from our sins through Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's gracious offer of love and redemption by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Just {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-just}

Demanding justice for His creatures is a natural consequence of God's holiness. Out of the intrinsic holiness of His character, God must deal with us in perfect justice, righteously condemning us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His goodness and love in the process and abandon us to our sins (as evil suggests He will). For God found a way to *treat us as righteous* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Mercy* is the biblical name for God's policy of justly forgiving us on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's merciful offer of justification by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Life {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-life}

Saving the lives of His creatures is a natural consequence of God's truth and faithfulness. Out of the intrinsic veracity and trustworthiness of His character, God honors His gracious and merciful promise to restore us to Himself and thereby to eternal life, delivering us from the condemnation of death accruing to us in our sinful state. In doing so, however, He has not failed to resolve the competing demands of His goodness and love on the one hand, with those of His holiness and justice on the other (as evil suggests He must). For God has found a way in accordance with His character to *eliminate the wall of sin and consequent wrath which separates us from Him*, and has done so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf (He died that we might have life). *Peace* is the biblical name for God's life-giving policy of reconciling us to Himself on the basis of the work of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's offer of life, peace and reconciliation by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

#### An overview in words {#conclusions-the-essence-of-god-an-overview-in-words}

God's goodness overflows with love, providing grace for sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says a loving God can't condemn,  
&emsp;He did condemn His Son that we might live,  
&emsp;redeeming us in love with the blood of Christ.

God's holiness overflows in justice, offering mercy to sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says a just God can't forgive,  
&emsp;He did forgive us, by condemning His own Son,  
&emsp;making us righteous through the blood of Christ.

God's faithfulness and truth overflow in life, producing peace with God for sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says that a God of integrity can't restore us,  
&emsp;He did make peace between us through His Son,  
&emsp;reconciling us to Himself and granting us eternal life on the basis of the blood of Christ.

### Summary {#introduction-the-trinity-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be starting an examination of a new topic in our study of God: the Trinity. God existing in three persons yet with one shared essence is about as core a concept as any we have in Christianity, which is one of the reasons that heresies related to the Trinity have been among the most existential of all threats to truth in the Church. This being the case, it is very important for us to understand the ins and outs of this keystone doctrine, so that we may stand firm in the truth of the Bible and its teaching.

#### The core definition of the Trinity: God is One in Essence, Three in Person {#introduction-the-trinity-the-core-definition-of-the-trinity-god-is-one-in-essence-three-in-person}

We will examine exactly what this statement means as we continue in our study, but suffice it to say that this idea of "one essence / three persons" (or "three persons / one essence" if you prefer that order to the phrasing instead) is the central point, and what you should always keep in mind when thinking about the Trinity. These two statements together sum up all that is important about the triune nature of God.

#### Is the terminology itself important in considering the development of this doctrine? {#introduction-the-trinity-is-the-terminology-itself-important-in-considering-the-development-of-this-doctrine}

In short, no. The Trinity has always been there in the Bible, for those willing to open their eyes and ears to the truth. How later people came to label the idea is in no way related to the fact that this concept has been there in scripture from day one.

{{% ichthys-translation p="Revelation 4:8" %}}
Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord, God, the Almighty  
He who was, and He who is,  
and He who is coming.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

No specific term for the triune nature of God occurs in the Bible. The inspired writers of the New Testament clearly felt that the existence of one God in three distinct persons, the doctrine which we now call "the Trinity", was a relatively straight-forward concept and accessible enough (even with a cursory reading of the scripture) from passages such as the one quoted above.

<!-- --- -->

{{% technical-discussion %}}
To flesh out a bit more why we might make the claim that Revelation 4:8 supports the doctrine of the Trinity, consider:

- The threefold repetition of the adjective Holy (Greek: [ἅγιος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g40/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *hagios*)
- The three titles used: κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ.
  - [κύριος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2962/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *kurios*, means "Lord"
  - [θεός](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *theos*, means "God"
  - [παντοκράτωρ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3841/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *pantokrater*, means "the almighty". It is a compound noun formed from the combination of [πᾶς](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3956/esv/mgnt/0-1/) and [κράτος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2904/esv/mgnt/0-1/).
- The three aspects of God's eternal existence: He who was (ὁ ἦν), and He who is (ὁ ὢν), and He who is to come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος). The first two are, respectively, the imperfect active and present active participles of [εἰμί](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1510/esv/mgnt/0-1/) (Greek's "to be" verb), and the third is a present middle participle, from [ἔρχομαι](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2064/esv/mgnt/0-1/).

Perhaps someone might say that it is not impossible or even particularly uncommon for multiple adjectives and titles to be applied to the same person. Fair enough. But one might also point out this verse's structure of threefold repetition of threes would be somewhat odd unless it were intentional, right? That is, why is it that we have three groups of threes (three Holy's, three titles, and three aspects of God's eternality) rather than some other structure like one/four (two non-three groups), or two/one/three/one (four groups, only one of which is a group of three), and so on?

The explanation that makes the most sense is simply that John, inspired by the Holy Spirit, put things this way intentionally. And therefore it ought not be ignored. QED.

The Apostolic Fathers, the generation that followed the men who actually penned the New Testament, also felt that merely quoting scriptures was an entirely adequate way of discussing the relationship between Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Not until the late second and early third centuries did the term "Trinity" itself come into general use as a way of defending (against a variety of heresies which sought to deny various aspects of the unique triune nature of God) what earlier generations of Christians had taken completely for granted based upon their common-sense approach to reading the Bible: that God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all God, and that at the same time they are – in what we may call a "personal" way – also distinct from each other.

God is one. God is also three. And there is no contradiction between these statements.

<!-- --- -->

#### Spelling it out a bit more {#introduction-the-trinity-spelling-it-out-a-bit-more}

As we have said, the core definition of the Trinity is that God is one *in essence*, and three *in person*.

To put the doctrine in complete terms, the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God; yet at the same time the Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit, the Son is not the Father or the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son.

#### Our next several discussions: understanding the Trinity in terms of what it is *not* {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-our-next-several-discussions-understanding-the-trinity-in-terms-of-what-it-is-not}

Last lesson we gave the basic definition of the Trinity: "three in person / one in essence" or "one in essence / three in person."

We can better understand what the Trinity is by first considering what it is *not* in terms of the definition given above, so that will be our focus for the next several discussions.

<!-- --- -->

#### Key point: God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that only one person of the Trinity is deity {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-key-point-god-is-one-in-essence-but-that-does-not-mean-that-only-one-person-of-the-trinity-is-deity}

God is *three* in person, and all three persons of the Trinity (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) are divine. Heresies of the past which have challenged the divinity of members of the Trinity include adoptionism (asserting that Christ is the Son of God only in the sense of adoption), the Ebionite heresy (teaching that Christ had only a human nature empowered by God's Spirit), and Unitarianism (which asserts the uni-personality of God, denying the deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit).

But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are deity. Compare: Is.63:9-14; Matt. 3:16-17; 28:19; Jn.14:16-17; 1Cor.12:4-6; 2Cor.13:14; Eph.4:4-6; 1Pet.1:1-2; Rev.1:4-6.

#### Key point: God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is only one person (merely displaying three modes or aspects of Himself) {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-distinct-persons-key-point-god-is-one-in-essence-but-that-does-not-mean-that-the-trinity-is-only-one-person-merely-displaying-three-modes-or-aspects-of-himself}

God is three in person, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are distinct persons rather than manifestations of a single, multifaceted person.

Heresies of the past which have challenged the distinct personalities of members of the Trinity include modalism (the idea that Christ and the Spirit are mere "modes" of the Father's personality), and docetism (the notion that Christ only seemed real and was in reality merely a phantom of sorts representing the Father's plan). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons.

#### Key point: God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that there is any inferiority or disparity of status, activity, or substance between the members of the Trinity {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-coequal-coeternal-and-consubstantial-key-point-god-is-three-in-person-but-that-does-not-mean-that-there-is-any-inferiority-or-disparity-of-status-activity-or-substance-between-the-members-of-the-trinity}

In any human associations, there is always inferiority or disparity of status, activity, or substance -- always. People are separate beings, and these are the simple consequences of that. However, this is not the case for God -- the Trinity shares completely perfect unity and equality.

God is *one* in essence and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are coequal, coeternal and con-substantial partners in one and the same essence. Heresies of the past which have challenged the coequality of members of the Trinity include subordinationism (which alternatively asserts that either Christ or the Spirit is by nature inferior to the Father) and Arianism (which teaches a Christ not entirely equal in divinity to the Father). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are coequal partakers of the same essence.

<!-- --- -->

##### They all possess a full and equal share of the *status* of deity {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-coequal-coeternal-and-consubstantial-they-all-possess-a-full-and-equal-share-of-the-status-of-deity}

As seen from the equal rank accorded to each in the formula for profession of faith at the point of spiritual baptism into the body of Christ:

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 28:19-20" %}}
Then Jesus came over and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me, so go and make all nations my followers by baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and by teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you."
{{% /scripture-h %}}

As seen from their joint participation in creation:

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 28:19-20" %}}
Then God said, "Let ***Us*** make man in ***Our*** image, according to ***Our*** pattern.  
{{% /scripture-h %}}

As seen from the attribution of goodness to all three members in the apostolic benediction of 2nd Corinthians, where grace (the policy of the goodness of God), love (the natural consequence [or emanation] of the goodness of God), and fellowship (the ultimate result of the goodness of God) are respectively attributed to the Son, the Father, and the Holy Spirit:

#### Key point: God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is composed of three (or more) different "gods" {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-joint-partakers-of-the-same-essence-key-point-god-is-three-in-person-but-that-does-not-mean-that-the-trinity-is-composed-of-three-or-more-different-gods}

God is *one* in essence, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are the sole, joint partakers of that same essence rather than three similar beings of similar essence. All so-called Christian sects which elevate saints and angels to the status of divinity essentially belong to this heretical category (after the manner of pagan pantheons, which also possess numerous "deities" of lesser and greater rank). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity alone share the same unique essence:
