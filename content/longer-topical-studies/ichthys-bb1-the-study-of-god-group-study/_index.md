### Summary {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be kicking off our new study of BB1: Theology on Ichthys by starting to discuss the Essence of God. We'll talk about how God is being (Exodus 3:14-15), as well as exactly what essence means as a concept.

<!-- p="Exodus 3:14-15" -->

The essence of something is what it really is. "Essence" and "being" are precise synonyms.

God tells us who He is in Exodus 3:14-15.

If you've ever thought about the question "Well, if the universe exists because God made it, then why does God exist? Did something or someone likewise make God?" then the answer is no---God exists simply because God *is* being.

Unbelievers scoff at that logic, but it is what the Bible says.

#### The resplendence of God: light and glory {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-resplendence-of-god-light-and-glory}

<a href="/subject-index/#god-resplendence-glory">God > Resplendence > Glory</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Loosely speaking, light captures the sense that God is sublime and unapproachable (compare squinting at the sun, being blinded by it), while glory represents the side that shines forth visibly to mankind.

God's glory is most directly revealed to mankind through His Son, Jesus Christ. As Hebrews 1:1-3 makes clear.

##### Q: 1 Timothy 6:16 talks about God's unapproachable light. It also says God alone possess immortality. What does that latter statement mean? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-1-timothy-6-16-talks-about-god-s-unapproachable-light-it-also-says-god-alone-possess-immortality-what-does-that-latter-statement-mean}

<!-- p="1 Timothy 6:16" -->

{{% video-only-note %}}

When 1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God possess immortality, what about the fact that both humans and angels have eternal existence?

Is it that God *owns* immortality, but that he gives it to us creatures such that we too now possess it (some to eternal life, and some to eternal death, based upon that which we choose)? Is this another aspect of God's Uniqueness?


##### Q: We say God dwells in this unapproachable light that no one has seen nor ever can see. What then of cases in scripture where people seem to have "seen God?" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-we-say-god-dwells-in-this-unapproachable-light-that-no-one-has-seen-nor-ever-can-see-what-then-of-cases-in-scripture-where-people-seem-to-have-seen-god}

{{% video-only-note %}}

Did Moses not see this light upon Mount Sinai? What about the Apostles present on the mount of transfiguration? What about Paul on the road to Damascus? What about John in His visions of God, recorded in Revelation?


##### Comment: God's glory as it relates to "every knee will bow, and every tongue confess" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-comment-god-s-glory-as-it-relates-to-every-knee-will-bow-and-every-tongue-confess}

{{< /subjects >}}

{{% video-only-note %}}

The visible form of this glory was veiled in Christ's first advent to make the choice for Him genuine. The glory was, however, revealed in His words and works.

Compare: "Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess." That is not now, but eventually.

#### Essence, nature, character... ??? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-essence-nature-character}

If you've ever been confused about what the difference between nature and essence is (and we may as well throw form and substance in the mix as well), you are in good company. Philosophers have been arguing about these things for a very long time (compare Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and others).

Arguments usually seem to hinge on how "inherent" something is to an object. For example, a triangle must have three sides, otherwise it is no longer a triangle. Things that are "essential" (compare the word essence!) are things without which the object is not whatever we are saying it is.

Compare this link: https://chrismlegg.com/2018/06/19/what-do-essence-and-nature-mean-a-simple-explanation/

<!-- --- -->

So, on our topic, must God be infinite and perfect in character to be God? Are these essential characteristics of God?

It is my opinion that wandering too far in this direction rapidly leads one to theosophy (in the negative sense). God *is* infinite and perfect in character. So what were we arguing about again?

If someone were to whine that I am question-dodging and not defining terms, I would say that God's nature deals with His infinite abilities, God's character deals with His moral perfection, and both are fundamental parts of who He is as God.

### Video/audio transcript {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-video-audio-transcript}

{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right guys so we are picking up here today in early July 2023 and we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="5" display="0:05" %}} - kicking off a new study here in the Bible basic series on ichus and so we had previously gone through part 6A  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="13" display="0:13" %}} - talking about the study of the Christian walk and we are now here picking up at the very beginning of the Bible basic  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="19" display="0:19" %}} - Series going over theology so the study of God and in our first lesson here  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="25" display="0:25" %}} - today we're going to be picking up uh introducing the the concept of the essence of God and so here's the things  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="31" display="0:31" %}} - that we are going to be talking about here uh in this first one we're going to be talking about how God is being he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="38" display="0:38" %}} - The Great I Am we have this verse in Exodus chapter 3 where he tells Moses  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="43" display="0:43" %}} - who he is his identity his Essence we're going to be talking about the resplendence of God and what that means  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="50" display="0:50" %}} - in terms of light and glory and then we're also going to talk a little bit about the difference between Essence and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="56" display="0:56" %}} - nature you may have also heard the words form and substance character what are these things you know these  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="62" display="1:02" %}} - Concepts that philosophers talk about so we'll spend a little bit of time there as  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="68" display="1:08" %}} - well all right so the first thing that we are going to be talking about is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="74" display="1:14" %}} - essence of God specifically how God is being he is The Great I Am and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - essence of something is what it really is Essence and being are precise synonyms they come from this Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="87" display="1:27" %}} - participle UIA um there's one in Latin is well very similar so Essence and being are essentially precise synonyms  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="94" display="1:34" %}} - now this is the passage here in Exodus chapter 3 where God tells us who he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="100" display="1:40" %}} - um so I'm just going to go ahead and read this uh God said to Moses I am who  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="106" display="1:46" %}} - I am and he said thus you shall say to the sons of Israel I am has sent me to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="111" display="1:51" %}} - you God furthermore said to Moses thus you shall say to the sons of Israel the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="117" display="1:57" %}} - Lord the god of your fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob has sent me to you this is my name  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="124" display="2:04" %}} - forever and this is my Memorial name to all generations and so in the Hebrew this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="130" display="2:10" %}} - word is actually it's got this really jargony technical name called the tetr Graton it means four letters in Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="136" display="2:16" %}} - that's what the Greek word taton means um but it's this unpronouncable name of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="143" display="2:23" %}} - God that's how the Hebrews viewed it the holy name of God's real identity and uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="150" display="2:30" %}} - the the translates sometimes you may see it in English as Yahweh um you know the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="155" display="2:35" %}} - the four letters here um but that gets to the idea of being in Hebrew as well  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="162" display="2:42" %}} - and so that's where this I am comes from and so this is who God says he is this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="167" display="2:47" %}} - is the fundamental essence of God is caught up in this idea of existence and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="174" display="2:54" %}} - so moving on down a bit here in the first thing we're going to talk about if you've ever thought about the question  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="180" display="3:00" %}} - of well if the universe exists because God made it that's what the Bible says  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="185" display="3:05" %}} - well then why does God exist did something or someone likewise make god well the answer to that is no God exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="192" display="3:12" %}} - simply because God is being God is existence so unbelievers kind of scoff  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="197" display="3:17" %}} - at this but it is more or less what the Bible actually says all right aie so you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="203" display="3:23" %}} - had something else you wanted to say about God being The Great I Am okay yeah um I think uh the thing I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="213" display="3:33" %}} - particularly interested in is what unbelievers say about that when you argue you know um that the there the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="221" display="3:41" %}} - question who created God or where did God come from or where was God and all of that is actually nonsense um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="229" display="3:49" %}} - the the reason that that question is nonsense is just like you said that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="235" display="3:55" %}} - is being right he is the is that which just is the I am what I am I am what I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="245" display="4:05" %}} - will be or I will be what I am however you you you you skew it the idea is this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="251" display="4:11" %}} - that I I am that which just is so the main thing I want to raise about that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="257" display="4:17" %}} - because of my um apologetic bent whenever I engage in these matters is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="263" display="4:23" %}} - this that there is there is in the very existence of anything the demand for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="269" display="4:29" %}} - something that has always existed and never had a beginning or an end that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="275" display="4:35" %}} - a fundamental requirement for anything to exist if something has not always  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="281" display="4:41" %}} - existed then nothing should exist this is exactly why currently in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="288" display="4:48" %}} - physics um those who have been who who are still holding on to the theory of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="293" display="4:53" %}} - the Big Bang are are trying to make the word nothing mean something other than  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="300" display="5:00" %}} - nothing they're insisting that nothing is not nothing that nothing is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="305" display="5:05" %}} - compressed very weird they they get very esoteric with the definition of nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="311" display="5:11" %}} - and they they've been banding it around in in the halls of physics for a few years now at least that I know of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="319" display="5:19" %}} - everybody knows that in order to have everything that is you have to begin with something you have to so this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="328" display="5:28" %}} - another reason why for us Christians the burden of proof that God exists is never on us because everything demands that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="335" display="5:35" %}} - should exist it is either you have God or you have the universe and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="341" display="5:41" %}} - universe is manifestly not God because the universe experiences change it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="348" display="5:48" %}} - transforms and that requires that something is acting upon it that is how  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="355" display="5:55" %}} - change happens change is is is things that are are stable in nature do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="361" display="6:01" %}} - change and that is why God is the is the is that's another aspect of God being  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="367" display="6:07" %}} - the is it means he never changes nothing can act on him and transform him in any  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="373" display="6:13" %}} - way and nothing can compromise the quality of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="379" display="6:19" %}} - existence but God can act on everything he can Will things into existence that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="384" display="6:24" %}} - actually how he created you know everything that is and can I for a a um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="391" display="6:31" %}} - the point that we're making here is great um one of the other reasons why it just makes sense for us to speak of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="397" display="6:37" %}} - existence qu existence for us as humans is because we exist only within you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="403" display="6:43" %}} - four dimensions right space and matter and time we are bound by them and our  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="409" display="6:49" %}} - conception of existence is fundamentally linked to these properties which God is not bound by and so this is one reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="417" display="6:57" %}} - why it can be difficult for us to talk with atheists or even agnostic people about this is just we we aren't starting  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="424" display="7:04" %}} - from the same ideas of what existence even is because when they talk about something existing before time what does  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="431" display="7:11" %}} - existing before time even mean like we as humans have a very bad understanding  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="437" display="7:17" %}} - of this because we are limited by SpaceTime um another thing just bouncing off points you brought up um this comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="444" display="7:24" %}} - up in philosophy some of the arguments for God's existence I personally I've always been more like well God exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="450" display="7:30" %}} - because the Bible says he does and we trust the Bible and we take it on faith it's a presupposition but philosophers  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="455" display="7:35" %}} - do argue about this um there's one particular argument that goes something about the need for an uncaused cause  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="462" display="7:42" %}} - right the prime mover believe that's what Aristotle calls it um the uncaused cause it is logically necessary if  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="471" display="7:51" %}} - everything in the universe is this chain of cause and effect something has to set it off to begin with and like Audi said  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="476" display="7:56" %}} - it can't be the big bang because right now I don't want to be mean but my understanding of the physics is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="482" display="8:02" %}} - right now they say that before there was time and space and matter there was like a point charge of energy and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="487" display="8:07" %}} - fundamental problem with this is that the point charge of energy is still not nothing so um that's just me riffing on  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="494" display="8:14" %}} - all the things you brought up um very good points here yeah yeah so I I want to say finally  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="502" display="8:22" %}} - just to wrap up that the reason I've actually gone into this is not because I know that a lot of Christians really  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="508" display="8:28" %}} - generally don't want to deal with philosophy and all of that because they feel like it it goes against faith in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="514" display="8:34" %}} - some way um but that's not the point I'm not even interested in addressing that specifically the reason I'm raising it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="520" display="8:40" %}} - is this to show that there is a reason that the Bible says first the fool says  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="528" display="8:48" %}} - in his heart that there is no God second that everything that exists is Testament  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="534" display="8:54" %}} - it's a testament of God's existence that's Psalm 19: 1-6 and Revelation um sorry Romans  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="541" display="9:01" %}} - 1:20 the Bible States it as an incontrovertible fact that the bare  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="547" display="9:07" %}} - existence of of the universe as we see it is absolute incontrovertible proof of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="555" display="9:15" %}} - God's existence there is in other words you have to deny reality to deny God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="561" display="9:21" %}} - existence because however you skew It Whatever argument you make you either  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="568" display="9:28" %}} - end up with something that always has been and therefore brought everything else that exists about or you end up  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="576" display="9:36" %}} - where you assume that something that obviously cannot always have been is that which has always been so you can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="583" display="9:43" %}} - really get away from the core definition of what God is that which always is yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="590" display="9:50" %}} - you can't get away from it so you either accept that that definition belongs to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="595" display="9:55" %}} - the god that we find in the Bible or you ascribe it to the universe that you exist in or even ascribe it to yourself  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="601" display="10:01" %}} - if you're willing to go so far as to be a solipsist you will always ascribe that quality to something which means you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="608" display="10:08" %}} - cannot get away from deity in any philosophy that any human being has ever come up with so I will say there a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="616" display="10:16" %}} - branch of neoplatonic philosophers I wrote a paper on one of them in college there's this guy named platinus um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="622" display="10:22" %}} - so some of the neoplatonic folks they called for all intents and purposes what they called God we believe as is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="628" display="10:28" %}} - Christian God and they they they had a similar concept again these are pagans not believing in judeo-christian God but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="635" display="10:35" %}} - they had the same problems with existence and the uncaused cause and all of this they conceptualized something  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="642" display="10:42" %}} - and they didn't Define it the same but it's logically necessary is what we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="648" display="10:48" %}} - um and to tie this up perhaps a little bit this is why us grasping that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="655" display="10:55" %}} - existence God is being it is his nature is kind of a core fundamental part of us  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="662" display="11:02" %}} - understanding who God really is um so it's not minor maybe it seems kind of hard to wrap our heads around and it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="667" display="11:07" %}} - will be for us as finite human beings but it's important in Understanding God's kind of separateness from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="674" display="11:14" %}} - universe he transcends it in a way that we can't perfectly understand but it's really important for us to kind of get  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="681" display="11:21" %}} - that sense of how big God is and how separate he is from everything that has been created um he is the Creator and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="689" display="11:29" %}} - how can he possibly be bound by his own creation that's the idea here yeah yeah okay that's so I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="698" display="11:38" %}} - that's where we'll stop this point and we'll about to pick up with the second  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="706" display="11:46" %}} - one okay all right so the next point that we're going to be talking about is we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="712" display="11:52" %}} - are going to be talking about the idea of the resplendence of God and this is a manifestation of his essence of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="719" display="11:59" %}} - nature um and so uh the study on ikus here I know I pulled things out into  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="724" display="12:04" %}} - slides but this is coming directly from the study talks about light and Glory so loosely speaking light captures the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="731" display="12:11" %}} - sense that God is Sublime and unapproachable and so you might compare squinting at the Sun and being blinded  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="737" display="12:17" %}} - by it you can't really see it while Glory represents this the side that shines forth visibly to mankind so we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="744" display="12:24" %}} - see the glory the effects of God's of God's existence and his work working in the world glory is what we can see uh in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="752" display="12:32" %}} - the metaphor here light is sort of what we can't see the unapproachable of God um and so there's this verse here in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="759" display="12:39" %}} - Hebrews chapter 1 um the Bible is very clear that uh the way in which God has  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="765" display="12:45" %}} - manifested his glory most kind of visibly in the world is by speaking through his son so this is picking up  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="771" display="12:51" %}} - right at the beginning of Hebrews chapter 1 it says God after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="777" display="12:57" %}} - in many portions and in many many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son whom he appointed heir of all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="784" display="13:04" %}} - things through whom he also made the world so Jesus Christ is God's primary  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="790" display="13:10" %}} - message to humankind the primary manifestation of his glory um now we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="796" display="13:16" %}} - not going to get into verse three here uh interesting tangent perhaps but the idea is that Jesus Christ represents  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="803" display="13:23" %}} - God's glory most directly revealed to mankind um so before I kick us off and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="808" display="13:28" %}} - we start doing questions here um Lisa had brought up this quote here from 1  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="814" display="13:34" %}} - Timothy 6: 16 um and so I should probably actually go find that I think I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="819" display="13:39" %}} - have it pulled up over here um so 1 Timothy 6:16 and this is a quote from or  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="825" display="13:45" %}} - one of the verses that Dr duil uses in the ikas study um talking about the unapproachable light it says uh God who  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="833" display="13:53" %}} - alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no one has seen or can see to him be honor and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="839" display="13:59" %}} - eternal Dominion amen so the question here was what does it mean for God Alone  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="846" display="14:06" %}} - to have immortality given that both Angel and human will have kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="852" display="14:12" %}} - Eternal existence um so this is one of those places um where this is an English  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="858" display="14:18" %}} - problem it's not a problem in Greek so the Greek word here um you can see the Greek is up here for 1 Timothy  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="865" display="14:25" %}} - 6:16 um is this one right here see the begin with an alpha and then a Theta right so athanasia is the word here and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="873" display="14:33" %}} - it means more literally translated it means like not dying undying and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="881" display="14:41" %}} - way in which God is different from us is human beings experience death God being  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="886" display="14:46" %}} - separate from SpaceTime God does not die God is unchanging as we've just talked about because God is being God is life  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="894" display="14:54" %}} - that's one of the other things we'll get to and so this word isn't immortality in the sense of Eternal existence as it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - lack of dying if that makes sense that's kind of a separate concept so um I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - know if that question and that answer makes sense but that is one place where we could start  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="915" display="15:15" %}} - here okay yeah um I want to see that quote again God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="922" display="15:22" %}} - Alone possesses immortality okay so the first here in uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="927" display="15:27" %}} - 1 Timothy chapter 6 yeah yeah okay okay so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="934" display="15:34" %}} - uh I think I think uh you you you captured it quite well we don't possess  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="942" display="15:42" %}} - immortality we in the sense of owning it God owns it it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="948" display="15:48" %}} - his and he shared it with us um when we read Ecclesiastes he says that he has  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="954" display="15:54" %}} - set eternity in our hearts and then in another place few verses after that he before that it actually said that um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="962" display="16:02" %}} - everything that God does lasts forever which which kind of proves that he owns  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="968" display="16:08" %}} - immortality um there are those who might argue on the basis of this passage uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - First Timothy that this is why they believe that um unless God actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="981" display="16:21" %}} - gives you life you won't live forever so those who will not be with God in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="987" display="16:27" %}} - eternity will die and that's it they'll be gone from existence but that flies in the face of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - what Ecclesiastes says which is that everything that God makes lasts forever and that thing that very statement from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1002" display="16:42" %}} - Ecclesiastes actually explains what we are asking about how is he the only one  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1008" display="16:48" %}} - who possesses immortality it's because it's his he is that which is everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1015" display="16:55" %}} - else derives its aess from him MH so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1020" display="17:00" %}} - when he makes things and imbus them by the quality of just making them that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1026" display="17:06" %}} - just how God is the things he he he builds the things he makes are just like that they exist  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1032" display="17:12" %}} - Forever by D of the fact that he is the one who makes them they are Immortal in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1040" display="17:20" %}} - that sense that's one way to to appreciate the the question of who possesses immortality it's that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1046" display="17:26" %}} - possess it's his and uh he gives it to wh whomever he pleases now um can I cut  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1052" display="17:32" %}} - in with something here as well so I I kind of made the point that this word is getting at lack of death and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - kind of begs the question of well which kind of death if you are familiar with some of ichus teachings you'll know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1066" display="17:46" %}} - ichus generally speaks of three types of death so when the serpent tempts Eve in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1071" display="17:51" %}} - Genesis chapter 3 um the serpent says if you eat of the tree you will surely die  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1076" display="17:56" %}} - and that verse if you don't if you're not careful in your hermeneutics when you interpret it well you know eve took  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1083" display="18:03" %}} - a bite and she didn't immediately get struck by a bolt from heaven for example so that statement was true with regards  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1088" display="18:08" %}} - to physical death so there's kind of physical death and then there's spiritual death which we Define a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1094" display="18:14" %}} - separation from God and then there's what we call the second or Eternal death which is life in the Lake of Fire after  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1101" display="18:21" %}} - we die right and what a he was getting at is well when you die physically that is the destination for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1107" display="18:27" %}} - those who do not believe it is an eternal state of of existence and so you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1112" display="18:32" %}} - might also note that Jesus Christ died physically right but the death in view  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1118" display="18:38" %}} - here is more complicated than just physical death right that's not the only thing in view when we say that God is um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1124" display="18:44" %}} - you know described by this word athanasia right that God does not taste death well  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1130" display="18:50" %}} - God is life right Jesus Christ was never separated from the father in what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1135" display="18:55" %}} - would term a spiritual sense and of course any eternity he's not going to the lake of fire and so it's more than  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1141" display="19:01" %}} - just physical death that is in view here it's the whole shebang the whole Spectrum all three classifications of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1147" display="19:07" %}} - death because God is life fundamentally and he can't like uh what's the right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1153" display="19:13" %}} - word like uh reject himself right how could God die of God his life right it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1158" display="19:18" %}} - just a nonsensical concept yeah now the the reason that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1163" display="19:23" %}} - started from where I started is just to make sure that um we capture the the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1169" display="19:29" %}} - owning of immortality part the other side of things is what you're talking about where the Death part comes in but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1176" display="19:36" %}} - death was actually just like you said I think I want to put a fine point on it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1181" display="19:41" %}} - in this way that death is the it is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1187" display="19:47" %}} - description of our relationship to God in a particular state so physical death  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1194" display="19:54" %}} - was not supposed to be a thing that was not how things were supposed to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1199" display="19:59" %}} - although of course in God's plan he knew what would happen and had written it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1205" display="20:05" %}} - So Physical death the ending of experience in this physical  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1213" display="20:13" %}} - body was the consequence of going contrary to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1219" display="20:19" %}} - which of course is like well if you cease drinking from the Fountain of Life then obviously you start to die so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1229" display="20:29" %}} - when Adam and Eve's relationship with God was cut off the next thing that happened was we're not going to allow  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1235" display="20:35" %}} - them access to the Tree of Life which they if they continue to eat they will exist forever right that was a very um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1245" display="20:45" %}} - uh dramatic or graphic way of demonstrating what had happened spiritually which meant if they were no  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1253" display="20:53" %}} - longer taking their cue from God then they could no longer be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1259" display="20:59" %}} - living so in that sense that that deathlessness comes into play which also  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1267" display="21:07" %}} - derives its meaning from the fact that God owns immortality nothing else  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1272" display="21:12" %}} - possesses it except that he gives it to that thing and that's the point that because God created things they last  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1280" display="21:20" %}} - forever I I'll try to demonstrate first of all we know from the scriptures that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1286" display="21:26" %}} - even if you're an unbeliever you are going to be resurrected your Resurrection is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1292" display="21:32" %}} - going to be the same as the res the resurrection of a Believer but you're going to be resurrected in a body that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1298" display="21:38" %}} - is suited for Eternal condemnation there is no going out of existence forever for anybody because  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1305" display="21:45" %}} - nobody was designed to go out of existence we have also in second Peter  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1311" display="21:51" %}} - chapter 3 that everything we see the entire universe we see is going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1316" display="21:56" %}} - burned up and removed out of the way and yet we have cause to understand that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1324" display="22:04" %}} - that is not necessarily meaning that these things will cease to exist they  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1329" display="22:09" %}} - simply will not exist for the purpose for which they had originally been made  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1335" display="22:15" %}} - this is a a a universe that is Tainted with sin and for that reason it's going to be sort of rolled away removed from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1343" display="22:23" %}} - its place and replaced with something better and that's actually why we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - about the new universe as a resurrection of God's creation rather than rather than like he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1357" display="22:37" %}} - he deleted something entirely and put something else in its place in that sense so the what we're getting at is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1364" display="22:44" %}} - God owns immortality and by by D of the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1370" display="22:50" %}} - he does everything he creates is it it has it built into it in the sense that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1377" display="22:57" %}} - things possess the ability to exist forever not necessarily in the way that they God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - would have wanted them to but in the way that they have come to be used so um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1389" display="23:09" %}} - deathlessness side of things makes absolute sense too when we start to think of the relationship of things to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1395" display="23:15" %}} - God that means he owns immortality if you turn against him then how can you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1402" display="23:22" %}} - actually participate in his immortality in that sense you are cut off from his life in some way it does not mean that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1409" display="23:29" %}} - you will cease to exist forever the unbeliever will still be in the Lake of Fire forever he still exists he has some  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1416" display="23:36" %}} - form of immortality but he is cut off from the life that is God the fullness of life that is God the beauty of life  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1423" display="23:43" %}} - that is God everything because all the there is nothing about goodness or or or  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1429" display="23:49" %}} - life or beauty that is external to God you don't find those things outside of God it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1435" display="23:55" %}} - like uh when people say that um it's something that I believe Proverbs talks about that um stolen stolen bread is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1443" display="24:03" %}} - sweet stolen waters are sweet and the Bible says they end up as gravel in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1448" display="24:08" %}} - mouth that's true some people take pleasure in doing the wrong thing but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1454" display="24:14" %}} - yes that's a warping of our nature but in fact true pleasure is with God that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1462" display="24:22" %}} - where it is so when God removes all that is actually him from a particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1467" display="24:27" %}} - situation you have a husk of an existence there's immortality there but it isely immortality it's like yeah so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1477" display="24:37" %}} - that's where the deathlessness side of things comes from but the reason I started from where I started is to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1482" display="24:42" %}} - sure that we understand that what what Paul is saying to Timothy here is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1488" display="24:48" %}} - because God himself owns this thing that's why we are close to him he owns  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1496" display="24:56" %}} - it none of us can get it from anywhere else immortality is what God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1501" display="25:01" %}} - about that's his is to speak next thing probably I think we have covered this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1508" display="25:08" %}} - one pretty well although of course if anyone wants to ask more questions to clarify things that AI not have said  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1514" display="25:14" %}} - feel free um the next one that we were going to talk about was the idea of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1519" display="25:19" %}} - unapproachable light and so we said light represents the unapproachable sort of in the metaphor here and glory is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1526" display="25:26" %}} - visible form of the presence of God that takes place in the world and so the question is well  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1534" display="25:34" %}} - what about people like Moses on Mount Si the Mount of transfiguration Paul on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1540" display="25:40" %}} - road to Damascus John in his Visions did these people see God right um there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1546" display="25:46" %}} - another verse kind of appropo here um that talks about how no one can see God and live if you guys are recalling I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1554" display="25:54" %}} - don't remember exactly where that verse is I I know it's somewhere in the old test Testament um but well when Moses  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1560" display="26:00" %}} - was receiving the tablets of the law and he came back and his face was shining  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1565" display="26:05" %}} - and I think that comes up in like second Corinthians somewhere Paul talks about us being MIRS reflecting Glory from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1572" display="26:12" %}} - glory to glory uh it's a Greek idiom I don't want to get off topic but this idea of light and did these people  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1580" display="26:20" %}} - actually see God well if no one can see God and live well did they see God and uh if the light is truly unapproachable  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1586" display="26:26" %}} - did they approach the that sort of question um and I'll see what AI thinks but to me I think this comes straight  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1593" display="26:33" %}} - down to the idea of christophanies um so this idea theophany uh you know it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1601" display="26:41" %}} - technical jargon way of saying you know the god coming uh to Earth theophany is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1606" display="26:46" %}} - a seeing of of God and christophany is a seeing of Jesus Christ and so there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1612" display="26:52" %}} - the idea of the like definite article the angel of the Lord in the Old  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1618" display="26:58" %}} - Testament and that is actually a pre-incarnate Jesus Christ that is the second person of the Trinity the son the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1625" display="27:05" %}} - agent the one who created the universe um so if the father's the architect the son's the agent and the spirit is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1632" display="27:12" %}} - empowerer so to speak and we'll get to the Trinity and the roles they adopt a bit later in this study well these  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1638" display="27:18" %}} - instances of people seeing and interacting with God in the Old Testament were interactions with the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1646" display="27:26" %}} - christophanies um and the sort of veil of separation between the third heaven  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1652" display="27:32" %}} - and the universe which is presently tainted by sin uh is to keep the presence of the father distinctly  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1659" display="27:39" %}} - separate and there's some symbolism in The Temple of the holy of holies also separated by a curtain that's kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1665" display="27:45" %}} - the idea of God's holiness cannot be be in the presence of man without destroying the sin um so aie do you want  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1673" display="27:53" %}} - to Riff on anything I've said here about this question of what about these people who saw light or saw God but yet did not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1680" display="28:00" %}} - die you've you've really captured it I'm just going to unravel it a little bit more um so uh like you said it was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1688" display="28:08" %}} - christophany and uh it's important to remember I mean there are people who of course would argue that we we claim that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1694" display="28:14" %}} - Jesus Christ is God so what does that have to do with anything because we're still talking about seeing God and we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1702" display="28:22" %}} - know that where was that it was in John where where John said that they saw the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1709" display="28:29" %}} - god of Israel and ate and drank with him you know so it's like did they see did  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1715" display="28:35" %}} - they not see what which one is it and the Bible is this is where the the question of the Trinity begins to you  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1722" display="28:42" %}} - know creep up um exes holds and it is actually something I'm very persuaded is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1729" display="28:49" %}} - actually true true as well that um uh the father presents as the face of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - trinity in other words words he plays the role of the godhead the role of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1742" display="29:02" %}} - in the Trinity so Creation in in in the way they and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1749" display="29:09" %}} - roles of course overlaps overlap with each other the way that the the Trinity self assigned roles to themselves is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1757" display="29:17" %}} - that the father is actually the represent the representation of the deity of the Trinity to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1764" display="29:24" %}} - Creation so the TR the the father stays aloof from sinful creation does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1772" display="29:32" %}} - interact with sinful creation and maintains a barrier of separation from  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1778" display="29:38" %}} - sinful creation that's why we talk about God being in the third heaven and not being on Earth even though we know as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1786" display="29:46" %}} - will soon discuss that God is everywhere so if God is everywhere why do we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1792" display="29:52" %}} - he's in the third heaven it's because the the father himself who is the represent of the deity of the of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1800" display="30:00" %}} - Trinity is maintaining a perceptible separation from sinful  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - creation but the holy spirit is currently right here on Earth he's living in believers who are sinful he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1814" display="30:14" %}} - working in a world that is sinful he is restraining evil in a wicked world is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1820" display="30:20" %}} - that in any way violating anything the Bible says now I would I would make a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1826" display="30:26" %}} - point in and say whenever we see these things we don't think the way that a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1832" display="30:32" %}} - Believer should should go about it is not to think what is wrong here and rather to think what am I not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1839" display="30:39" %}} - understanding here so the holy spirit is in a sinful world the lord Jesus came  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1847" display="30:47" %}} - and he lived in the world died on the cross was raised from the dead and after  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1855" display="30:55" %}} - after he ascended into heaven heos is ended which meant his human nature and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1861" display="31:01" %}} - his divine nature were perfectly United in each other so when you consider all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1868" display="31:08" %}} - of that when you take all of that into consideration you we we come to understand that when the Bible says no  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1874" display="31:14" %}} - man may see my face and let that's in Exodus 33:20 by the way no man may see my face and and live you cannot see my  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1882" display="31:22" %}} - face for no man may see me and live that's how um the Lord said it what was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1888" display="31:28" %}} - being said is you are not permitted to see the representation of the deity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1894" display="31:34" %}} - the Trinity that's why the father is the face of the Trinity but then he told  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1899" display="31:39" %}} - Abraham he told Moses sorry um I will put you in a c and when I have passed by  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1904" display="31:44" %}} - and and place my hand on you so that you do not see my face but when I have passed by I will let I will let you see  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1910" display="31:50" %}} - my back right so that's that that one was interesting because in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1917" display="31:57" %}} - it would seem that the Lord Jesus would be this back so to speak because he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1923" display="32:03" %}} - the one who is facing creation remember that he was someone was walking in the Garden of Eden and the Bible said it was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1930" display="32:10" %}} - the Lord God with Adam and Eve and just as we have what as we have said the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1936" display="32:16" %}} - Bible records that they saw the god of Israel and ate and drank that's what the Bible actually records that this was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1942" display="32:22" %}} - referring to the 70 elders of Israel so all of these things tell that they saw somebody that was part of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1950" display="32:30" %}} - Trinity but there's someone they were not permitted to get in any contact with and that was the father we will see this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1957" display="32:37" %}} - playing out again when we talk about um the third heaven and uh Paradise when uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1964" display="32:44" %}} - Believers before the cross would die they couldn't go into the third heaven but they were in some place that was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1970" display="32:50" %}} - actually pleasurable that was delightful it was like a Garden of Eden of it Stone  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1976" display="32:56" %}} - it was Paradise Jesus called it paradise and he also called it Abraham's bosom it's the place from where Samuel  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1983" display="33:03" %}} - ascended when Saul um went to a a a uh a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1990" display="33:10" %}} - medium and asked to have him raised up to speak with him that's the same place  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="1995" display="33:15" %}} - that um Abraham was found it's the same place that uh Lazarus as the poor man  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2001" display="33:21" %}} - the poor believer was also found it's the same place that Jesus went to after he he died on the cross and the reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2009" display="33:29" %}} - for this this separation was because sinful man may not enter the presence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2015" display="33:35" %}} - the father even though they had communion with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit fell on many prophets even before Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2022" display="33:42" %}} - went to the cross and Jesus himself came and ate and drank and interacted with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2029" display="33:49" %}} - his disciples even though he was also God but the father nobody ever saw him  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2035" display="33:55" %}} - that's also the testimony of John no nobody ever saw him except the son that's what he said so when when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2042" display="34:02" %}} - think about these things that God dwells in unapproachable light and all of that we are supposed to understand the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2048" display="34:08" %}} - separation that exists between the father as a representation of the deity of the Trinity and sinful creation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2057" display="34:17" %}} - this is why we look forward to Resurrection that's why we look forward to the putting off of this body because  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2063" display="34:23" %}} - when we put off this body of sin there is no especially because Jesus has now died on the cross for us there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2069" display="34:29" %}} - longer any reason we cannot enter into the presence of the father so that's yeah I will say the the powerfulness of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2077" display="34:37" %}} - us not actually being able to commune with God in the third heaven is any believers who died until after the cross  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2084" display="34:44" %}} - it makes sense when you think of things in terms of justification um before the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2089" display="34:49" %}} - cross people were saved essentially on credit looking forward towards Christ sacrifice so all human beings from Adam  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2095" display="34:55" %}} - to the last person who who ever lived will be saved on account of their sin being paid for by Christ but the cross  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2102" display="35:02" %}} - is you know thousands of years into human history so what about all the people before the cross well they were  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2108" display="35:08" %}} - in this place that AI described but they could actually be in the presence of the father after Christ's Resurrection  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2115" display="35:15" %}} - because the resurrection represents God's acceptance of Christ's payment for our sins so after that point in a manner  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2121" display="35:21" %}} - of speaking God didn't see those people anymore he saw them through the blood of Jesus Christ and that's why they could  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2127" display="35:27" %}} - be in the presence of the father um because no longer was their sin tainting them because they'd been covered in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2134" display="35:34" %}} - blood of Christ now also of course uh in the new heavens and the new Earth the father will come and live among us so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2141" display="35:41" %}} - it's not just going to be um the son Among Us and the Holy Spirit indwelling us but we will be in the presence of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2147" display="35:47" %}} - father but that's only in the new heavens and the new earth once sin has be been completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2153" display="35:53" %}} - eradicated right so yeah um one other uh comment we had here on light and Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2159" display="35:59" %}} - um to go over was uh this one here about how the visible form of Christ's Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2165" display="36:05" %}} - was veiled in his first Advent to make the choice for him genuine um so the glory was revealed in his works and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2172" display="36:12" %}} - words some of the signs he did definitely manifesting the glory of the almighty um but by way of contrast when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2180" display="36:20" %}} - Jesus Christ comes again I believe it's in uh let me let me check myself on this whoops um I think it's in Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2187" display="36:27" %}} - chapter 19 um Revelation 19 is talking about the second coming of Christ um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2194" display="36:34" %}} - when he comes the second time uh let me see if I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2201" display="36:41" %}} - right am I right maybe I'm not yeah here he comes coming on a horse horse right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2207" display="36:47" %}} - um so when Jesus Christ comes again you know defeating the armies of the Antichrist and Armageddon um and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2213" display="36:53" %}} - judgment commences you know the the day of judgment so uh that Paradigm in scripture the day of the Lord Paradigm  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2220" display="37:00" %}} - if you're familiar with how Dr lugan Bill explains this in terms of Prophecy uh well on that day um then every knee  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2227" display="37:07" %}} - will bow and every tongue will confess that's a quote I believe it's from Timothy Thessalonians I can I can look  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2234" display="37:14" %}} - up the exact ver every KN every knee well that's that's in Philippians  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2239" display="37:19" %}} - chapter two Philippians yeah okay you're right Philippians 21-1 but that happens on the day of the Lord Paradigm um in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2246" display="37:26" %}} - ology this is the point in which yeah the veil comes off and we behold Christ's Glory as it is and at that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2253" display="37:33" %}} - point even unbelievers will not by their own will but because it is they can't deny it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2261" display="37:41" %}} - right you know God allows human Hardness of Heart to persist but they cannot deny the glory of God when he comes in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2267" display="37:47" %}} - manner um so they too will bow and their tongues will confess the glory of God because it will be manifest it will be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2275" display="37:55" %}} - something that you can't Harden your eyes to um and that will only happen at  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2280" display="38:00" %}} - that point in time um until now God lets Humanity persist in Hardness of Heart  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2286" display="38:06" %}} - but that will not be the case at that point in time yeah in in fact I I want to point  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2295" display="38:15" %}} - out that okay this is an an argument I used to make a few years ago I when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2301" display="38:21" %}} - people would say why doesn't God just show me himself why do a lot of atheists would argue  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2307" display="38:27" %}} - why does God need me why does God need you the Christian to argue for his existence so that I can believe why  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2314" display="38:34" %}} - doesn't he just show me himself so one very strong reason for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2319" display="38:39" %}} - this is actually that the same thing that we started with the isness of God the God is Ultimate Reality that is to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2329" display="38:49" %}} - say when you think about math for example math is um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2337" display="38:57" %}} - an a way to reason abstractly about the physical world  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2343" display="39:03" %}} - so you can talk all you want about x's and y's and calculus and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2349" display="39:09" %}} - whatnot it doesn't really mean it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't do much  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2354" display="39:14" %}} - until you actually start to bring those things to bear on physical systems that you interact with and that's the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2362" display="39:22" %}} - point math gives you a way of seeing those things mentally so that you can  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2368" display="39:28" %}} - act on them physically a lot of the things about life as we see them is similar to math  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2375" display="39:35" %}} - in that sense but God is the Ultimate Reality if anyone of us were to see God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2382" display="39:42" %}} - with his glory unveiled that is himself naked as as it can  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - get we would fail to be able to resist his will that's just how that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2396" display="39:56" %}} - it's like when the Sun rises and the Darkness recedes and all Shadows flee  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2404" display="40:04" %}} - that's exactly what happens when the glory of God is unveiled this is also  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2410" display="40:10" %}} - something I should have mentioned when I was talking about the unapproachable light issue that God veils himself in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2417" display="40:17" %}} - his interactions with with um with creation such that even even though the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2422" display="40:22" %}} - people of old were largely interacting with Jesus Christ himself he's Glory as deity was still veiled which is again to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2429" display="40:29" %}} - tell to remind us that it is the father who plays the role of the deity of the representation of the deity of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2435" display="40:35" %}} - Trinity the other two the the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit Veil their own Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2441" display="40:41" %}} - tremendously we have to understand that it's like with the father he is the one who does not Veil it in that sense so if  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2450" display="40:50" %}} - we were to walk into the presence of the father in sin we we would really die but  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2456" display="40:56" %}} - we can interact with the son we can interact with the holy spirit because they have given us it's like the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2462" display="41:02" %}} - Spirit actually living in a human being in in a Believer sorry okay so um it's like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2469" display="41:09" %}} - Holy Spirit actually living in a Believer and um in that same believer he  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2474" display="41:14" %}} - would be speaking and the believer can ignore what he is saying the miracle of that is sometimes beyond our ability to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2481" display="41:21" %}} - even perceive it's impossible to resist God  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2487" display="41:27" %}} - when God himself has decided that he will not be resisted can I can I read this verse from Isaiah 53 I just man  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2494" display="41:34" %}} - this hit me when you were talking here um this is talking now Isaiah 53 is the prophecy of the suffering servant which  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2500" display="41:40" %}} - we now know to be Jesus Christ but just listen to this for a second in terms of the veiled Majesty of God right so this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2507" display="41:47" %}} - is speaking of Jesus Christ as the suffering servant it says verse two he grew up before him like a tender shoot  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2513" display="41:53" %}} - and like a root out of dry ground he had no stately form or Majesty to attract us  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2518" display="41:58" %}} - no beauty that we should desire him he was despised and rejected by Men A Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief like  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2525" display="42:05" %}} - one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2531" display="42:11" %}} - not just just no stately former Majesty to attract this right this is why it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2536" display="42:16" %}} - always been about faith for us because we G it's not like Jesus Christ came and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2543" display="42:23" %}} - you know he was like a a Standing Tall among men you know with beauty outshining the rest and abilities So  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2552" display="42:32" %}} - Glorious that people had to fall down before him right um you get some of this in fiction when people are talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2558" display="42:38" %}} - the Majesty of Kings you know Emperors maybe I maybe it depends on culture a bit because you know in the Far East  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2564" display="42:44" %}} - some of them actually worship their Emperors as Gods but you know this idea of Regal Majesty that just people find  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2572" display="42:52" %}} - irresistible yeah Jesus when in during the Incarnation Jesus did not have that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2578" display="42:58" %}} - and so when you think about those that followed him and were willing to die for him they belied who he was in his kosis  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2586" display="43:06" %}} - um his Veil deity not because Jesus was so exceptional as a human being um yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2594" display="43:14" %}} - yeah so that's that's the thing the the the matter of of the glory of the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2602" display="43:22" %}} - and this is one thing that actually struck me in uh the way that EX presented that God is light so if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2609" display="43:29" %}} - were to actually speak of God in terms of substance that is what he is made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2614" display="43:34" %}} - of course that that we should remember that that's nonsensical language to speak there is no God is made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2619" display="43:39" %}} - anything but he would be light that would be the definition of him and think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2625" display="43:45" %}} - about this when Jesus returns the Bible speaks of him as rising like the sun and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - when we go to Zechariah 14 and it talks about how the moment of his of his is returned to the Earth will be it says at  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - that time will be neither day nor night the reason for this is that it's actually in the middle of the day when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2644" display="44:04" %}} - it should be light out it would be dark like it's midnight and then he rises and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2651" display="44:11" %}} - when he rises the Brilliance of his Rising is far brighter than anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2657" display="44:17" %}} - anyone has ever seen of the sun now think about Jesus Christ being the Morning Star too right exactly the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2665" display="44:25" %}} - Morning Star yes and this this is yeah this is the glory of his deity we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2672" display="44:32" %}} - the glory we're talking about is visibly resplendant its light beaming through  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2680" display="44:40" %}} - and this is actually what God is actually promising to every believer and it is the angels are already  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2686" display="44:46" %}} - experiencing it at the moment and departed Believers are experiencing it too he shares That Glory with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2692" display="44:52" %}} - us that we too will shine like Stars this is what Daniel says or the angel  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2697" display="44:57" %}} - told Daniel in Daniel chapter 12 that they will shine like stars in their father's Kingdom so we are to understand  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2705" display="45:05" %}} - that if we were to speak of God in terms of substance what he is made of again remembering that he is not made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2712" display="45:12" %}} - anything but the substance of his deity is light and glory is the is The Shining  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2718" display="45:18" %}} - forth of that light yeah and so that that is also to tell us how incredibly  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2724" display="45:24" %}} - amazing and and Powerful f it is that that light could walk among men and not be seen as light I mean how about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2731" display="45:31" %}} - about John chapter one right and yeah the light walked among the darkness and the Darkness did not recognize it right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2738" display="45:38" %}} - um yes exactly exactly yeah yeah so that's that's what I would say to to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2745" display="45:45" %}} - that yeah I just wanted to bring up the um the first U day of creation when  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2751" display="45:51" %}} - there was no sun but there was light y yeah in that case I would always be care  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2757" display="45:57" %}} - I would try to remind people that God God does not need to be the light himself he can create light without  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2762" display="46:02" %}} - actually you know um having his son shining it through and there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2768" display="46:08" %}} - difference between created light and the light that is actually God that's that's something we see creation but Lisa's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2775" display="46:15" %}} - Point's actually very interesting too uh not to get too far a few because we could get very off topic here but why was the universe dark right what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2782" display="46:22" %}} - talking about is one of the strongest inferential Arguments for or uh Genesis  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2787" display="46:27" %}} - being Recreation you know that teaching of the Gap theory on nius is because if God is a being of light as we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2794" display="46:34" %}} - it's a substance you know waving our hand at what that means precisely but if God is light then why was the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2802" display="46:42" %}} - dark it doesn't make sense unless the universe had been judged before um now I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2807" display="46:47" %}} - want to close this out I we've been on this man we have hit this one hard I am glad though this has been good stuff I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2813" display="46:53" %}} - want to read this passage here from or second second Corinthians chapter 3 so we are on this topic of light and glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2820" display="47:00" %}} - and specifically this idea of bailing and what it means for us as Believers too so this is talking about the New  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2826" display="47:06" %}} - Covenant picking up in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 7 so I'm just go ahead and read from verse 7 through Verse 18 I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2833" display="47:13" %}} - think it's all pretty relevant here as you guys will see and I think that's where we'll close this section so we can actually get through the third one in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2839" display="47:19" %}} - this video um but all very appropo to our discussion of Glory here so 2  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2846" display="47:26" %}} - Corinthians chapter 3 picking up at verse 7 says now if the ministry that brought death which was engraved in  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2852" display="47:32" %}} - letters on Stone came with Glory so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2858" display="47:38" %}} - Glory transitory though it was will not the ministry of the spirit be even more  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2863" display="47:43" %}} - glorious if the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious how much more glorious is the ministry that brings  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2869" display="47:49" %}} - righteousness for what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with The surpassing Glory and if what was  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2876" display="47:56" %}} - transitory came with Glory how much greater is the glory of that which lasts  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2881" display="48:01" %}} - therefore since we have such a hope we are very bold we are not like Moses who would put a veil over his face to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2888" display="48:08" %}} - prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away but their minds were made dull for to this day the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2895" display="48:15" %}} - same Veil remains when the old Covenant is read it has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away even to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2902" display="48:22" %}} - this day when Moses is read a veil covers their heart s but whenever anyone turns to the Lord the veil is taken away  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2910" display="48:30" %}} - now the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom and we all who with unveiled faces  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2917" display="48:37" %}} - contemplate the Lord's Glory are being transformed into his image with ever increasing Glory which comes from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2923" display="48:43" %}} - Lord who is the spirit amen right um so we are being transformed to reflect  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2930" display="48:50" %}} - God's glory we are reflectors of God's glory right through the indwelling ministry of the Holy Spirit now I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2937" display="48:57" %}} - there is one more thing so we're going to pause for a second and see if there's one more thing to talk about and then we'll finish off this section here all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2944" display="49:04" %}} - right well I think we decided that actually we talked a good bit about this topic so with this we're going to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2951" display="49:11" %}} - ahead and move on to the next thing here talking about the essence and nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2959" display="49:19" %}} - God all right so when we talk about some of these terms like Essence and nature  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2965" display="49:25" %}} - and character and if you've ever read any philosophy you might have also come across form and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2970" display="49:30" %}} - substance um well what are these things what's the difference between them and do we need to care about the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2977" display="49:37" %}} - throughout history many philosophers and theologians who dabble in philosophy like Thomas aquinus is a famous one they  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2984" display="49:44" %}} - argue about these things also comes up a lot in uh Catholic and Orthodox theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2989" display="49:49" %}} - where they talk about uh the son being eternally begotten of the father in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="2995" display="49:55" %}} - Spirit eternally proceeding from the father and all of these other things that they talk about in terms of ontology I don't really want us to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3002" display="50:02" %}} - there because I feel like we get a bit off topic but um we're just going to talk a little bit about what does it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3008" display="50:08" %}} - mean for something to be essential you know what is an essential characteristic of something um and so when you ask the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3015" display="50:15" %}} - question about well what's the difference between nature and Essence right uh debate that people have had for  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3020" display="50:20" %}} - a long time or substance or form or these other things arguments usually seem to hinge on how quote unquote  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3027" display="50:27" %}} - inherent something is to an object so for example a triangle must have three sides otherwise it's no longer a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3033" display="50:33" %}} - triangle so things that are essential and here this kind of blew my mind when I saw it if you compare the word essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3040" display="50:40" %}} - to essential right essential things are things that you have to have that compose the essence of something right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3046" display="50:46" %}} - they have the same root coming from that Greek word here and so essential things  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3052" display="50:52" %}} - are things without which an object is not whatever we are saying so if you want to use a fany jargony word that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3058" display="50:58" %}} - would be ontologically speaking right in terms of Something's existence if it does not have the essential properties  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3064" display="51:04" %}} - the essential characteristics it is not the thing that we are talking about so there's this blink here um I certainly  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3071" display="51:11" %}} - don't know very much about this website I was just coming up with an example and I thought this page did a decent job um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3076" display="51:16" %}} - you know this guy saying he's not a philosopher Etc um but he's using the example of circles right so if you draw  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3083" display="51:23" %}} - a circle over here like this one if you draw one on the other side of a page still a circle right location is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3090" display="51:30" %}} - we're going to call an accidental trait of a circle right it's not something that where if you change the location  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3096" display="51:36" %}} - something ceases to become a circle now if you draw one that's blue right color is also not an essential trait of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3102" display="51:42" %}} - circle because you can have circles that are different colors and they're all still circles right um so circles can have a lot of different accidental  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3108" display="51:48" %}} - traits but if you take this object right here this is not a circle right a circle  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3115" display="51:55" %}} - with four Four Corners can you have a circle with Corners no now you don't have a circle anymore you have a square  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3120" display="52:00" %}} - because round is an essential trait of a circle so I don't want to overly belabor the point I don't want to stick it off  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3126" display="52:06" %}} - in the weeds of philosophy but we're just talking a little bit about well what does it mean for something to have essential characteristics what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3133" display="52:13" %}} - Essence that sort of thing now where this kind of comes more on topic for us is when people argue about is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3141" display="52:21" %}} - infinity and his perfect character are these essential characteristics of God that is God not be God if he didn't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3148" display="52:28" %}} - these characteristics now I'm mostly introducing this because people argue about this my opinion is that wandering  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3155" display="52:35" %}} - too far in this direction rapidly leads one to something called theosophy which is usually kind of a pejorative way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3161" display="52:41" %}} - saying you're off in the philosophical Weeds about something in theology when you should just accept what the Bible says and move on right so God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3169" display="52:49" %}} - infinite and god is perfect in character so why are we arguing about this stuff right does it matter what does it mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3176" display="52:56" %}} - if this is an essential characteristic of God or not right I think a lot of the times people get off in the Weeds about this and it doesn't do much productive  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3183" display="53:03" %}} - that's my n equals one opinion here now if someone in this were to wh that I'm kind of question dodging and I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3188" display="53:08" %}} - defining my terms I'm just using things I would say that God's nature deals with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3193" display="53:13" %}} - his infinite abilities and God's character deals with his moral perfection and both are fundamental  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3199" display="53:19" %}} - parts of who he is as God um I don't know if that would uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3205" display="53:25" %}} - you know if that would satisfy all potential critics and I'm quite frankly not all that interested in satisfying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3211" display="53:31" %}} - potential critics here we are talking about who God really is not whether it conforms to a specific philosophical  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3218" display="53:38" %}} - framework or you know a definition of terms as this philosopher this  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - philosopher say Plato or Kant or whoever else uses these terms we're interested about who God really is and that is kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3229" display="53:49" %}} - of what's governing in our conversation here so um I'm sorry that's maybe a little bit unsatisfying I'm more raising  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3235" display="53:55" %}} - this to say we're not going to go too far into some of the philosophical weeds  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3241" display="54:01" %}} - here we're going to keep it at the surface level about who God really is what his abilities are what that says  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3246" display="54:06" %}} - about his nature and his moral perfection in his character um so nature his infinite nature and his perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3252" display="54:12" %}} - character those are the uh the next lessons that we're actually going to do um but I'm just kind of opening up that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3258" display="54:18" %}} - that's what we care about when we talk about the essence of God we don't have to twist ourselves into pretzels trying  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3264" display="54:24" %}} - to satisfy secular philosophers because what we're interested in is who God is not necessarily the philosophical  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3271" display="54:31" %}} - specifics and the technical terms and well how does this interact with Plato's conception of the forms or whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3276" display="54:36" %}} - right we don't need to go there because it's not really useful for enhancing our understanding of God does that make  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3282" display="54:42" %}} - sense a do you have more to say here yeah I'll just say that um one problem  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3288" display="54:48" %}} - with people like aquinus and all the others was was that they were doing philosophy they weren't you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3295" display="54:55" %}} - particularly engaging in Bible study they were trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3300" display="55:00" %}} - understand the scriptures they were trying to philosophize about God that's a different thing Al  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3306" display="55:06" %}} - together there is very much because the human mind is naturally arrogant um  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3312" display="55:12" %}} - there's always so much we think we can we can we can break God we can figure him out and all of that but what we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3319" display="55:19" %}} - here is Bible study we're trying to to you know um understand what the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3326" display="55:26" %}} - says about God so we will be seeking to understand what the Bible says about  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3332" display="55:32" %}} - God's Essence and as far as that goes we're not talking about essential characteristics we're talking about what  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3341" display="55:41" %}} - God is and that is this we've already talked about a big part of that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3347" display="55:47" %}} - what God is at his core what and here's the thing I I often like to use the term  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3353" display="55:53" %}} - deity to to make sure that everyone understands that I'm not talking about the identity of the person that has that  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3361" display="56:01" %}} - quality of deity I'm talking about the quality itself so what makes deity deity is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3369" display="56:09" %}} - we're talking about on the one hand which we have already talked about it's the fact that deity is the is it it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3376" display="56:16" %}} - never began to exist it will never cease to exist now that very word that very I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3384" display="56:24" %}} - will be what I am I am what I am I I am what I will be all of these things they  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3392" display="56:32" %}} - refer to the to the both the independent existence that is the self-existence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3398" display="56:38" %}} - that which possesses deity and also speaks to a lot of there there are implications that is what I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3404" display="56:44" %}} - mean there are there are implications of this self-existence if something self exists

{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3417" display="56:57" %}} - what we are going to discuss and we're not talking about it from a philos philosophical standpoint what we're saying um is this what it is is must it  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3426" display="57:06" %}} - be so couldn't it be no what we're talking about is what the scriptures actually say about be that's it I agree  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3433" display="57:13" %}} - and I will say that as an occupational hazard I have read a fair bit of philosophy I was a Classics major I  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - enjoyed it for my part kept in its proper place but I have bumped into problems time starting to question  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3446" display="57:26" %}} - things about the mechanics of something or trying to fit it in a framework where I've pestered Dr lugan with questions  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3453" display="57:33" %}} - and eventually he more or less tells me okay this thing that you're trying to do you're starting with this framework over  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3461" display="57:41" %}} - here rather than starting with the Bible I mean he says it way nicer than that but more or less our responsibility as  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3467" display="57:47" %}} - Christians as Believers is we need to start with the Bible we need to strive to understand and interpret the Bible we  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3473" display="57:53" %}} - don't start with a phrase fror and then try to like fit the Bible into that right like that's going about it backwards right um this Probably sounds  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3481" display="58:01" %}} - like well okay Stephen of course but it's actually a lot easier than you think to kind of fall into a pattern of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3487" display="58:07" %}} - thought where you get hung up on things that you would never get from the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3493" display="58:13" %}} - if you just read the Bible try to understand the Bible make sense of the Bible it's because you're starting  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3498" display="58:18" %}} - somewhere else right and that's when you get off in the Weeds about things and so I just wanted to emphasize this point up  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3504" display="58:24" %}} - front that what we are talking about in all of this is who God is who the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3509" display="58:29" %}} - says God is right and what that means and his his characteristics his abilities um speaking as deity right  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3516" display="58:36" %}} - that's as Audi said rather than getting caught up in all of these pointless debates where we're not even really  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3522" display="58:42" %}} - arguing about what the Bible says anymore now we're just I don't even know what we're talking about right um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3527" display="58:47" %}} - yeah we're not going to do that and according to some people that will mean that we didn't quote unquote do a thorough job or whatever but whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3534" display="58:54" %}} - because we're starting with the Bible we're going to stick with the Bible and we're going to talk about what the Bible has to say in terms of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3540" display="59:00" %}} - characteristics um both in his infinity and his moral perfection and that is all  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3545" display="59:05" %}} - we're going to talk about because that's all that should matter to us  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3551" display="59:11" %}} - um all right so that brings to a close this first uh lesson that we've done  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3557" display="59:17" %}} - here so we started out talking about how God is being he is The Great I Am uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3563" display="59:23" %}} - one who is or sorry who was and is and is to come the almighty right God is separate God is existence and we talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3571" display="59:31" %}} - about some of the implications of that for what it means to be a self-existing being um right God is the uncaused cause  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3578" display="59:38" %}} - that comes up in these things that philosoph Phil philosophers argue about but from our perspective what we care  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3584" display="59:44" %}} - about is that this is who God tells us he is God exists independent from the universe has always existed and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3591" display="59:51" %}} - existence is not in any way conditional upon creation and then we talked some uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3596" display="59:56" %}} - a good bit actually about light and Glory light as the idea of God being  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3601" display="1:00:01" %}} - unapproachable AI articulated uh that the father is the face the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3607" display="1:00:07" %}} - representational deity if you will in the Trinity and we talked some about christophanies in the Old Testament and  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3613" display="1:00:13" %}} - how these things interact with the veiled glory of God and how there will come a time on that uh that great day of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3620" display="1:00:20" %}} - days so the day of the Lord Paradigm in interpretation when that will be removed  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3625" display="1:00:25" %}} - and every knee will bow and every tongue will confess so talking about light and Glory as manifestations of God's uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3632" display="1:00:32" %}} - Essence his identity his deity and then finally we closed here kind of talking a little bit about how we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3638" display="1:00:38" %}} - focusing our approach on scripture what the Bible says and so there are some terms thrown about here in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3645" display="1:00:45" %}} - ontology uh that kind of get off in the weeds of philosophy um and so we are going to try to concern ourselves with  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3652" display="1:00:52" %}} - what the Bible says and how the Bible Des describes God in terms of his characteristics and his Essence and only  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3659" display="1:00:59" %}} - concern oursel with that and so this was how we kind of introduced oursel uh easing into this study here in Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3666" display="1:01:06" %}} - basics part one uh the study of God and in coming lessons we will be talking about God's infinite nature and also  
{{% timestamp videoId="otO3Nt6Xu9I" time="3674" display="1:01:14" %}} - God's moral perfection uh God's perfect character so those are the things that we will pick up with next

#### Introduction: God's infinite nature {#god-s-infinite-nature-introduction-god-s-infinite-nature}

Key point: God's nature is infinite. *Infinite*.

God's infinity – infinity in every way and according to any conceivable true standard – is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His abilities*.

Were prophets actually transported into the future (i.e., plucked from one point in the "river of time" and dropped at another as an observer), or did they just have visions of the future (i.e., see visions of it like a movie)?

{{< subjects >}}

God's being transcends space. He is not limited or bounded by spatial issues or concerns. God is not subject to space in any way. God is not confined by space – God created space and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Unique {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-unique}

<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-de-facto-ruler-of-the-universe">God > Is *de facto* ruler of the universe</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Uniqueness comes from God's infinite nature. No one else in the universe can reasonably be compared to Him. He is absolutely unique within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His spirituality, eternity and immeasurability. From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence.

| Essential Quality                               | Manifesting in creation as                                                                                            |

| Being spiritual (rather than bound by matter)   | Omnipotence (God may affect material creation however he pleases)                                                     |
| Being eternal (rather than bound by time)       | Omniscience (God knows everything in creation from beginning to end, and even what could have been)                   |
| Being immeasurable (rather than bound by space) | Omnipresence (God is ever-present in creation: as far as the East is from the West, nothing can separate us from God) |

While we may not be properly able to fully grasp God's true nature since we are small, finite beings bound by spacetime, it should nonetheless be clearly apparent that it is not possible for any created creature to compare with the Creator. Even creatures far more powerful than ourselves---Satan and the other angels---are bound and limited in ways God is not, leaving God completely alone and unique in His transcendence of and supremacy within the physical universe.

#### God is Omnipotent {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omnipotent}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omnipotent">God > Is omnipotent</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is all-powerful, irrespective of matter. He can effect anything He desires in the material realm, and nothing can transpire apart from His will. Therefore there is no deed (nor was there ever, nor will there ever be) which God is unable to do, small or great.

##### "Could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" {#god-s-infinite-nature-could-god-create-a-rock-so-big-even-he-couldn-t-lift-it}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#apologetics">Apologetics</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

You may have come across something like "So, could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" This is (supposedly) pitting two aspects of omnipotence against each other: God's ability to create anything He wishes *ex nihilo*, and God's strength.

People argue that the two superlatives mandated by omnipotence contradict each other. Supposedly, if God cannot create an object too heavy for Him to lift, he is not omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to create anything. And likewise, if there would exist some object that God could create but was unable to lift, then He also would not be omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to lift everything. "See!", they say, "either way, He cannot do something; therefore, He is not omnipotent!"

We can let people who wish to not believe on account such an argument go on their merry way. We needn't take them up on the debate. For it is *obvious* that God can both create whatsoever He wishes, and also manipulate His creation in whatever ways He wishes. The idea of a material object He cannot create is definitionally impossible, and so too a material object He cannot manipulate. Put differently, there is no such thing as an object He could create but not lift, or an object He could lift but not create. So the entire objection is circular by assuming such a thing can exist to begin with. That is, they've already put God in a box from the very beginning, and then only proceed to smugly knock down nothing but a straw man.

<!-- --- -->

My counsel would be to avoid all such nonsense. God can do "it", whatever "it" may be. Always. We follow אֵל שַׁדַּי, *El Shaddai*, God Almighty, He who was, and is, and is to come---He who holds the strings of the universe in His hands, and can create or annihilate galaxies in the blink of an eye. And we'd better fear that power and majesty as we ought, to keep our lives in perspective. We are tiny compared to the vastness of the Earth, much less our solar system, much less our galaxy, much less the universe. But God is even bigger (infinitely bigger), and could snuff them all out in the blink of an eye if He decided to. *That* is the kind of power in view when we speak of God being omnipotent. Not that He will actually snuff out the universe on a whim, but that it would be nothing for Him to do so, since He is in complete control of matter, time, and space... and things only exist because *He* causes them to exist.

#### God is Omniscient {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omniscient}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omniscient">God > Is omniscient</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is all-knowing, irrespective of time. He can effect anything He desires in the temporal realm. Therefore God knows (has always known, and always will know) everything, the end from the beginning. As the Everlasting One (Ps.90:2; 90:4), His knowledge of every event that ever has or will or even could occur within His creation is comprehensive and absolute.

<!-- --- -->

##### God's knowledge of hypotheticals {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-s-knowledge-of-hypotheticals}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#omniscience-includes-knowledge-of-hypotheticals">Omniscience > includes knowledge of hypotheticals</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#molinism">Molinism</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#middle-knowledge">Middle knowledge</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

The "could occur" bit is important. God's knowledge of all possible hypotheticals is sometimes discussed in terms of so-called ["Molinism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism) and "middle knowledge". I prefer to discuss it independent from all the baggage there, however.

Here's an example: since the Bible says that God will never test us past what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), then that implies He knows what we would and would not be able to bear. He wouldn't be able to perfectly test us to refine our faith unless He knew all information like this.

Same deal with perfectly disciplining us, and plenty of other matters besides. Put simply, God's perfect foreordination of all things logically requires that He know everything about all potential paths in the mind-bogglingly complex decision tree that spans the history of the entire universe. It has always puzzled me why people would ever think to argue against such a notion, but alas, some people do for some reason. Perhaps it is because such a belief requires one to appreciate how truly "big" and unlike us (with our very finite perspective) God really is?

<!-- --- -->

For now, you should mostly ignore the fact that some people have again put God in a box in their minds, and content yourself with the sure confidence that God knows everything---absolutely everything, inclusive of our free-will decisions before we even make them---and is so infinitely wise as to have perfectly mapped out all of creature history before the universe was even created. There is a Perfect Divine Plan being worked out around us, and God knows very well what He is doing, rest assured.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Omnipresent {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omnipresent}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omnipresent">God > Is omnipresent</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is ever-present, irrespective of space. He can effect anything He desires in the spatial realm (Job 26:7). Therefore God has the ability (has always had, and always will have) to be anywhere and everywhere, local and universal.

Of particular note is that this means God sees all. Nobody can sneak anything past God, and on that Great Day of Days, all will be revealed. It also means it is completely futile to try to run away from God. Like Jonah, we will find that no matter where we go, God and His purposes for us will always be there too.

### Video/audio transcript {#god-s-infinite-nature-video-audio-transcript}

{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right guys so this week we are picking up and we are going to be talking about God's infinite nature so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="6" display="0:06" %}} - last time we met we were talking about the essence of God in general uh so I don't have the slides up but we did talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="13" display="0:13" %}} - about how God is The Great I Am God is being uh we talked about uh light and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="19" display="0:19" %}} - Glory as manifestations of God's resplendant and we also talked about kind of the difference between nature  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="26" display="0:26" %}} - and Essence and uh kind of waved our hands a bit and said you know what but we for the purposes of this study are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="32" display="0:32" %}} - just going to be explaining who God is from the Bible and we're going to not worry so much about some of the technical terms and the arguments that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="39" display="0:39" %}} - philosophers have about these things we're just going to talk about God in terms of how the Bible explains him to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="45" display="0:45" %}} - us and so picking up on that line this week we're going to be starting out talking about God's infinite nature um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="52" display="0:52" %}} - So within the study of IUS we have God's infinite nature and God's perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="57" display="0:57" %}} - character are kind of the subheadings that we're going to be going through uh next in our sequence here and this week  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="62" display="1:02" %}} - is God's infinite nature so here are the sub points that we're going to be going through we're going to start out just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="68" display="1:08" %}} - the general introduction that he's infinite and what that means for us going to talk about how God is spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="74" display="1:14" %}} - Eternal and immeasurable in a spatial sense and then we're going to talk about how these things uh essential attributes  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - of God make God unique um and he's also unique because of how they manifest in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="86" display="1:26" %}} - creation and so that's where the omnipotence the omniscience and the omnipresent comes from and so that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="91" display="1:31" %}} - general structure of what we're going to go through here today and um as we go um this middle section here about how God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="98" display="1:38" %}} - is unique this is the transition between these first three which are the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="104" display="1:44" %}} - so-called essential qualities of God um this is uh uh you know God independent  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="109" display="1:49" %}} - from creation if you will and then the latter three are how these qualities manifest in how God relates to creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="116" display="1:56" %}} - and so that's kind of what the middle section there uh is is going  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="123" display="2:03" %}} - through all right so that first point for us to make is simply this that God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="129" display="2:09" %}} - nature is infinite and this is actually a decidedly difficult concept for us as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="134" display="2:14" %}} - humans to understand because we as humans are not infinite now God's Infinity which is infinity in every way  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="141" display="2:21" %}} - and according to any conceivable true standard so it's not like God's just really big he's not a super creature  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="148" display="2:28" %}} - he's not you know something that we can honestly contextualize we don't have a reference for a being that is truly  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="155" display="2:35" %}} - infinite but God's Infinity for us uh is a clarifying Concept in that it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="160" display="2:40" %}} - illuminates his abilities so uh when we talk about God's character which is what we'll come next in the study we'll talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="166" display="2:46" %}} - about how God's perfect character illuminates his motives um the reasons behind how he operates in creation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="173" display="2:53" %}} - God's Infinity illuminates his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="178" display="2:58" %}} - abilities so the first thing that we're going to be talking about is about how God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="184" display="3:04" %}} - spiritual and so in being spiritual God's being transcends the physical Universe he's not limited or bounded by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="192" display="3:12" %}} - material concerns or issues God is Not subject to matter in any way he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="197" display="3:17" %}} - made of matter because God created matter and employs it however he desires  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="202" display="3:22" %}} - and so this is the first of these essential qualities that we're talking about so uh spiritual Eternal and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="208" display="3:28" %}} - immeasurable those are the three we're going through first and this one is talking specifically about matter and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="214" display="3:34" %}} - when we say matter we're talking about the things that are created in the material universe so the world and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="220" display="3:40" %}} - everything in it uh the second and third Heavens if you will that's how the Bible describes them so uh you know our solar  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="226" display="3:46" %}} - system the galaxies everything in the universe that has substance is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="231" display="3:51" %}} - we're getting at here and when we say that God is spiritual God is separate from that he is separate from that which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="238" display="3:58" %}} - has been created um the stuff if you will in the universe because he is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="243" display="4:03" %}} - completely spiritual being now one thing that I thought maybe it would be good for us to talk about just a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="250" display="4:10" %}} - is how God being spiritual is different than Angels being spiritual and so aie  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="256" display="4:16" %}} - um I know that's a little bit jumping ahead in the Systematic Theology uh Dr L has an entire section of the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="261" display="4:21" %}} - dedicated to Angels but do you have anything you want to say on regards to God's spirituality versus uh Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="268" display="4:28" %}} - which aren't quite the same as us and how they relate to SpaceTime yeah I do um I want to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="276" display="4:36" %}} - first of all that uh if anything is created it's made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="283" display="4:43" %}} - stuff and the Lord is not created so he's not made of stuff so when we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="290" display="4:50" %}} - in terms of spirit we might be feeling like this is other than material and there is some  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="297" display="4:57" %}} - sense to that but it is not strictly correct MH because everything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="304" display="5:04" %}} - exists is made of stuff so it is all really material in a sense of speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="311" display="5:11" %}} - and that's actually why we're not looking forward to a smokey hazy sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="318" display="5:18" %}} - heaven or oops well we'll see if he comes back in a sec yeah it's it's smok  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="324" display="5:24" %}} - sort of heaven or the new universe a place where you know things are not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="330" display="5:30" %}} - Material that's not the idea we we saw that um Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="335" display="5:35" %}} - could take in food even though the Lord could as well you know when he um came  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="342" display="5:42" %}} - to visit with Abraham with the angels we saw that they could interact with matter and um physical matter and uh they could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="351" display="5:51" %}} - eat food and they could have all of these experiences we have Genesis 6 that talks about um The Rebel Angels um creat  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="359" display="5:59" %}} - the Nephilim with human women and all of that so that suggests to us that they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="365" display="6:05" %}} - made of a different sort of material than the rest of the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="371" display="6:11" %}} - is but it is still material that's the idea but the Lord when we say that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="377" display="6:17" %}} - Lord is spiritual we're necessarily saying that he is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="382" display="6:22" %}} - Material so the his spirituality is essentially in contrast to the Universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="390" display="6:30" %}} - the spirituality of the Angels is not in contrast to the universe it's in contrast to other material things other  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="397" display="6:37" %}} - physical things and um the way that the Bible presents it it keeps using the word that is also translatable as wind  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="406" display="6:46" %}} - we find that kind of issue with different um modern translations instead  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="411" display="6:51" %}} - of saying Spirit they would say wind and in some places instead of seeing not just modern translations I think even the KJV have that issue so in some  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="418" display="6:58" %}} - places you will see spirit in some places you would see wind because the word is not really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="424" display="7:04" %}} - distinguishable from each other the idea here is that just as wind does have an  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="429" display="7:09" %}} - effect on matter around it and yet you can't see it you can't really touch it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="435" display="7:15" %}} - it's not tangible that's how these creatures are so the spirituality of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="441" display="7:21" %}} - angels is in contrast to the other material Creations in the universe in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="446" display="7:26" %}} - fact um this is one way to look at it that unless man had been created angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="453" display="7:33" %}} - would have been the only thing of their kind in the entire universe every other thing had either Flesh and Bones if they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="460" display="7:40" %}} - were animals or they had a physicality to them that the Angels did not have it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="466" display="7:46" %}} - classed them separately from everything that existed so when Man was created note what the Bible says that he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="472" display="7:52" %}} - made a little lower than the Angels that's actually speaking to the fact that man was more like all creatures of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="478" display="7:58" %}} - the Earth that he was like the Angels so the spirituality of the Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="485" display="8:05" %}} - was essentially to set them apart from everything else that God had made and spirituality of God is to contrast God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="492" display="8:12" %}} - as a thing with the universe as a and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="498" display="8:18" %}} - was the essential point that we're trying to draw a contrast between here and I think you did a good job explaining it that God's spirituality is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="505" display="8:25" %}} - completely distinct from anything that's created so humans are creatures angels are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="511" display="8:31" %}} - creatures both have been created by the Creator who is external to that which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="517" display="8:37" %}} - created um and maybe that sounds really technical but I think ai's done a good job explaining uh some of the points  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="523" display="8:43" %}} - just a couple other things to bring up in regards to this um Angels this physicality aspect is one of the reasons  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="530" display="8:50" %}} - why Genesis 6 was a thing it's one of the reasons why Angels um inhabit some  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="536" display="8:56" %}} - of the creatures in the gospels you know like going into the pigs um it uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="541" display="9:01" %}} - know that that word actually gets transliterated a lot of different ways but the gines or the gines um uh at that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="549" display="9:09" %}} - particular instance is angels have this desire for physicality um Dr lugan Bill  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="554" display="9:14" %}} - um uh discusses this in various parts of his studies and the other point that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="559" display="9:19" %}} - wanted to bring up in regards to this is that before humans were even created in the universe uh the universe had been  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="566" display="9:26" %}} - created and was inhabited by angels and so this is the the sons of God as they're called I believe it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="573" display="9:33" %}} - in job somewhere you know talks about how the sons of God Sayang during creation right a angels have this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="580" display="9:40" %}} - materiality to them even though they are different than us but God is completely separate all right so with that I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="586" display="9:46" %}} - we're gonna take a question here and we'll pick back up in a second all right so a good question that we just got was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="592" display="9:52" %}} - well if angels are already kind of of this different state than us why are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="598" display="9:58" %}} - they kind of uh uh looking down so to speak and if humans were created a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="603" display="10:03" %}} - little lower than the Angels um aie was quoting that passage then why do angels want that um this physical experience um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="612" display="10:12" %}} - and I I think my answer just to start us off and like I said I'll certainly let others jump in is just that uh Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="619" display="10:19" %}} - want things they don't have and so if angels don't have this the sensory  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="624" display="10:24" %}} - experience the actual physicality now um I should note that it's a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="630" display="10:30" %}} - dangerous for us to get too off in the Weeds about saying well Angels did this for this and that reason you know the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="635" display="10:35" %}} - Bible doesn't talk so explicitly about some of this um Dr lell has done a good job on this explaining um hypotheses for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="643" display="10:43" %}} - the motivations here um so for example uh before the universe was uh destroyed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="649" display="10:49" %}} - and remade um he hypothesizes certain things about angels kind of messing with the genetic code of the creatures the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="657" display="10:57" %}} - the fauna on the pre reconstruction Earth um as well as um Angels Desiring  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="663" display="11:03" %}} - the bodies of of you know things generally speaking as it shows up in the gospels and uh my initial answer would  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="670" display="11:10" %}} - just be because it's something that they lack and sort of Grass Is Always Greener sentiment is because of that that's why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="677" display="11:17" %}} - even though uh you know having this this Mortal coil to use that phrasing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="683" display="11:23" %}} - the KJV does makes us weaker and less powerful we still have that sensory EXP  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="689" display="11:29" %}} - ER and that's something that the Angels wanted to experience themselves iose aie  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="694" display="11:34" %}} - do you have thoughts to on top of that I think you really actually said what the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="700" display="11:40" %}} - issue is every time we're tempted the idea is that what we don't have is better than what we do have um so why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="706" display="11:46" %}} - would they want it well because they didn't trust that God gave them what they should have that what they had was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="713" display="11:53" %}} - good and that God had you know put them in the right state for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="718" display="11:58" %}} - them to be and that's why this whole fight we have is a fight of Faith a fight of trusting that what God does is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="725" display="12:05" %}} - good that that he loves us and that what he gives for us gives to us is good for us it's exactly what happened with um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="732" display="12:12" %}} - Adam and Eve they had the Fountain of wisdom himself coming to walk with them  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="738" display="12:18" %}} - every evening they had a perfect garden everything was great but somehow they thought that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="747" display="12:27" %}} - one thing that God said that that's not good for you was what they needed more  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="753" display="12:33" %}} - than anything once Satan suggested it to them so the fact that anyone wants  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="761" display="12:41" %}} - something no matter how wise powerful smart or whatever they might be does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="766" display="12:46" %}} - in any way indicate that that thing was actually better for them than what they had it's not at all a way to think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="774" display="12:54" %}} - things so yeah the Angels wanted it simply because they could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="779" display="12:59" %}} - not because there was anything to suggest that they what what they had was not Superior to what they were looking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="785" display="13:05" %}} - for I mean to a certain extent this is the irrationality of sin I know I've  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="791" display="13:11" %}} - explained it this way I don't want to get super philosophical about it but when the Bible calls Jesus the Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="797" display="13:17" %}} - logos you know that word meaning reason I mean it means many things in Greek but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - God's universe is ordered and logical and fundamentally all sin is irrational  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="807" display="13:27" %}} - and so the question of why did the angelss seem to desire something that's lower than the estate that they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="813" display="13:33" %}} - currently possess it seems kind of like mad right well why does Satan rebel  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - against God why do any of us rebel against God um maybe that isn't the most  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="824" display="13:44" %}} - intellectually satisfying of answers but it really does get to the heart of this I think is that just because angels are uh you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="833" display="13:53" %}} - bigger and smarter than us so to speak doesn't mean that they don't suffer from the same spiritual blindness than we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="838" display="13:58" %}} - and that's spiritual blindness causes us to do things that a more objective third party Observer would say are irrational  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="845" display="14:05" %}} - um and in this particular case this is one such instance where by all accounts elect Angels don't have this same uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="852" display="14:12" %}} - desire temptation to do all of this and so it's it's just transgression of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="858" display="14:18" %}} - created order in a matter that we would term irrational um so I think that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="863" display="14:23" %}} - kind of the the way in which we ought to approach this issue um not so much that the angels are doing it for any great  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="870" display="14:30" %}} - purpose like there there there isn't more behind it in a plan as it's something that they don't have that they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="876" display="14:36" %}} - want and uh sin is always in some sense irrationally breaking God's natural  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="883" display="14:43" %}} - order yeah yeah I would say that I actually find the answer pretty intellectually satisfying myself because  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="890" display="14:50" %}} - all it all it says really is we always want some because we think it's better than  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="896" display="14:56" %}} - what we have and that that's just true we have that experience all the time it's very rare for people to go I want  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="903" display="15:03" %}} - something and that something is a change of of the order the state in which you are and it's not because as you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - think that what you want is better than what you're what you currently have I mean it's we have too many if we were to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="918" display="15:18" %}} - to go into all the experiences that demonstrate this we probably spend the whole night from this and there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="923" display="15:23" %}} - need for that so we could move on at I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - all right so with that I think that's where we're going to stop on our initial discussion of how God being spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="936" display="15:36" %}} - means he is set apart distinct from the universe uh he transcends it in a way  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="942" display="15:42" %}} - that even angels do not even though angels are above us in station for the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="947" display="15:47" %}} - time being as Hebrews talks about is that God even more than that because he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="952" display="15:52" %}} - is not a created being because he's not a created creature God is completely separate from matter and that makes him  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="960" display="16:00" %}} - unique in this characteristic as we will see for all of the other things that we talk about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="967" display="16:07" %}} - next all right so next we are going to be talking about how God is eternal and so what we just spent time covering was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - how God uh is not bound by matter or the material Universe uh because God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="979" display="16:19" %}} - spiritual and now we're talking about how God is not bound by time so God's being transcends time he's not limited  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="986" display="16:26" %}} - or bounded by temporal issues or concerns God is Not subject to time in any way God is Not constrained by time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - because God created time and employs it however he desires and so this is one of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1000" display="16:40" %}} - those things where again we as humans are just going to have a hard time wrapping our heads around exactly what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1006" display="16:46" %}} - it means to be outside of time because it's not a state in which we have any personal experience in uh plus when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1013" display="16:53" %}} - say something like before time even existed the concept of before is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1019" display="16:59" %}} - inherently wrapped up in time right um if we view time as kind of like a line then before is like more left on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1025" display="17:05" %}} - line well for a being that's outside of time there is no before there is no after because time is not something that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1033" display="17:13" %}} - that being is bound by and this is really hard for us to wrap in our minds um I would not feel discouraged if  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1040" display="17:20" %}} - thinking about this sometimes causes you to get confused because it confuses me um it's just not even something that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1047" display="17:27" %}} - honestly need to worry ourselves about to the greatest degree we just need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1053" display="17:33" %}} - understand that some of the concerns that test us and temper Us in life about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1058" display="17:38" %}} - not seeing how things are going to play out about this uncertain future about not knowing how the chips are going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1064" display="17:44" %}} - fall God is Not constrained in that same way God's plan sees from the very  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1070" display="17:50" %}} - beginning to the very end of of the history of the universe it sees everything uh in in an instant God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1076" display="17:56" %}} - planned everything before the initial events of creation were ever set in motion and that is very foreign to our  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1083" display="18:03" %}} - limited way of thinking because we think on imperfect information but God does not and so this is what we mean by God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1090" display="18:10" %}} - being Eternal is that he sees the beginning from or sorry the end from the beginning he is simply not bound by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1097" display="18:17" %}} - constraints of time that we are a you have points you want to bring up in reference to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1103" display="18:23" %}} - this yeah sure um I think the very first thing that we want to know is what time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1109" display="18:29" %}} - is uh physicists are having a hard time actually explaining what time is especially since um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1116" display="18:36" %}} - Einstein basically blew everybody's mind when he made it clear that time was not a constant when he discovered that time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1124" display="18:44" %}} - was not the constant it was thought to be well time is really the measure of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1130" display="18:50" %}} - change and God doesn't change so obviously there was nothing to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1137" display="18:57" %}} - measure that change if time exists for a being that does not change it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1142" display="19:02" %}} - actually a nonsensical concept it really does not mean anything you know so um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1151" display="19:11" %}} - the first thing I would say is that the very meaning of time does not apply to God since it's actually the measure of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1156" display="19:16" %}} - change and um the second thing I would say is that God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1162" display="19:22" %}} - eternality is explained entirely by the fact that he is that which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1169" display="19:29" %}} - so there is no was with God in the sense of him because if you look to God's past  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1178" display="19:38" %}} - what you see is the same thing that you see now and if you look to his future  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1183" display="19:43" %}} - what you see is the same thing that you see now there is no transformation in the state of his existence but that does  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1190" display="19:50" %}} - not mean that because God is outside and and when we use that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1197" display="19:57" %}} - that word it's it we have to construct we have to create mental constructs for trying to make sense of God so when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1204" display="20:04" %}} - say outside of time we have this feeling like there is a box in which time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1210" display="20:10" %}} - operates and God exists outside of it but God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1216" display="20:16" %}} - acting he is doing things and when he does  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1222" display="20:22" %}} - things there's a question um there's a question how how does his doing things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1230" display="20:30" %}} - interact with the fact that time exists outside of or that time does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1237" display="20:37" %}} - affect him is he not actually doing something create basically changing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1242" display="20:42" %}} - something and uh that is where I would bring in the analogy of uh the software engineer and his and his um software  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1250" display="20:50" %}} - he's he's changing states without actually being affected in any way by those changes he might put create an an  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1258" display="20:58" %}} - input in a particular program he has um designed and he gets a certain output he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1263" display="21:03" %}} - might make changes the state of the program and all of that but he himself is not in any way Changed by it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1270" display="21:10" %}} - so we we the creatures that God made have had to have a context within which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - we exist he does not need context he does not need anything in himself he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1282" display="21:22" %}} - perfectly complete so eternity in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1287" display="21:27" %}} - is is just like um uh would I say space eternity is like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1295" display="21:35" %}} - an expression of him rather than something that that he exists within  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1302" display="21:42" %}} - that is it it it is his own type of time no eternity is actually like this is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1308" display="21:48" %}} - aspect of myself that's what it is so likewise for us to appreciate God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1316" display="21:56" %}} - eternality we we first of all appreciate first that he does not change and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1322" display="22:02" %}} - therefore time is meaningless to him to the quality of his existence there's no change to measure but in order to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1331" display="22:11" %}} - interact with us and to bring about the state of things that he wants he has  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1337" display="22:17" %}} - created time to allow us to exist exist within a certain context and to work out  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1344" display="22:24" %}} - what he has intended so time for us it is for our  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1350" display="22:30" %}} - benefit otherwise we couldn't make sense of life right and I think fundamentally  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1355" display="22:35" %}} - the point is that time is created God created time right it's not like it's some aspect within which he works like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1362" display="22:42" %}} - you said um because it is fundamentally tied up with existence like you brought up time is something that was created as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1370" display="22:50" %}} - part of the creation of the universe you know bringing back up the physicist there's this thing relativity is this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1375" display="22:55" %}} - idea of space is linked to time the two things are not unrelated it is very much  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1381" display="23:01" %}} - part of creation and again we have a really hard time understanding exactly what that means for God not having that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1388" display="23:08" %}} - but it is just very important for us to emphasize that God is not bound by it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1393" display="23:13" %}} - because God created it um and really I think that is more or less the gist of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1399" display="23:19" %}} - what we have to say on this matter is simply that even though it's hard for us to understand and conceptualize God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1405" display="23:25" %}} - separate from time um and that means that how he approaches the sequence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1410" display="23:30" %}} - events that happen in the material universe is very fundamentally different from how we as fly night creatures who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1416" display="23:36" %}} - don't have that don't have that externality to time can approach things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1422" display="23:42" %}} - um all right uh good question here well observation question um so first off  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1428" display="23:48" %}} - angels are subject to time um we spent a good bit of the last uh point that we were discussing talking about how God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1434" display="23:54" %}} - spirituality is fundamentally different than angels and that angels are still material they're in the material  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1440" display="24:00" %}} - creation well so too with time Angels they don't see the future um so to speak they are not outside of time they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1447" display="24:07" %}} - within time space or SpaceTime time space isn't a word SpaceTime just how we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1452" display="24:12" %}} - are and so that makes them again more similar to us than they are to God in this even though Angels uh have  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1458" display="24:18" %}} - different capabilities than we do um uh they are different creatures with different Natures than we have they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1465" display="24:25" %}} - nonetheless still created creatures within SpaceTime and an interesting observation also related to this idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1474" display="24:34" %}} - how time works and and God's externality to it is this idea of future Prophecy in the Bible um and so uh sometimes it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1482" display="24:42" %}} - just people are told what's are are told what's going to happen uh God tells them  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1487" display="24:47" %}} - what is going to happen sorry um future events but when we have this case of Visions um so uh we might think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1495" display="24:55" %}} - John with the Book of Revelation for example was it just that John was given I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1501" display="25:01" %}} - know like a movie so to speak of what was going to happen in the future or was John actually transported into the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1507" display="25:07" %}} - future thereby seeing the events that were going to happen uh I I I don't want  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1512" display="25:12" %}} - to like punt on the question to me it sort of doesn't seem like the answer matters um because either way in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1521" display="25:21" %}} - Book of Revelation we are being given um this description of future events  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1526" display="25:26" %}} - whether that is John was simply given to see the manifestation of what would  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1532" display="25:32" %}} - happen or whether he was actually somehow transported picked up from um if you view time as a stream picked up from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1539" display="25:39" %}} - one place in the Stream and put in a futured place in the Stream and then brought back I don't think it really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1544" display="25:44" %}} - changes the the essence of the fact that the vision that Jon saw was the future  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1551" display="25:51" %}} - um Audie do you think that it has an impact should should we take a stand on  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1556" display="25:56" %}} - this yeah I I don't I don't think it really matters it's it's an interesting  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1562" display="26:02" %}} - question and uh there there are all sorts of interesting questions out there even with us me personally and pro  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1571" display="26:11" %}} - Robert has has also confessed to having questions of All Sorts that the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1576" display="26:16" %}} - does not actually give answers to uh I do remember how Ezekiel said that um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1583" display="26:23" %}} - the spirit lifted him by the the locks of his head and um took him to such and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1589" display="26:29" %}} - such a place and he saw this and he saw that and all of that so it's almost like they were transported forward in time to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1595" display="26:35" %}} - see things happening as they unfolded now I don't really know or particularly  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1600" display="26:40" %}} - care the reason for that is this we know that God has control of time whether he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1607" display="26:47" %}} - can pick you up from the present and transport you to the Future so that you witness things happening or he actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1614" display="26:54" %}} - shows you things as they will happen in the future before they actually happen I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1620" display="27:00" %}} - don't think it makes that big of a difference we know that God controls  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1626" display="27:06" %}} - time he controls it and we have two um demonstrations in the Bible of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1633" display="27:13" %}} - control of time he W time back when he was uh speaking to ahaz the king who was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1641" display="27:21" %}} - an unrighteous king of Judah who didn't want to listen to reason and uh Isaiah said well this is how God will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - demonstrate to you that what he has said will happen he caus the sun dial to go back 10° um then there was Joshua who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1656" display="27:36" %}} - was fighting um I think it was the amalekites he was fighting I don't remember that whom he was fighting  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1663" display="27:43" %}} - anymore but during that uh battle he basically paused time now how that could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1671" display="27:51" %}} - possibly happen that time would pause and everything would keep going as it was I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1678" display="27:58" %}} - go knock yourself out with the physics of it but it did happen that's what the Bible says so all of that tells us that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1686" display="28:06" %}} - God does have the power to do whatever he wants with time and as for space the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1693" display="28:13" %}} - Lord Jesus could show up at any place whenever he wanted after he rose from the dead and you couldn't keep him out  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1700" display="28:20" %}} - with locked doors so when you take all of that into account there is nothing too hard for the Lord he could totally  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1708" display="28:28" %}} - cause a profet to time travel but I'm not sure knowing that he did or didn't do it is going to really make that of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1717" display="28:37" %}} - difference to our understanding of the scriptures or of him we do know that his power is absolute so y I think that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1724" display="28:44" %}} - probably the best answer for us on this is just either way I it does not really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1730" display="28:50" %}} - affect the fact that God is in complete control of time um and it's not bad to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - ask questions what I would call questions of curiosity how how exactly does this work you know what does it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1741" display="29:01" %}} - mean for XYZ if the Bible doesn't talk about it um there are certain things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - that we just can't take hard firm positions on that doesn't mean that they aren't interesting in some respects but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1752" display="29:12" %}} - it also kind of means that maybe it's not something that we're given to know and that means that usually I would say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1758" display="29:18" %}} - as a rule of thumb it's dangerous to spend lots of time on these things just because uh not that there's anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1764" display="29:24" %}} - wrong being curious or asking questions but if it was something that we needed to know God would have given us  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1769" display="29:29" %}} - information on it right um simple as that so um I think it's a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1774" display="29:34" %}} - interesting question of were prophets actually transported into the future or did they just see visions of the future  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1779" display="29:39" %}} - how does that work uh who knows either way God is in complete control of the flow of time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1787" display="29:47" %}} - um so I think that's a good place for us here so just how God is in complete control of matter and uh all of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1793" display="29:53" %}} - material things in the universe God is in complete control of time because he is Eternal and separate from it and next  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1799" display="29:59" %}} - we'll be talking about the same deal except for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1805" display="30:05" %}} - space all right so uh as we just said next we're just going to be talking about the exact same sort of concept  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1811" display="30:11" %}} - that we have been with matter and time except now with regards to space so God's being transcends space he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1818" display="30:18" %}} - limited or bounded by spatial issues or concerns he's not subject to space in any way and again God is Not confined by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1825" display="30:25" %}} - space because he created it and employs it however he desires so we have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1830" display="30:30" %}} - same idea of God being the Creator the one outside of creation who has the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1836" display="30:36" %}} - strings uh in his hand so to speak and so the idea that God is somehow Bound by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1842" display="30:42" %}} - this thing that he himself made is just completely nonsensical on the face of it um and so AI brought up an example uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1850" display="30:50" %}} - when we were just talking about Jesus uh not being bound by space after the resurrection and so uh the the gospels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1857" display="30:57" %}} - are clear that the disciples were in a room with a locked door and then Jesus appeared among them um and so that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1863" display="31:03" %}} - just an one example here um but uh you know this is what we mean by God not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1869" display="31:09" %}} - being bound by space um also God uh can control things within space he can uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1876" display="31:16" %}} - you know do you know and and this is where it gets a little bit fuzzy if you squint you hard at the physics behind it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1882" display="31:22" %}} - so uh matter and space and time they're all related um in these equations that we don't need to go into but the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1890" display="31:30" %}} - is all of it is creation and God is not bound by his creation and if you were to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1895" display="31:35" %}} - summarize the three things that we've been talking about here matter time and space is that all of these things are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1901" display="31:41" %}} - part of creation and God is not part of creation God exists before creation um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1908" display="31:48" %}} - god well I I rather I should say God exists right that's what his nature is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1913" display="31:53" %}} - and God created what we now have around us and he's not part of it and that's really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1919" display="31:59" %}} - the fundamental basis of all three of these is simply that God is not at all constrained by the things that constrain  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1926" display="32:06" %}} - Us in creation because he is not himself a created creature um you have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1932" display="32:12" %}} - specifically related to space to bring up AI um I I I don't think so but I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1938" display="32:18" %}} - think you uh you make a very a very solid Point once you say look we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1946" display="32:26" %}} - talking about that which isn't created and I I like to make a bit of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1951" display="32:31" %}} - difference between um the deity of the Trinity and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1957" display="32:37" %}} - the persons of the Trinity the reason I make that difference is this or the identity I think um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1965" display="32:45" %}} - identity of Trinity the identity of God and the deity of God the reason I like to make that difference is the thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1972" display="32:52" %}} - that makes a thing God is simply the isness of the thing the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1977" display="32:57" %}} - it just is there is no explanation for its existence there is no agent that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1986" display="33:06" %}} - that speaks to why it exists nothing made it and nothing can affect its  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1992" display="33:12" %}} - existence you can't change it in any way can't affect it in any in any way that quality of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1999" display="33:19" %}} - deity once we understand it makes everything make all the sense in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2005" display="33:25" %}} - world because then it can't be creation creation does not possess that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2012" display="33:32" %}} - quality and space does not possess that quality because black holes for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2020" display="33:40" %}} - example there are weird things that happen we've been talking about the expans the expansion of of of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2028" display="33:48" %}} - universe because of how we are we are measuring um the red shifts I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2034" display="33:54" %}} - that's what they call it yeah it's red shift yeah so we're measuring those things that tell us that something is happening  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2041" display="34:01" %}} - to the very fabric of the universe in which we exist everything that we see  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2047" display="34:07" %}} - changes it and change is a response to something external to whatever is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2052" display="34:12" %}} - changing so if space itself is transforming then  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2057" display="34:17" %}} - space does not possess the quality of deity and that which possesses the quality of deity cannot be subject to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2063" display="34:23" %}} - anything that is subject to change MH so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2069" display="34:29" %}} - therefore we can we can comprehend all these arguments are essentially to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2074" display="34:34" %}} - look the Bible makes sense because when you think about it it makes sense that's it so well consistent like you said with  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2082" display="34:42" %}} - drawing this distinction between deity being fundamentally distinct from creation um and creation cannot be deity  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2091" display="34:51" %}} - on this account um you know it's sort of at least posted on the Forum you know I may get to that at some other point but this idea a that the universe is God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2099" display="34:59" %}} - complete garbage because the universe changes and God doesn't change like just on the surface of it it doesn't work  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2105" display="35:05" %}} - right um and that's because God is being God is unchanging as AI has just brought  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2111" display="35:11" %}} - up makes it fundamentally distinct from everything that is created in creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2116" display="35:16" %}} - um including space right um so uh that's a good that's a good place to end our  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2123" display="35:23" %}} - initial introduction to these so next we're going to be talking about how some of these attribut that we've discussed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2128" display="35:28" %}} - here so the fact that God's spiritual that he's Eternal and that he's immeasurable make God unique among  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2134" display="35:34" %}} - beings and so that's what we're going to turn to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2141" display="35:41" %}} - next all right so when we say that God is unique this kind of might seem like a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2146" display="35:46" %}} - no duh teaching well of course there's only one God right you know we don't believe in a Pantheon in fact there only  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2153" display="35:53" %}} - could be one God from a logical standpoint right um because if there are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2158" display="35:58" %}} - more than one well were they all equally existent you have all these other sorts of issues and uh interestingly like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2164" display="36:04" %}} - pantheons never seem to never seem to kind of handle that so well like do gods exist within other gods or they all kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2171" display="36:11" %}} - of if you squint hearted them enough they have what I would call uh existential logical issues with how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2178" display="36:18" %}} - work but not so for us because as we've just spent time discussing deity exists external to Creation God is not part of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2186" display="36:26" %}} - creation God is being he's existence he does not change and so all that to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2192" display="36:32" %}} - it should be sort of self-evident that well there's only one being like that and that being is God and nothing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2198" display="36:38" %}} - is created is at all like him because this characteristic of deity like AI has just pointed out that is what makes God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2206" display="36:46" %}} - unique um I mean among other things right it has all these consequences that we've been going through with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2211" display="36:51" %}} - spirituality the fact that God is eternal God is immeasurable and the manifestations of those things in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2217" display="36:57" %}} - creation which is what we'll look at next as we get through this section but the whole point is that all of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2223" display="37:03" %}} - things together mean that there is no one and nothing else like God um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2228" display="37:08" %}} - that's what we mean when we say that God is unique um it comes from God's infinite nature no one else in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2234" display="37:14" %}} - universe can reasonably be compared to him he's absolutely unique within creation even though God's not bound by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2241" display="37:21" %}} - creation right uh as a person who acts within creation no one has the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2246" display="37:26" %}} - properties that he has no one has his infinite nature and therefore he is the one person to whom all honor is due um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2254" display="37:34" %}} - as the deao ruler of creation by existential Fiat it's kind of a mouthful  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2260" display="37:40" %}} - but it's saying that on account of who God Is His Infinite nature the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2265" display="37:45" %}} - he is the creator all creation owes him that honor and respect simply on account  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2272" display="37:52" %}} - of who he is um because of these attributes that he has right right we're saying that God's Infinity illuminates  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2278" display="37:58" %}} - his abilities that was kind of the intro slide that God is going on this they illuminate his abilities because of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2284" display="38:04" %}} - abilities because of his uniqueness he is the de facto ruler of the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2289" display="38:09" %}} - and so from the standpoint of his Transcendence of the physical Universe uh God is unique by virtue of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2295" display="38:15" %}} - spirituality eternity and immeasurability and so this is kind of going to be the bridge here and that's why this section at least to my  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2302" display="38:22" %}} - knowledge that's why Dr lug has laid out this section as he has is because we're now going to be going from these three  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2309" display="38:29" %}} - characteristics which are the essential qualities of God right God is these things um now to our minds we kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2316" display="38:36" %}} - have a hard time thinking of them external to the universe but these are the the qualities of God who make God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2322" display="38:42" %}} - who he is um kind of not in reference to the universe and now we're going to be shifting our attention um to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2330" display="38:50" %}} - manifestations of these qualities as they relate to God's actions within the universe within creation and so God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2337" display="38:57" %}} - transcends the physical Universe because he's spiritual um he's Eternal and he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2342" display="39:02" %}} - immeasurable but within how he relates to the physical Universe he is supreme  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2348" display="39:08" %}} - within the physical Universe in that he's omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent and those three if you think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2355" display="39:15" %}} - about them actually correspond to these other attributes that we've just gone over so God is omnipotent because he can  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2362" display="39:22" %}} - affect whatever he wants in the physical Universe with m matter because he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2368" display="39:28" %}} - external to it right he's not bound by the laws that govern the rest of matter in the universe because God created  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2373" display="39:33" %}} - matter same deal with omniscience if God sees the end from the beginning well of what consequences time to God and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2380" display="39:40" %}} - is why God knows everything because from the beginning to the end and even that which was not has not been the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2386" display="39:46" %}} - hypothetical so to speak God knows it all because God is external to time and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2391" display="39:51" %}} - the omnipresence well if you can't contain God in one place that's what it means that God is everywhere because God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2398" display="39:58" %}} - is simply not a created creature he's not bound by these these rules of the universe that govern all other created  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2404" display="40:04" %}} - beings now I made this chart here um uh the study doesn't have it this is just stuff directly out of the study and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2411" display="40:11" %}} - can be helpful you know visual a can be helpful for us kind of having an easier way to track some of the things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2417" display="40:17" %}} - we're talking about here so when we say that God is unique we say he's unique  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2423" display="40:23" %}} - because he's spiritual rather than being bound by matter and how that manifests in creation is that he's omnipotent God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2429" display="40:29" %}} - may affect material creation however he pleases and when we say that he's Eternal rather than being bound by time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2436" display="40:36" %}} - that means that God's omniscient uh God knows everything in creation from beginning to end and even that which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2442" display="40:42" %}} - could have been um he's immeasurable rather than being bound by space and that manifests is him being omnipresent  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2449" display="40:49" %}} - he's ever present in creation as far as the East is from the West so nothing can separate us from God and the the love of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2456" display="40:56" %}} - God is kind of the scripture I'm paraphrasing there and so all this together means that while we may not be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2462" display="41:02" %}} - properly able to fully grasp God's true nature since we ourselves are small finite beings Bound by SpaceTime it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2469" display="41:09" %}} - should nonetheless be clearly apparent to us that it's not possible for any other created creature to compare with  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2475" display="41:15" %}} - the Creator um and that's simply because no other creature is outside of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2480" display="41:20" %}} - limitations like God is so even creatures far more powerful than ourselves so Satan and the other angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2486" display="41:26" %}} - they are bound and limited in ways God is Not and so that leaves God completely alone in and unique in his Transcendence  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2494" display="41:34" %}} - of and Supremacy within the physical universe and this right here this is why we say that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2501" display="41:41" %}} - unique so uh Audie do you have any points you want to say about kind of what we've gone through here um you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2508" display="41:48" %}} - this kind of bridge the transition between these essential qualities of God we've been going to and then how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2514" display="41:54" %}} - manifest within creation yeah um the first thing I want to say about that is the reason that there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2522" display="42:02" %}} - even a a question or there is any any mention of God's uniqueness is that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2528" display="42:08" %}} - is actually the whole point of all the fighting so to speak the the war in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2536" display="42:16" %}} - creation because Satan essentially went why should he have it and I don't get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2542" display="42:22" %}} - have it and every sin that we commit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2548" display="42:28" %}} - everything that um all all the issues of sin that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2553" display="42:33" %}} - have arise from a heart that says why does God get to be God and I don't get  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2560" display="42:40" %}} - to be God because the idea is what makes him so special I can also make my own  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2567" display="42:47" %}} - choices I can also determine what I will be and we must remember that this is why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2574" display="42:54" %}} - we are in the image of God that we possess the ability to self-determine we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2580" display="43:00" %}} - have the ability to self-define so we can say this is what I want to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2585" display="43:05" %}} - relative to God that's what free will really is that we possess the ability to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2590" display="43:10" %}} - define or explain ourselves relative to God and because we possess that and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2598" display="43:18" %}} - is exactly why the argument he just made for how there cannot be more than one God makes all the sense in the world  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2604" display="43:24" %}} - creature Rebellion is AB proof that there can only be one God because if there are more than one creation would  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2611" display="43:31" %}} - not exist there would be at loggerheads all the time and they would essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2617" display="43:37" %}} - either want to create multiple universes and if as long as they're in Conflict they cannot have this they can't let  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2625" display="43:45" %}} - anything else exist they would be locked in Eternal conflict forever but we know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - that there are three Persons Of God and these three Persons Of God are in perfect Unity and that is also proof for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - why there is one God because if they if they are all in perfect Unity they cannot be multiple gods in the sense of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2647" display="44:07" %}} - possessing multiple Wills multiple desires multiple projections  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2654" display="44:14" %}} - and expectations and whatnot the very essence of godhead of of deity is that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2661" display="44:21" %}} - am that which is not affected by anything outside of myself and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2666" display="44:26" %}} - more than one God exists they would have issues with affecting each other yeah I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2672" display="44:32" %}} - mean I almost don't think to a certain extent that we have to go worry ourselves with uh arguing against the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2678" display="44:38" %}} - concept because to some extent scripture is clear that there is one God right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2683" display="44:43" %}} - you know even Old Testament got that so I I'm not saying we can't talk about it it's just to us that's the important  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2689" display="44:49" %}} - part yeah we're not going into that the reason that this is actually raised is to explain the matter of the uniqueen of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2696" display="44:56" %}} - God while we're even talking about it that uniqueness is the point of all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2702" display="45:02" %}} - fighting we are having because as long as a creature can say I can be God too  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2710" display="45:10" %}} - then what's special about God and that's why that's why the Bible is shaped the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2715" display="45:15" %}} - way it is um I think I had a conversation yes I had a conversation with someone on my way back from church  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2721" display="45:21" %}} - today and I had to tell her I don't present and I don't believe that the Bible is a manual of in instruction so I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2728" display="45:28" %}} - don't teach you what to do and what not to do and what is right and what is not right I teach you who God is so that you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2735" display="45:35" %}} - see how different he is from you and from everybody else you get to know his plan so that you know exactly what he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2742" display="45:42" %}} - aiming to accomplish as a thing that's different from what you are aiming to accomplish and what everybody else is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2747" display="45:47" %}} - aiming to accomplish in other words I'm showing you the uniqueness of God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2752" display="45:52" %}} - that's the point that's the point Satan could say I will Ascend to and I will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2759" display="45:59" %}} - make my own place I will be like the most high as if you can be like him you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2767" display="46:07" %}} - are not like him not even remotely so and that's the point so like you said um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2773" display="46:13" %}} - all of these uh other qualities that came into play um they they essentially demonstrate his uniqueness and all sorts  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2779" display="46:19" %}} - of ways that is absolutely true they show his Transcendence over creation but more importantly they show his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2786" display="46:26" %}} - Transcendence over us that is me personally this is the difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2791" display="46:31" %}} - between me and God and this is why he gets to say what should be and I get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2798" display="46:38" %}} - say I'd like to go with you I agree with you I submit to what you want I will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2803" display="46:43" %}} - work with you to accomplish it because I don't know half the things you know you know everything and I don't have half  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2809" display="46:49" %}} - the power you have you you have all the power whatever you don't do doesn't get done I I can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2816" display="46:56" %}} - um be everywhere at once to accomplish my this and and again look when he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2822" display="47:02" %}} - tested job these things are what he brought to bear he showed him look at the difference between me and you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2828" display="47:08" %}} - think you're so wise you think you're so smart that you can even judge me now would you can you do this can you do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2834" display="47:14" %}} - that do you understand this do you know that have you been here have you been there do you know where the the snow  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2841" display="47:21" %}} - comes from and all of that stuff he was essentially saying look at the the gulf the wide go between who you are and who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2847" display="47:27" %}} - I am and when you see that for what it is do you really think you can judge me  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2853" display="47:33" %}} - can you sit in Judgment of God so this is why we're interested at all in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2860" display="47:40" %}} - talk about God's uniqueness we're essentially saying it is impossible for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2866" display="47:46" %}} - there to be more than one God we are certainly not candidates for that other God that be and Satan is most definitely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2874" display="47:54" %}} - not a candidate for the other God that ought to be there is only one every other claim to deity to godhood is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2883" display="48:03" %}} - lie that's what this is about because they can never have these attributes  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2888" display="48:08" %}} - that we're talking about only a being who created what currently exists who's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2893" display="48:13" %}} - outside of it can have these attributes nothing that exists within creation can be spiritual truly like separate from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2901" display="48:21" %}} - creation right nothing that exists within time can be separate from time it just it doesn't make sense right it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2907" display="48:27" %}} - impossible and so this is the madness the existential futility of Satan's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2913" display="48:33" %}} - rebellion and uh you know as uh the satanic rebelling series on ichus talks  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2918" display="48:38" %}} - about this this idea that humans have about you know I am like God God needs  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2924" display="48:44" %}} - me that progression of self- delusion again the insanity of this as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2930" display="48:50" %}} - Audi is pointing out the reason why we talk about the uniqueness of God is because this this uniqueness that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2936" display="48:56" %}} - talking about it means that we we owe God God is the one who controls the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2941" display="49:01" %}} - universe and because of that he's the one with all the authority in the universe not us um we don't control the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2948" display="49:08" %}} - things like God does and for that reason God's uniqueness gives him de facto  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2954" display="49:14" %}} - rulership and Supremacy within the universe because among other things no one can oppose him not really uh even  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2960" display="49:20" %}} - Satan's plan Satan's only dancing in the palm of God's hand because Satan can do nothing that God does not allow to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2967" display="49:27" %}} - happen um there is no battle between good and evil where you have Stakes that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2973" display="49:33" %}} - you're not sure who wins God won from the time that history first started there is no competition so to speak and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2980" display="49:40" %}} - that's because God is unique within the universe no one can compare to him no one has these attributes except for him  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2988" display="49:48" %}} - so um I think that's where we'll conclude this I mean obviously uh this bridge that we've spent talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2994" display="49:54" %}} - here going from these essential qualities of God to how they manifest in creation as omnipotence omniscience and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2999" display="49:59" %}} - omnipresence but we're going to be talking about those things next but that's kind of how this section Works in taking us from the one to the other  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3006" display="50:06" %}} - talking about how these things make God unique by nature and no one can compare to him on that account so I think that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3013" display="50:13" %}} - where we're going to stop here and we will be picking up next talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3020" display="50:20" %}} - omnipotence all right so having just talked about how God is unique and he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3025" display="50:25" %}} - unique on account of his spirituality giving him complete dominion over material things in creation his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3032" display="50:32" %}} - externality to time his eternity giving him complete knowledge of things in creation and his immeasurability uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3040" display="50:40" %}} - giving him the ability to be present at all places in etern or in creation um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3045" display="50:45" %}} - those latter three things that's what we're going to be focusing on now starting with uh omnipotence this idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3052" display="50:52" %}} - that because God is outside of SpaceTime he can control everything within SpaceTime it's his right um his ability  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3059" display="50:59" %}} - to do this is because he can affect whatever changes he wants within the material realm nothing can transpire  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3067" display="51:07" %}} - except that which God happens or allows to happen based on the Free Will decisions of others therefore there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3074" display="51:14" %}} - no deed nor was there ever nor will there ever be which God is unable to do small or great within material creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3082" display="51:22" %}} - um and so I wanted to uh start off a bit of the discussion that we have here  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3087" display="51:27" %}} - talking about this question that you may have heard posed um something like so could God create a rock so big even he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3094" display="51:34" %}} - couldn't lift it um sometimes this comes up somewhat tongue and cheek sometimes people are actually serious in raising  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3100" display="51:40" %}} - this as an objection and so this is supposedly pitting two aspects of omnipotence against each other so on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3107" display="51:47" %}} - one side God's ability to create anything he wishes ex nilo that's Latin it means out of nothing so for for God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - ability to create um versus God's strength his ability to do things to manipulate material creation um and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3122" display="52:02" %}} - the people who make this argument they argue that the two superlatives mandated by omnipotence contradict each other so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3128" display="52:08" %}} - supposedly if God cannot create an object too heavy for him to lift he's not omnipotent because an omnipotent  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3134" display="52:14" %}} - creature would be able to create anything and likewise if there would exist some object that God could create  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3139" display="52:19" %}} - but he was unable to lift then he also would not be omnipotent because an omnipotent creature would be able to lift everything so people who make this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3146" display="52:26" %}} - argument they kind of say something like see either way he can't do something therefore he's not omnipotent now of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3151" display="52:31" %}} - course we don't agree with this argument as Christians and I'm about to explain why and this is one reason why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3156" display="52:36" %}} - apologetics um just as a side tangent is best engaged in with those who have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3161" display="52:41" %}} - gifts the requisite um gifting from God empowerment of the Holy Spirit and uh proper preparation to handle things like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3168" display="52:48" %}} - this appropriately because it's easy to get confused and tripped up and maybe not give as convincing an answer as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3174" display="52:54" %}} - ought as Christians when confronted with objections to the truth because this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3179" display="52:59" %}} - truth that we're talking about this is an objection to the idea of God's omnipotence that's kind of why I'm bringing it up just to highlight no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3186" display="53:06" %}} - really God is omnipotent what we mean by that okay so how do we handle this this supposed situation of contradiction that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3192" display="53:12" %}} - people bring up so we can let people who don't want to believe or we can kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3198" display="53:18" %}} - let them go on their way and this is kind of what I mean by we don't always have to take up this debate especially  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3203" display="53:23" %}} - if maybe it's not the right thing for you to do in a second but also and more to the point here it's not our job to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3210" display="53:30" %}} - convince people if people are going to not believe in God because of this there's almost nothing we can do their  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3217" display="53:37" %}} - hearts are already closed off to the truth and you'll see what I mean in a second here and so to answer this it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3222" display="53:42" %}} - obvious I'm GNA emphasize it again obvious that God can both create whatsoever he wishes and also manipulate  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3229" display="53:49" %}} - Creation in whatever way he wishes that's what we mean when we say that God's omnipotent so the idea of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3235" display="53:55" %}} - material object that he cannot create is definitionally impossible right it just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3241" display="54:01" %}} - it cannot happen and so to is a material object he cannot manipulate that he cannot change he cannot affect within  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3248" display="54:08" %}} - creation so lifting The Rock in this case so put differently there is no such thing as an object he could create but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3254" display="54:14" %}} - not lift or an object he could lift but not create that thing just doesn't exist the entire objection here is circular by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3262" display="54:22" %}} - assuming that such a thing can exist to begin with and so when we say that that means that people who they raise this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3269" display="54:29" %}} - point they think they're they're so clever for this they've already put God in a box from the very beginning they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3275" display="54:35" %}} - already limiting what he can do just by the very way they phrase this and then they only proceed to smugly knock down  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3281" display="54:41" %}} - nothing but a straw man so they're not even addressing the real points in hand and again that's because anything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3287" display="54:47" %}} - God could create he could lift by definition there is no such thing as an object where he can do one but not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3293" display="54:53" %}} - other and so I might say Okay step why are we why are we talking about this right I'm not that interested I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3298" display="54:58" %}} - raise that objection so the reason is because it kind of helps throw into relief what God can do right this is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3306" display="55:06" %}} - what we have in our heads we we don't have these logic puzzles when we say that God's omnipotent we know that God can do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3313" display="55:13" %}} - anything whatever anything might be um God can do it whatever it may be and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3318" display="55:18" %}} - with that we follow El Shai God Almighty the the leader of Angel hosts he who was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3324" display="55:24" %}} - an is and is to come the person who holds the very strings of the universe in his hands and can create or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3330" display="55:30" %}} - annihilate galaxies in the blink of an eye that's what we mean when we are talking about omnipotence not not this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3336" display="55:36" %}} - this hypothetical creature who might be able to create a rock right we're talking about the king of the universe the creator of everything that exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3344" display="55:44" %}} - and we' better fear that power and Majesty as we ought to uh to keep our own lives in perspective and so uh just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3351" display="55:51" %}} - to use a progression here to emphasize the point so as human beings we are tiny  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3357" display="55:57" %}} - compared to the vastness of just Earth much less our solar system much less our galaxy much less the universe itself but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3364" display="56:04" %}} - God is even bigger infinitely bigger in fact because he's not bound by it than the universe itself and God could snuff  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3371" display="56:11" %}} - out everything that exists in the blink of an eye if he decided to and so that is the kind of power in view when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3377" display="56:17" %}} - speak of God being omnipotent not that he actually will snop out the Universe on a whim but that it would be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3382" display="56:22" %}} - absolutely nothing for him to do so because he is in complete control of matter time and space and things only  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3389" display="56:29" %}} - exist because he causes them to exist it's not like they exist independent from his will and so to ties back um I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3398" display="56:38" %}} - don't know if other people find this interesting or or satisfying on an intellectual level to knock down  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3403" display="56:43" %}} - arguments like this but when we say God's omnipotent God really can do anything within material creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3410" display="56:50" %}} - because he controls it and so this idea that uh he couldn't do something uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3416" display="56:56" %}} - whatever skepticism or doubt that people might Express on this is just misplaced  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3421" display="57:01" %}} - because God is not in any way Bound by material creation and so as in this example it simply means that people come  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3428" display="57:08" %}} - in already thinking of God as a limited creature um as something Bound by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3433" display="57:13" %}} - rules in which we operate and that's just the wrong way to go about it because God is completely separate from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - the rules that govern all of creation so sorry I rambled a bit there but um this was something that I just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3445" display="57:25" %}} - thought it was worth us talking about as we examine this idea of omnipotence so a do you have anything you want to rip on  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3452" display="57:32" %}} - from what I've said or or other points you want to make on omnipotence itself uh yeah um let me say first of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3460" display="57:40" %}} - all that regarding the question you addressed the first time I heard in 2012 I'd never heard anything of that sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3467" display="57:47" %}} - and my fellow apologist then and I we used  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3473" display="57:53" %}} - to kind of people used to mistake us for each other on nirand then um I used to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3479" display="57:59" %}} - call him my twin because it seemed like we thought exactly the same his answer to that question was that's a word salad  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3487" display="58:07" %}} - it means exactly nothing like you can't explain you can't Define what you're talking about what's a rck that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3493" display="58:13" %}} - can't lift so something so um I know I know what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3499" display="58:19" %}} - behind it the idea is it's it's exactly like saying can God create a square circle because well God can do anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3506" display="58:26" %}} - can do everything so he must be able to do something completely nonsensical so um the answer that I find  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3517" display="58:37" %}} - in the scriptures for such things first of all is um there is nothing that God can't do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3524" display="58:44" %}} - and the first person to find out how wrong he was about what God can do and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3530" display="58:50" %}} - can't do was the wisest creature that God ever  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3536" display="58:56" %}} - made the one who should have been telling everybody just don't mess with him he knows he knows things you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3543" display="59:03" %}} - don't even begin to imagine like he's already thought about what you you have not yet begun to imagine or conceive in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3549" display="59:09" %}} - your in your heart that's the person who first thought I can box God into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3555" display="59:15" %}} - corner I can I can put him in a catch 22 where he his his hands are tied he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3561" display="59:21" %}} - thought well I can't beat God in an actual fight I can't go to war with God and win he's too powerful but I could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3568" display="59:28" %}} - outsmart him that was Satan and uh how did that turn out for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3574" display="59:34" %}} - him well you see this is where things get a little uh annoying for people like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3579" display="59:39" %}} - me we we live in in Trivial times that means Jesus has come and died on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3585" display="59:45" %}} - cross the miracle has happened so it's it's it's easy to trivialize we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3590" display="59:50" %}} - see the the Marvel of this thing we don't see the enmity of this miracle  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3597" display="59:57" %}} - that God can forgive a sinner that God can forgive a sinner That's what Satan said was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3604" display="1:00:04" %}} - impossible that he could put in a position where if he forgave a sinner he would be acting  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3609" display="1:00:09" %}} - unjustly and if he punished The Sinner he would be acting he would be negating his character of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3616" display="1:00:16" %}} - love he thought he had won and then God did this Jesus thing and all of a sudden  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3622" display="1:00:22" %}} - Satan is looking like a complete idiot now those who say he could he create a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3627" display="1:00:27" %}} - rock that he can't live they sound real smart and after all they're speaking English most of us who speak English can  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3633" display="1:00:33" %}} - make sense of the words that they just used and it sounds like yeah yeah I mean could he could he I mean he right if he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3641" display="1:00:41" %}} - creates a rock then and he can't lift it well he can create a rock but now he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3649" display="1:00:49" %}} - can't lift it where is it's like oh why and your head is blown right like you've  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3654" display="1:00:54" %}} - said you've just made so much sense you've boxed God into a corner now he can't exist precisely what Satan thought  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3662" display="1:01:02" %}} - like I can put him in a situation where he will be forced to abandon creation and I get to rule over  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3669" display="1:01:09" %}} - it we really can't win there's something that God said that Paul said through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3674" display="1:01:14" %}} - spirit in second Timothy Chapter 2 he said If you deny him he won't deny  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3680" display="1:01:20" %}} - himself so are there things God can do absolutely he won't lie he can't lie he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3686" display="1:01:26" %}} - can't deny himself there are all sorts of things God can do none of them is a reflection on his power all of them are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3694" display="1:01:34" %}} - reflection on his character there are lots of things God can do but if we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3700" display="1:01:40" %}} - talking about what his omnipotence actually means it doesn't mean he can he can create a rock that he can't lift his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3707" display="1:01:47" %}} - omnipotence means there is absolutely nothing that God could want to do that he want he can't do nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3715" display="1:01:55" %}} - like if God decided right now I want to create a sare circle he can create a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3720" display="1:02:00" %}} - square circle it doesn't make any kind of sense to us but I wouldn't bet against him so I don't even want to I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3726" display="1:02:06" %}} - don't even want to go there a roong that I can't lift yeah that's it's another nonsensical thing to imagine but I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3732" display="1:02:12" %}} - wouldn't bet against him if he decided that he wanted to do that that's the well but the whole point of why I framed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3739" display="1:02:19" %}} - this how I did was that the question itself is circular that there is no such  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3744" display="1:02:24" %}} - object right AB so so that's the whole thing in this is that now I will say you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3750" display="1:02:30" %}} - know scripture that comes to mind when we deal with this again is this idea of answering fools according to their Folly  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3755" display="1:02:35" %}} - I wouldn't even give people who make this argument the time of day most of the time they're not interested right no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3761" display="1:02:41" %}} - matter what you say they're not going to listen to you but the whole point of this is that the point that I was trying  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3767" display="1:02:47" %}} - to make when I brought this up was simply that we cannot in our thinking put God in a box and then speak of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3773" display="1:02:53" %}} - power in terms of the boxed version of God um we need to appreciate how big God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3779" display="1:02:59" %}} - is right yeah that's precisely right there is there is nothing wrong with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3785" display="1:03:05" %}} - answer that you gave it's actually where I'm starting from which is essentially this you don't know what God can or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3792" display="1:03:12" %}} - cannot do so shut it that's where you start then what is God's omnipotence the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3800" display="1:03:20" %}} - Bible is very clear there is nothing that God could possibly want to do that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3805" display="1:03:25" %}} - he can't do nothing can stop him in all of creation and this is what Satan keeps  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3810" display="1:03:30" %}} - learning time and time again and everybody that wants to oppose God I mean right now they're going bunkers  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3816" display="1:03:36" %}} - because of Technology because of science for the past 500 years we've been doing Miracles that they didn't think was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3822" display="1:03:42" %}} - possible now we've gone to the Moon we have launched all sorts of machines into  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3828" display="1:03:48" %}} - space we exploring things that our great-grandfathers didn't even know existed all sorts of things are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3833" display="1:03:53" %}} - happening in the the world today and people have lost their freaking minds they think now I'm God right because can God do all  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3843" display="1:04:03" %}} - this stuff I mean they're forgetting that all those things existed before they even learned how to you know put  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3849" display="1:04:09" %}} - anything together and send it to the Moon the Moon was already there how did it get there oh it was Evolution right  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3855" display="1:04:15" %}} - the nothing that exploded and became everything right so but for us who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3861" display="1:04:21" %}} - believe what we know from the scriptures is this there is nothing that God cannot do if  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3868" display="1:04:28" %}} - he wants to do it so if you create a logical impossibility I wouldn't bet on you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3876" display="1:04:36" %}} - winning against God assuming of course and what I'm assuming is that there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3881" display="1:04:41" %}} - any kind of sense in what you're saying now when Satan made his bet against the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3886" display="1:04:46" %}} - Lord and encouraged his fellow angels to to join him in that bed I'm absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3892" display="1:04:52" %}} - sure that while he was persuaded he he would win and those the third of the angels that agreed with him thought that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3897" display="1:04:57" %}} - they would win was that they were persuaded that this was an actual logical  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3902" display="1:05:02" %}} - impossibility if God is just and if God is loving well we can get away with sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3908" display="1:05:08" %}} - because you can't reconcile those two things well God did he did so again I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3915" display="1:05:15" %}} - would say I have no idea the limits and this is the most important thing I have  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3920" display="1:05:20" %}} - no idea what the limits are to God's power I have no idea so if you create  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3926" display="1:05:26" %}} - something that sounds absolutely idiotic and you think this is where I've caught God I've put him in a box he can't win  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3932" display="1:05:32" %}} - in this one I'm not betting on you against the Lord I'm simply not now if you said well I I I bet you the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3939" display="1:05:39" %}} - cannot lie yeah he said so I won't fight you on that one he can't lie if you say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3946" display="1:05:46" %}} - that um God God cannot um deny himself sure I'm with you on that I'll bet I'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3954" display="1:05:54" %}} - bet on you any day of the week every day of the week everything I've got God cannot deny himself but you see if there  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3962" display="1:06:02" %}} - is anything the Bible does not say God can do and that we can't reason from the Bible that he can't do and you think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3968" display="1:06:08" %}} - it's some kind of logical impossibility yeah I'm not going with you on that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3974" display="1:06:14" %}} - I'm we have plenty of counter examples of that going real poorly like you said  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3979" display="1:06:19" %}} - now I will say that these arguments that I've been that you've been bringing up like can God can God lie can God deny  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3985" display="1:06:25" %}} - himself those are have a little bit different character um so the particular logical trap here this this whole Rock  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3992" display="1:06:32" %}} - business I brought up as an example of one of those arguments that we don't even have to wave our hand at like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3998" display="1:06:38" %}} - argument is literally it assumes things and it's circular in that regard that's the point I tried to make some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4004" display="1:06:44" %}} - other things um this idea of well if God can't sin turn into an all powerful  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4009" display="1:06:49" %}} - being sin therefore God can't exist sort of thing the problem with those is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4015" display="1:06:55" %}} - that their definition of what all powerful is like where are they getting it from right this is always why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4021" display="1:07:01" %}} - defining terms is important now I don't want to go down the Apologetics Rabbit Trail I didn't want to get a super  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4026" display="1:07:06" %}} - sidetracked again I was bringing this up sort of as as a point to examine this idea of boxing God and whenever we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4034" display="1:07:14" %}} - that God is limited in some way we better revise our thinking and I think we've talked about it well right we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4040" display="1:07:20" %}} - used good examples your example of Satan thinking that he he caught God in this in this way to uh that God couldn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4047" display="1:07:27" %}} - somehow reconcile Sinners to himself that was Satan's PR campaign if you will it's a great example of what not to do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4055" display="1:07:35" %}} - right of trusting somehow that God can't do something uh whatever you're thinking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4061" display="1:07:41" %}} - you're probably wrong because God is in complete control he knows way better than we do about everything that happens  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4068" display="1:07:48" %}} - in the universe so um with that maybe we'll see if anyone has any questions  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4073" display="1:07:53" %}} - questions on this before we move on to the next one so this again is on the idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4080" display="1:08:00" %}} - omnipotence all right so that's probably where we'll we'll pivot from talking about God's omnipotence to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4088" display="1:08:08" %}} - omniscience and so we spent all this time talking about well what can God do and now we're going to talk about what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4093" display="1:08:13" %}} - does God know that's going to be the next thing that we focus  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4099" display="1:08:19" %}} - on all right so as to omniscience uh here's the text coming straight out of the study uh we have the idea that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4106" display="1:08:26" %}} - is all knowing irrespective of time so again this is how this corresponds to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4112" display="1:08:32" %}} - God being Eternal and outside of time is that God knows everything irrespective of time he knows the end from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4119" display="1:08:39" %}} - beginning he can affect anything he desires in the temporal realm therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4124" display="1:08:44" %}} - God knows always has known and always will know everything the end from the beginning as the Everlasting one his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4131" display="1:08:51" %}} - knowledge of every event that has or will or even could occur within his creation is comprehensive and absolute  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4139" display="1:08:59" %}} - so specific phrase that I wanted to pick out here is this this could occur business so it's not just knowing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4146" display="1:09:06" %}} - everything that has and is and will occur but everything that could have occurred as well so I do not want to get  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4154" display="1:09:14" %}} - too off in the weeds of the the theological thing people give this a label the so-called molinism with a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4161" display="1:09:21" %}} - capital m m o l i n ISM um and this idea of middle knowledge um I that's just the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4169" display="1:09:29" %}} - theological jargon here um I actually don't particularly like bogging ourselves down in the theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4176" display="1:09:36" %}} - arguments that have happened over this um uh there's a a reasonably famous apologist in our day his name is William  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4182" display="1:09:42" %}} - Lane Craig um he is a prominent proponent of this particular Doctrine um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4188" display="1:09:48" %}} - I kind of like to talk about independent from that so the example that I thought we'd bring up to talk about this idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4195" display="1:09:55" %}} - God knowing uh things that didn't just happen or or that that like happened in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4201" display="1:10:01" %}} - the past or will happen in the future but things uh kind of that this would have could have hypothetical sort of thing is uh when the Bible says that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4209" display="1:10:09" %}} - will never test us past what we can bear so that's 1 Corinthians 10:13 you know I could actually read full reference here  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4214" display="1:10:14" %}} - no temptation is overtaken you but such as is common to man and God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4220" display="1:10:20" %}} - beyond what you are able but with the Temptation will provide the way of Escape also so that you will be able to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4225" display="1:10:25" %}} - endure it now the Greek word here that is translated as Temptation in the nasb is also translated as testing um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4233" display="1:10:33" %}} - depending on context is how you know whether it's Temptation or testing um so this one can actually kind of go either  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4238" display="1:10:38" %}} - way that God will not test us past what we were able to bear um but the idea is well how does God know what we're able  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4245" display="1:10:45" %}} - to bear and the verse here implicitly requires that God knows where our limits  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4251" display="1:10:51" %}} - are how does God know that if it happens before we have actually done something and this is where you get into  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4258" display="1:10:58" %}} - this idea of this knowledge that God has is so complete that it even covers these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4264" display="1:11:04" %}} - situations past that which actually has or will occur hence middle knowledge  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4269" display="1:11:09" %}} - again I don't particularly like bogging ourselves down in uh some of the history so to speak here but it's necessary for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4277" display="1:11:17" %}} - God to know what what test we are and are not able to Bear he has to know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4282" display="1:11:22" %}} - whether we would or would not pass a test were he to give it to us right um seems kind of like common sense um another example you can use is divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4289" display="1:11:29" %}} - discipline um how does God know what discipline is necessary for us right he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4294" display="1:11:34" %}} - has to know what discipline will best lead to Turning us back to him right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4301" display="1:11:41" %}} - uh basically corresponding to the Free Will decisions we make in life well since we're all different we have these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4307" display="1:11:47" %}} - different um uh you know makeups talents aptitudes opinions everything thing uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4314" display="1:11:54" %}} - so the discipline with which now anyone who's had kids can probably relate to this uh the way in which you discipline  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4320" display="1:12:00" %}} - one child may need to be different than the way in which you discipline another so very encourageable little boys for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4325" display="1:12:05" %}} - example may need a much Sterner talking to than uh their more sensitive younger sisters for example um just not to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4332" display="1:12:12" %}} - generalize based on gender too much but uh you know sometimes people need a good bit more discipline uh because they're a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4339" display="1:12:19" %}} - little bit more resistant to it so God knows all of this perfectly he knows exactly what we need and what would and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4345" display="1:12:25" %}} - would not work with each of us specifically um all of this knowledge that we're getting at here this is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4351" display="1:12:31" %}} - knowledge of that which could be of the hypothetical and uh I for whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4357" display="1:12:37" %}} - reason some of this is controversial theologically um so to me these examples  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4363" display="1:12:43" %}} - I've raised 1 Corinthians 10:13 God will not test us past what I can bear seems just kind of like it makes sense for God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4369" display="1:12:49" %}} - to have this knowledge it's necessary for him to uh act in this way way that everything is perfectly mapped out right  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4375" display="1:12:55" %}} - we believe in the for ordination of all events before the beginning of human history and so uh God's perfect for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4382" display="1:13:02" %}} - ordination logically requires that he know everything about all potential paths in the mind-bogglingly complex  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4388" display="1:13:08" %}} - decision tree that spans the history of the entire universe so that's a really jargony way of saying that all of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4394" display="1:13:14" %}} - potentials that we're talking about for God's plan to be perfect he has to have already taken all of that into account  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4399" display="1:13:19" %}} - so it's kind of always puzzled me why people would ever think to argue against this um it's just this is just how big  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4406" display="1:13:26" %}} - God's knowledge is this is what it means when we say he's omnicient but alas some people do argue against this right and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4413" display="1:13:33" %}} - uh hypothesis Theory I don't know I cannot look into the hearts of people but perhaps it's because believing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4419" display="1:13:39" %}} - God knows even these things requires us to appreciate how truly big and unlike us uh who with our very finite  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4426" display="1:13:46" %}} - perspective that we have here within SpaceTime how unlike us God really is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4432" display="1:13:52" %}} - because for us this sort of knowledge is completely impossible for us to have we can't know what would or could happen  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4438" display="1:13:58" %}} - were this to you know were this event or that event to happen in our lives we can't predict that we have no idea but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4444" display="1:14:04" %}} - God does because he's God because he's external to creation and so for now  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4449" display="1:14:09" %}} - again another thing that I'm raising here you should just mostly ignore the fact in my opinion that some people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4455" display="1:14:15" %}} - again tried to put God into a box in their minds right so we talked about this with omnipotence we're now we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4461" display="1:14:21" %}} - talking about it with omniscience uh people who say well God can't know that that's you know it doesn't make sense it's not logical etc etc um uh well you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4469" display="1:14:29" %}} - should kind of ignore the fact that some people do put God In A Box in their minds and content yourself with the sure  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4474" display="1:14:34" %}} - confidence that God knows everything when we say everything that is unbounded we mean everything absolutely everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4480" display="1:14:40" %}} - inclusive of our Free Will decisions before we even make them it's for knowledge and so and God is also so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4487" display="1:14:47" %}} - infinitely wise as to have perfectly mapped out all of creature history before the universe was even created  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4492" display="1:14:52" %}} - God's plan perfectly captures everything from beginning to end there are no mistakes there is nothing that could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4499" display="1:14:59" %}} - happen that would be better than that which has already been foreordained and so this divine plan being worked out  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4505" display="1:15:05" %}} - around us God knows what he's doing he's not going to make mistakes and we need to have faith and trust in that so again  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4512" display="1:15:12" %}} - kind of introducing a way in which people box God in which they're not willing to accept that God knows everything and when we say everything we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4519" display="1:15:19" %}} - mean it everything um so a you want to bounce anything off of what I've said  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4525" display="1:15:25" %}} - here yeah I think I think uh the real sum of it um is is really God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4531" display="1:15:31" %}} - knowledge is perfect the Bible bears that out and um whenever we go into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4537" display="1:15:37" %}} - lot of the philosophy uh I know why molinism exists it's one of the answers  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4545" display="1:15:45" %}} - to trying to reconcile how God knows everything and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4551" display="1:15:51" %}} - yet we have free will it's one of those um theologies like you said we there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4557" display="1:15:57" %}} - quite a bit of getting into for that but I think I can say rather simply here  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4563" display="1:16:03" %}} - that first of all the Bible is absolutely clear that God's knowledge is perfect there is no um need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4572" display="1:16:12" %}} - accommodate some imperfection in God's knowledge if he has imperfect knowledge he's not God we should remember again  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4579" display="1:16:19" %}} - that what God is by nature is that which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4585" display="1:16:25" %}} - is and that is why the Bible tells us that his name is I will be what I am or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4592" display="1:16:32" %}} - I I I I am what I will be he's unaffected by time if his knowledge is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4599" display="1:16:39" %}} - affected by time then that definition becomes untrue if he has to learn things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4606" display="1:16:46" %}} - that definition becomes untrue if his knowledge depreciates loses value or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4612" display="1:16:52" %}} - quality over time that definition becomes untrue so he either has perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4619" display="1:16:59" %}} - knowledge or he is not God and this is actually how we can tell when something is not the true God it's one of the ways  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4625" display="1:17:05" %}} - we can tell that that thing does not have perfect knowledge that's why we can know for example that even a suser who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4632" display="1:17:12" %}} - who can predict like it was happening with uh the slave girl who had the spirit of divination right we could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4639" display="1:17:19" %}} - still say even with that demon rtion of power that is beyond human ability that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4646" display="1:17:26" %}} - was still not God we can tell that because like God said through one of the prophets bring  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4653" display="1:17:33" %}} - your divers find bring your Gods let's see who can predict the end from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4660" display="1:17:40" %}} - beginning like I can so God's knowledge is perfect that's not a question  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4665" display="1:17:45" %}} - molinism and questions of hypothesis what could be what would be and all of that stuff my answer to that is still  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4673" display="1:17:53" %}} - God knows everything and Jesus did demonstrate that matter of what could be when he talked about Sodom and Gomorrah  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4680" display="1:18:00" %}} - and yeah that is one of the proof text and this is why I didn't want to get into people argue about this very long  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4686" display="1:18:06" %}} - and audite but the idea that we're introducing here like Audi said is just that when we say God's knowledge is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4693" display="1:18:13" %}} - perfect we we mean it every every down to the last drgs of the logical  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4698" display="1:18:18" %}} - implication of that so to speak and yeah and here's need we just need to speak as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4704" display="1:18:24" %}} - if we actually believe that because people people in their heads again they try to put God in a box they try to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4710" display="1:18:30" %}} - well but but but and the answer is no like Audi said God's knowledge is perfect and complete from the beginning  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4718" display="1:18:38" %}} - to the end so I would say this a lot of times in in matters of discussing the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4724" display="1:18:44" %}} - Bible people don't discuss the Bible they want to talk philosophy and here's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4731" display="1:18:51" %}} - the thing we have to be look philosophy is good if it is good philosophy as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4739" display="1:18:59" %}} - matter of fact what we consider good philosophy is the Bible so if the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4744" display="1:19:04" %}} - says it it's true the Bible doesn't say it's suspect at at best it's suspect  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4750" display="1:19:10" %}} - best so if someone shows up and starts going into the ins and outs about why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4755" display="1:19:15" %}} - this or that is logical I'm listening for yeah the Bible actually does say or doesn't say if I don't hear that I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4761" display="1:19:21" %}} - really care what you're saying so if you're insisting that if he knew then this if he didn't know then that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4769" display="1:19:29" %}} - what I I I really don't care the question I want to hear or what I want to hear from you is the Bible says this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4776" display="1:19:36" %}} - or doesn't say that that's all so as far as I'm concerned the Bible is clear  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4782" display="1:19:42" %}} - about God's perfect knowledge and and complete knowledge there is no question  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4788" display="1:19:48" %}} - about whether God knows everything or doesn't know Peter himself said it to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4793" display="1:19:53" %}} - Jesus Christ you know all things you know that I love you so when God is asking us questions he's not seeking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4799" display="1:19:59" %}} - information that's very obvious so um having said that all questions that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4806" display="1:20:06" %}} - arise from if God knows we have to understand the answer  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4812" display="1:20:12" %}} - is not in he probably doesn't that's not where the answer to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4817" display="1:20:17" %}} - that question is if the question is how do I reconcile the fact that God has perfect knowledge to this is then  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4823" display="1:20:23" %}} - there's a third piece that you're missing you need to find that you cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4829" display="1:20:29" %}} - solve that problem by reducing what God knows because then you would make him less than God that's the end that I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4836" display="1:20:36" %}} - you know yeah no I mean and like I said not going to go down the full Rabbit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4842" display="1:20:42" %}} - Trail there um you you brought up the Sodom and gomorah passage there's other arguments I mean I made mine using the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4848" display="1:20:48" %}} - testing passage here from 1 Corinthians chapter 10 uh more of the point is is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4854" display="1:20:54" %}} - that the people who want to limit God to say that God can't know these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4860" display="1:21:00" %}} - somehow that it's logically impossible where are they getting that from right it's it's the same issue with the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4866" display="1:21:06" %}} - whole thing that we talked about about the limits people place upon God's omnipotence is that the limits that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4871" display="1:21:11" %}} - people who argue against I'm not even So Pro all the arguments that people use for this particular teaching in so far  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4877" display="1:21:17" %}} - as it just means that when we say God knows everything we really do mean everything um everything that has and is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4884" display="1:21:24" %}} - and will or could or could have or everything in between right because he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4889" display="1:21:29" %}} - God um and we just have to respect that that's all and so that is omniscience um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4895" display="1:21:35" %}} - God knows the end from the beginning God is in uh complete control of everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4900" display="1:21:40" %}} - that that has and is and will happen in the universe because God's plan is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4905" display="1:21:45" %}} - perfect it spans time from beginning to end because God knows all um that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4911" display="1:21:51" %}} - omniscience I think that's where we'll cut for omniscience and next we're going to talk about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4920" display="1:22:00" %}} - omnipresence all right so now that we finished our discussion here of omniscience uh talking about how just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4927" display="1:22:07" %}} - like with omnipotent some people kind of put God In A Box in their minds they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4932" display="1:22:12" %}} - right from the outset don't view him kind of as this being separate from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4937" display="1:22:17" %}} - SpaceTime but they try to contextualize him in terms of the way we might understand very powerful creatures that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4945" display="1:22:25" %}} - are still part of our universe well in the same way people might not always appreciate that God is absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4952" display="1:22:32" %}} - everywhere within creation so God is ever present irrespective of space he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4957" display="1:22:37" %}} - can affect anything he desires in the spatial realm therefore God has the ability has always had and always will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4964" display="1:22:44" %}} - have to be anywhere and everywhere local and Universal and this is within creation within the universe uh now this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4971" display="1:22:51" %}} - note is me this isn't directly from the study this is something I wrote I just say a particular note is that this means  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4976" display="1:22:56" %}} - that God sees all he sees everything that happens within creation nobody can sneak anything past God and on that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4983" display="1:23:03" %}} - great day of days on Judgment Day be Before the Throne all will be revealed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4989" display="1:23:09" %}} - um this also means uh as a practical note that it's completely futile to try to run away from God so like Jonah from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4996" display="1:23:16" %}} - the Book of Jonah we will find that no matter where we go God and His purposes for us will always be there too  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5003" display="1:23:23" %}} - so because God is ever presentent in the world uh no matter where we might try to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5009" display="1:23:29" %}} - escape uh to run to hide from the things that God has for us we will never be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5014" display="1:23:34" %}} - able to because God is at all places at all times because he's God so aie do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5020" display="1:23:40" %}} - have any points you want to make um I think maybe this is among the more straightforward of the characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5025" display="1:23:45" %}} - of God that we've gone over here um but interested to hear if you have things to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5031" display="1:23:51" %}} - say um I don't think there is a much more to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5038" display="1:23:58" %}} - say there it's just that God is not limited by space he created it he exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5046" display="1:24:06" %}} - without it or he existed without it until he made it and he absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5051" display="1:24:11" %}} - controls it so he can do whatever he wants with it and he's not limited by it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5058" display="1:24:18" %}} - I think that's um uh I wouldn't say a more correct way to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5064" display="1:24:24" %}} - put it but a more um uh all embracing way to put it uh in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5072" display="1:24:32" %}} - sense that God is not limited by space so one might be thinking in terms of if  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5079" display="1:24:39" %}} - he's everywhere is he in Hell uh but then we talk about the Lake of Fire  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5084" display="1:24:44" %}} - being um uh God casting people away from his presence so what does that mean what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5092" display="1:24:52" %}} - we mean the Bible never uses the word omnipresent but it does say things like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5098" display="1:24:58" %}} - where can I go away from you if I if I make my bed in hell there you are as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5104" display="1:25:04" %}} - well but of course hell in that sense is show the place of the Dead um regardless  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5111" display="1:25:11" %}} - the point is there is no place in the universe in all of creation that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5118" display="1:25:18" %}} - outside of God's reach MH so that's what I would say I I think bringing up the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5123" display="1:25:23" %}} - point of so-called biblical geography um you know ichus has a chart I don't remember exactly which study but of like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5130" display="1:25:30" %}} - the third heaven separated by the universe from like the waters above and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5136" display="1:25:36" %}} - then we have the universe and then um hell and the Lake of Fire you know uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5142" display="1:25:42" %}} - Jesus went into sha like you said the grave um when he descended uh before he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5148" display="1:25:48" %}} - ascended on the third day and that's different than the Lake of Fire where the devil and fallen angels and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5153" display="1:25:53" %}} - unbelievers will go at the end of time um so-called again biblical geography  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5159" display="1:25:59" %}} - here um but regardless like you said the point is God's not limited by space or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5165" display="1:26:05" %}} - spatial concerns and so uh for us practically as human beings well we don't have to worry about any of that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5171" display="1:26:11" %}} - stuff that happens after we die at the moment in how we we in how we live our lives um it is just true that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5177" display="1:26:17" %}} - always before us um and we should actually view this more as a comfort than as a a bad thing is is someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5183" display="1:26:23" %}} - snooping on us because this means that nothing can separate us from God we have this verse I I know Paul wrote maybe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5191" display="1:26:31" %}} - it's Philippians I don't remember like nothing can separate us from the love of God As far as the East is from the West  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5196" display="1:26:36" %}} - that sort of thing uh God is always with us and that should be a supreme Comfort  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5202" display="1:26:42" %}} - to us uh probably more than anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5207" display="1:26:47" %}} - else all right so just to run through the things that we've talked about here in this lesson examining the nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5215" display="1:26:55" %}} - God so we have talked first about God's essential characteristics how he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5220" display="1:27:00" %}} - spiritual Eternal and immeasurable in a spatial sense um and then how that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5226" display="1:27:06" %}} - manifests within creation is him being omnipotent omniscience and omnipresent um and we spent a good bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5233" display="1:27:13" %}} - of our time in the study talking about how God is unique and because no other  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5238" display="1:27:18" %}} - being in all of creation um uh you know or outside of creation right because we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5244" display="1:27:24" %}} - believe there's one God and that God made SpaceTime uh no one is like God no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5250" display="1:27:30" %}} - one in the universe can reasonably be compared to him he's absolutely unique and therefore the person to whom all  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5256" display="1:27:36" %}} - honor is due um and so he transcends the physical Universe um through these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5261" display="1:27:41" %}} - characteristics and within the physical Universe he is supreme within it because  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5267" display="1:27:47" %}} - he is omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent and so this is how we view God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5272" display="1:27:52" %}} - with respect to his infinite nature and if you remember at the beginning of this lesson we had been emphasizing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5279" display="1:27:59" %}} - God's infinite nature illuminates his abilities what things God can do how he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5284" display="1:28:04" %}} - interacts with creation and in the next lesson we are going to pick up talking about God's perfect character and what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5290" display="1:28:10" %}} - that says about his motives

<!-- p="Matthew 5:48" -->

God is perfect in His character, irreproachable and blameless in every possible way.

{{% nt t="ESV" h="300px" p="Matthew 5:48" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 5:48 | NIV11" %}}
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
{{% /scripture-h %}}

{{% scripture-l p="Matthew 5:48 | NIrV" %}}
So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /nt %}}

When firmly grasped, God's perfection---perfection in every way and according to any conceivable true standard---is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His motives*. God's perfect character will never be less than the highest, the best, and the purest that the human mind can comprehend.

#### God is Good {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-good}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-good">God > Is good</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is good (Hebrew *tov*: טוב); it is the antithesis of evil. So how does goodness respond to sinful man? In His goodness, God always has our best interests at heart. Therefore His desire for us to be free from evil and devoted to good is genuine. Even though we are sinful and by nature unworthy of His blessing, in His goodness God has nevertheless found a *gracious* way to redeem us from sin without compromising His character, namely, by giving us the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Holy {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-holy}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-holy">God > Is holy</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is holy (Hebrew *qadosh*: קדוש); it is completely separate from evil. So how does holiness respond to sinful man? In His holiness, God can never compromise His perfect standards for any reason. Therefore His commitment to condemning evil and rewarding good is inviolable. But even though we are sinful and by nature deserving of His judgment, in His holiness God has nevertheless found a *merciful* way to justify us in spite of our sin without violating His character, namely, by judging His Son, Jesus Christ in our place.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Faithful and True {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-faithful-and-true}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-faithful-and-true">God > Is faithful and true</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is faithful and true (Hebrew: *omen*, *emeth*: אמת ,אמון); it is actively opposed to evil. So how do truth and faithfulness respond to sinful man? In His faithfulness and truth, God is entirely reliable and trustworthy in all that He promises to us and does for us. Therefore His veracity and dependability in offering us a way through Jesus Christ to escape the evil of death and embrace the good of eternal life are beyond reproach. So even though we are sinful and by nature objects of His wrath, in His faithfulness and truth God has nevertheless found a way to make *peace* between Himself and us and to remove the enmity between Himself and us, caused by our sins, without corrupting His character, namely, by reconciling us to Himself through the death of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Sovereign {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-sovereign}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-sovereign">God > Is sovereign</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-de-jure-ruler-of-the-universe">God > Is *de jure* ruler of the universe</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Sovereignty comes from God's perfect character. No one else has a legitimate right to rule over the universe. He is the absolute sovereign within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due. Sovereignty thus speaks to God's *moral authority* and *right* to order the universe however He chooses.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His goodness, holiness and truth (essential qualities independent of His creation). From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His love, justice, and life (qualities applying to His creation which correspond to goodness, holiness and truth).

Only God is qualified to be the ultimate judge of the morally accountable creatures He has created, and thus to hold them responsible for their actions. As *de facto* ruler of the universe (through His infinite nature) and *de jure* ruler of the universe (through His perfect character):

<!-- --- -->

##### God possesses the sovereign authority to demonstrate *love* to His sinful creatures out of His own *goodness* {#god-s-perfect-character-god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-demonstrate-love-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-own-goodness}

Not ignoring their sins, as evil suggests He should, but *paying* for them Himself by the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (redemption). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **grace** (Hebrew *chen*: חן; Greek *charis*: χάρις).

<!-- --- -->

##### God possesses the sovereign authority to administer *justice* to His sinful creatures out of His *holiness* {#god-s-perfect-character-god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-administer-justice-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-holiness}

Not abandoning them to their sins, as evil suggests He must, but *forgiving* them Himself on the basis of the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (justification). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **mercy** (Hebrew *chesed*: חסד; Greek *eleos*: ἔλεος).

<!-- --- -->

##### God possesses the sovereign authority to give *life* to His sinful creatures out of His *truth* and *faithfulness* {#god-s-perfect-character-god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-give-life-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-truth-and-faithfulness}

Not allowing them to die in their sins, as evil suggests He will, but *reconciling* them to Himself through the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (reconciliation). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **peace** (Hebrew *shalom*: שלום; Greek *eirene*: εἰρήνη).

<!-- --- -->

##### Summary: God's sovereignty in action {#god-s-perfect-character-summary-god-s-sovereignty-in-action}

| Essential Quality | Manifesting in creation as | Action God takes                  | God's sovereign attitude towards us | Result         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Goodness          | Love                       | Paying for sin                    | Grace                               | Redemption     |
| Holiness          | Justice                    | Forgiving sin                     | Mercy                               | Justification  |
| Truth             | Life                       | Reconciling sinful man to Himself | Peace                               | Reconciliation |

In this---God's full plan for saving sinful man---absolutely everything relies upon the cross, the blood of Jesus Christ. One particularly memorable way I have heard it described is that "God's Mercy and Justice intersect in the cross."

#### God is Love {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-love}

<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-love">God > Is love</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Having love for His creatures, is a natural consequence of God's goodness. Out of the intrinsic goodness of His character, God loves us with a perfect love, desiring to help us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His holiness and justice in the process and forgive our sin without consequence (as evil suggests He should). Therefore God had to find a way to *reach out to us in love* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Grace* is the biblical name for God's policy of lovingly redeeming us from our sins through Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's gracious offer of love and redemption by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

{{< /subjects >}}

Demanding justice for His creatures is a natural consequence of God's holiness. Out of the intrinsic holiness of His character, God must deal with us in perfect justice, righteously condemning us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His goodness and love in the process and abandon us to our sins (as evil suggests He will). For God found a way to *treat us as righteous* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Mercy* is the biblical name for God's policy of justly forgiving us on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's merciful offer of justification by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

##### "How is it just for unbelievers to face infinite, eternal punishment for finite sins?" {#god-s-perfect-character-how-is-it-just-for-unbelievers-to-face-infinite-eternal-punishment-for-finite-sins}

{{% video-only-note %}}

This question's wording presupposes something that is simply not true: that unbelievers face eternal punishment in hell for personal sins they commit in this life.

As we go over in the video, hell exists *not* to punish unbelievers for their sins---as if they could somehow pay for or atone for them---but only because of unbelief ("blasphemy against the Holy Spirit"). That hell is not punishment for sins but the consequence of unbelief---of wanting to spend eternity apart from God---is a rather fundamental point about the nature of hell, but is nonetheless widely misunderstood.

Jesus paid for *all* human sin upon the cross, and, moreover, imperfect human beings are not even worthy sacrifices. That is, we could not pay for our sin even if we wanted to; we are not qualified since we are tainted and marred by sin. Only Christ---the true, blameless Lamb of God---can take away the sins of the world with His blood, and He already did so upon the cross some 2,000 years ago.

If God punished unbelievers for their sins in hell after Christ already took the judgement for said sins, the sins would be judged twice ("double jeopardy")---obviously incompatible with justice. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that falsely believing that human beings are punished for their sins in hell is no less than a rejection of the efficacy of Jesus' payment for all human sin upon the cross (or perhaps the Father's acceptance of Jesus' work). If you believe in unlimited atonement and so-called penal substitutionary atonement (both true things that are clearly taught in scripture), then the purpose (*telos*) of hell cannot be the punishment of human sins. It is simply theologically unworkable.

**To pull us back to the present question:**

The grace of the cross is positively scandalous:  
&emsp;That God would judge His own Son for human sin,  
&emsp;Even for the most gross and reprehensible sins of humanity.

That unbelievers refuse to accept Christ's payment for them is tragic:  
&emsp;That God's love will go unreciprocated,  
&emsp;Despite Him laying down His life for their salvation.

But that unbelievers accuse God of injustice is ironic:  
&emsp;That they scorn the God that loves them so much,  
&emsp;Who has already saved them from their punishment,  
&emsp;By taking it upon His own shoulders.

When unbelievers say it is not just for them to face infinite, eternal punishment for finite sins, they miss the fact that God *already judged Jesus for all their sins upon the cross*, and that people in hell are not there to punish them for their sins, but because they chose unbelief and separation from God. God has, out of His unfathomable grace, spared them the true consequences of their sins---Jesus bore these consequences instead, even for the most vile and unrepentant of unbelievers. Nevertheless, He will let all those creatures who choose of their own will to live apart from Him have their wish. And an eternity apart from God---who is everything good---will be utterly miserable.

The point is that hell is not miserable on account of punishment for sins committed, but miserable on account of separation from God.

{{% sidenote %}}
All of this should make it clear why the idea of "levels of hell" (cf. the ["Nine Circles of Hell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29#Nine_circles_of_Hell) in Dante's [*Inferno*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29)) is so problematic theologically.

Because all people in hell are there for the same reason (unbelief)---not to punish them for their personal sins---there can be no levels of hell.

That people find this unpalatable ("What do you mean Hitler will be no worse off in hell than my 'nice' unbelieving neighbor?!") does not make it any less true. As I have said before, the cross is truly scandalous grace---and what is even more scandalous is that God gives a real offer of salvation to every single human being who has ever lived... even those who---in our opinion---actually deserve a healthy dose of eternal suffering (e.g., those who rape and murder children). *That* is how far God has gone in offering a genuine choice to all mankind.

For people who still balk at this teaching (viewing it as too lenient upon the truly evil), consider Paul. If God made Paul (who---prior to his conversion in Acts 9---was a fierce persecutor of the Early Church) the Apostle to the Gentiles, then when you find fault with God for showing grace to sinners who you think are too evil, are you saying God made a mistake with Paul?

#### God is Life {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-life}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-life">God > Is life</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Saving the lives of His creatures is a natural consequence of God's truth and faithfulness. Out of the intrinsic veracity and trustworthiness of His character, God honors His gracious and merciful promise to restore us to Himself and thereby to eternal life, delivering us from the condemnation of death accruing to us in our sinful state. In doing so, however, He has not failed to resolve the competing demands of His goodness and love on the one hand, with those of His holiness and justice on the other (as evil suggests He must). For God has found a way in accordance with His character to *eliminate the wall of sin and consequent wrath which separates us from Him*, and has done so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf (He died that we might have life). *Peace* is the biblical name for God's life-giving policy of reconciling us to Himself on the basis of the work of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's offer of life, peace, and reconciliation by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right so right now we are going to be picking up with the next lesson in our series here on Bible basics part one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7" display="0:07" %}} - theology proper talking about God's perfect character so in the last lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="12" display="0:12" %}} - we were examining God's infinite nature and what that tells us about his abilities and now we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="17" display="0:17" %}} - picking up examining God's perfect character and how that can help us understand his motives and so here are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="25" display="0:25" %}} - the things that we are going to be going through in this lesson we're going to start out with an introduction of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="30" display="0:30" %}} - it means for God to have perfect character kind of talking a little bit about the word perfect uh the Greek word  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="36" display="0:36" %}} - as it shows up in Matthew 548 then we're going to be talking about how God is good and holy and faithful and true um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="44" display="0:44" %}} - these uh very similar to when we were talking about God's nature being essential characteristics of God that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="49" display="0:49" %}} - then manifest in the universe as love Justice and life um and so in the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="56" display="0:56" %}} - way that we kind of had the section in the last lesson uh talking about how God is unique serving as a bridge between  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="63" display="1:03" %}} - the essential characteristics of God and how they manifest in creation we're going to have that same sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="68" display="1:08" %}} - structure here with this section on how God is Sovereign um in fact this is even a bit more fleshed out than the God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="75" display="1:15" %}} - unique section from the last one and so you'll see what I mean when we get there this will probably be one of the larger  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - subsections in our examination of things in this study talking about um how God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="87" display="1:27" %}} - goodness Holiness and faithfulness and Truth manifest in terms of Love Justice and life and what that means in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="93" display="1:33" %}} - God's Sovereign control of all creation so these are the things that we are going to be talking about here in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="102" display="1:42" %}} - lesson all right so the first thing that we are going to be doing here to introduce the topic of this lesson is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="109" display="1:49" %}} - talking about God's perfect character which is irreplaceable and blameless and every way and so this is the verse here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="117" display="1:57" %}} - uh that we pull up uh to kind of introduce the topic Matthew 5: 48 says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="123" display="2:03" %}} - that you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="128" display="2:08" %}} - vocabulary here is the Greek word toos um so this is an adjective um and a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="134" display="2:14" %}} - little bit more than an English perhaps this word has the sense of completion of fullness of lacking nothing and so when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="141" display="2:21" %}} - we think of perfect in English um I don't know if we necessarily have all those same connotations that go along  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="147" display="2:27" %}} - with it but toos in Greek has this idea of something that has been uh fully  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="153" display="2:33" %}} - accomplished something that has been done realized it's at its end so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="158" display="2:38" %}} - speak it is brought to completion and that is the quotative sense of this of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="163" display="2:43" %}} - this word meaning perfect here in Greek and so that is what God is um so when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="169" display="2:49" %}} - grasped God's Perfection is perfection in every way and according to any conceivable true standard um and as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="176" display="2:56" %}} - say this is going to help us understand God's motives um as a moral agent God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="182" display="3:02" %}} - perfect character will never be less than the highest the best and the purest that the human mind can comprehend um to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="188" display="3:08" %}} - the nth degree and so just as God's nature is infinite so too is his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="193" display="3:13" %}} - character uh unimpeachable he is perfect in the superlative sense of every  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="199" display="3:19" %}} - positive moral characteristic and that is what we are going to be examining as we move forward uh talking about some of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="206" display="3:26" %}} - his characteristics of of goodness uh wow I'm forgetting them off the top of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="212" display="3:32" %}} - my head of goodness and then his Justice faithfulness and Truth moving into the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="217" display="3:37" %}} - applied characteristics as well so a do you have anything you want to say just about the idea of perfection in general  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="224" display="3:44" %}} - as it applies to God um I would say uh as a sort of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="232" display="3:52" %}} - contextualization uh of of this discussion so far it is this um that uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="240" display="4:00" %}} - uh in in discussing theology we're asking the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="245" display="4:05" %}} - question why should we trust  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="250" display="4:10" %}} - God that is um that is that is a okay let me see if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="257" display="4:17" %}} - I can get into it just a little bit hopefully you won't see the minute um the subject of the Bible is really God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="264" display="4:24" %}} - and his plan which of course is centered around the Lord Jesus Christ so so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="271" display="4:31" %}} - what we are seeking to do is to is to get to know why we we are right to place  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="279" display="4:39" %}} - our trust in God at least the one that's revealed in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="284" display="4:44" %}} - Bible and why that one is the right God because just like Paul says there are gods and Lords many but we know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="292" display="4:52" %}} - there is only one God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ so when we are looking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="300" display="5:00" %}} - at um theology the study of God we're looking at who first of all what is he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="307" display="5:07" %}} - and in fact those two components what is he and who is he are really um two parts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="316" display="5:16" %}} - of one whole what is a thing made of and what does a thing do so what is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="323" display="5:23" %}} - nature what what is he at his core and what does he do as a rule these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="333" display="5:33" %}} - are the two things that tell us what a thing is and who who a person is so when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="340" display="5:40" %}} - we studied God is unique we were learning how he is deity how he is that which is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="350" display="5:50" %}} - thing that separate from everything else that exists now when we're looking at his character we're coming to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="357" display="5:57" %}} - see this is also why he does different things than every  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="363" display="6:03" %}} - everything else that exists so we discovering God as a person in his own  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="370" display="6:10" %}} - right and his Perfection is a necessary part of that discussion because it tells  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="375" display="6:15" %}} - us this is why we can trust him we know his abilities now we know his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="385" display="6:25" %}} - character so that's um that's what I would say about that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="390" display="6:30" %}} - it's a it's it's a question of keeping our eyes on what on what the context is what we're trying to uh um get to know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="399" display="6:39" %}} - so that we are confirmed in trusting the Lord as we come to discover what his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="406" display="6:46" %}} - plan is and are plac in that plan right and I think that's why the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="411" display="6:51" %}} - focus on this section um as the study mentions is Illuminating God's motives  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="417" display="6:57" %}} - why does God operate in the way which he does and what is the reason behind it um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="423" display="7:03" %}} - you know what are his plans as it regards us as moral creatures in the universe um so again not so much what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="431" display="7:11" %}} - can he do because as we've established God can do anything within material creation but why God does the things he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="439" display="7:19" %}} - does especially as we'll see in coming slides here as we go through this lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="445" display="7:25" %}} - especially as it relates to redeeming mankind um God's relationship to us as Humanity the ways in which he has saved  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="452" display="7:32" %}} - us from the just consequences of our sins through the sacrifice of his son on the cross um that is what we get at it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="460" display="7:40" %}} - when we talk about well why does God do what he does um what is his plan for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="465" display="7:45" %}} - Redemptive human history of mankind um so we will elaborate on all of this more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="471" display="7:51" %}} - as we go but for the first several slides we will be focusing on um God's essential characteristics of goodness  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="478" display="7:58" %}} - holy Hess and faithfulness and truth so I misspoke early it was Holiness not justice justice is the applied one but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="484" display="8:04" %}} - that is where we will pick up to begin this discussion in this lesson all right so we had a question here about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="492" display="8:12" %}} - basically why does this verse in Matthew Chapter 5 tell us to be perfect like god  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="497" display="8:17" %}} - is perfect if we have absolutely no ability to live up to that standard um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="503" display="8:23" %}} - we cannot be perfect in the same way that God is right we said God is unique in his abilities he's also unique in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="510" display="8:30" %}} - moral perfection uh so I always view this as a standard um so we are supposed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="516" display="8:36" %}} - to be dead to sin as Christians that doesn't mean that we are completely free from the grip of sin um so when we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="524" display="8:44" %}} - uh when the Bible says that we are to be perfect this is what our goal should be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="530" display="8:50" %}} - um we shouldn't make excuses for oursel we should not try to draw a line in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="535" display="8:55" %}} - sand and say uh you know no further God this is as far as I will go this is as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="540" display="9:00" %}} - much as I'm willing to sacrifice but we need to press forward towards the standard that is complete Perfection  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="546" display="9:06" %}} - because that is what God is um that is what we should strive to be um so um I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="554" display="9:14" %}} - don't see a contradiction inherently in that being the standard that's set for us even though we'll never meet it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="560" display="9:20" %}} - because God knows that that's why he sent his only son to die for us to make up that distance between us um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="567" display="9:27" %}} - distance that just to be clear is there inherently we could not even if we were  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="572" display="9:32" %}} - perfect which no human being can be because of the sin nature um uh this gets into a false Doctrine called  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="579" display="9:39" %}} - pelagianism uh even one of us you know were we to quote unquote live a perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="584" display="9:44" %}} - life which is impossible we still have this distance between us and God a do you want to uh clarify this verse at all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="593" display="9:53" %}} - if you were talking you muted can you hear me yeah I can hear you now  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="600" display="10:00" %}} - okay um I don't know if if it's just a network issues on my end you keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="607" display="10:07" %}} - breaking up um but if you can hear me let me say this like you said and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="614" display="10:14" %}} - another way that Prof Robert actually puts this matter of Matthew 5:48 is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="621" display="10:21" %}} - um it's a job description so it's like this is what you should be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="626" display="10:26" %}} - doing and if you're not doing it right then you try to do it better you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="631" display="10:31" %}} - it's your job description it it doesn't mean that we could possibly be that perfect uh Perfection is a gift that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="639" display="10:39" %}} - Lord is going to give to us but our responsibility is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="646" display="10:46" %}} - to push toward it so it's like working out just how the scripture say work out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="651" display="10:51" %}} - your salvation with fear and trembling so we are we we we are like him in in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="659" display="10:59" %}} - the sense since we have been born again we have the seed of God in us we are his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="668" display="11:08" %}} - children carrying his DNA so to speak so we should act like it is what this place  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="674" display="11:14" %}} - is saying so we're not supposed to um think in terms of first of all that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="680" display="11:20" %}} - can be be that perfect by our efforts no that's not what it's saying at all and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="687" display="11:27" %}} - second of all that um we are somehow because there are people who hold that view too we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="694" display="11:34" %}} - perfect simply because we are children of God no we will be made perfect we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="700" display="11:40" %}} - looking forward to that but the lord requires us to live like people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="707" display="11:47" %}} - aiming to be perfect so um in other words as long as we are not perfect we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="714" display="11:54" %}} - have work to do that's it that's the way we should be thinking about our lives um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="719" display="11:59" %}} - then regarding Noah exactly as uh Lisa said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="728" display="12:08" %}} - um that was that was speaking to his Humanity he was not an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="735" display="12:15" %}} - Neel he was perfect a perfect human being like a true human being not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="741" display="12:21" %}} - tainted in any way by the uh manipulations and uh what not of um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="750" display="12:30" %}} - uh the rebel Angels at the time that's what that was speaking to it wasn't speaking to his character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="757" display="12:37" %}} - or well yeah it wasn't speaking to his character where it spoke to his character was where it said that um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="763" display="12:43" %}} - was upright or something of that sort I don't remember the exact phrase used um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="770" display="12:50" %}} - so uh that was speaking to his Humanity we have evidence of the fact that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="776" display="12:56" %}} - certainly was not perfect in character with the wine thing you know of course  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="781" display="13:01" %}} - not that he was a drunk but then we should remember that Perfection is not that you do everything right when you're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="787" display="13:07" %}} - cognizant of it it is that even when you're not cognizant of it you're doing the right thing so you can't be wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="796" display="13:16" %}} - you can't do the wrong thing unconscious of that the Perfection of Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - is how that was the Perfection of God is like is how that was so the fact that you didn't know that something was wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="808" display="13:28" %}} - does not absolve you of guilt so likewise the fact that he did not know that he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="816" display="13:36" %}} - about to get drunk when he planted a vineard and you know made juice from it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="822" display="13:42" %}} - and and had the juice and didn't know it was going to do all of that to him his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="828" display="13:48" %}} - only proof that he was just like us like every other human being flawed in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="835" display="13:55" %}} - character because he was flawed in his knowledge so um I just it wasn't speaking this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="841" display="14:01" %}} - character not that we want to get too caught up in the grammar and things this is the Hebrew here my Hebrew is a lot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="847" display="14:07" %}} - rer than my Greek is um I did have a year of it in college but my Greek was much better because I had four years of that um so we have a prepositional  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="854" display="14:14" %}} - phrase here um this is this word here in Hebrew Hebrew is read right to left of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="859" display="14:19" %}} - course so uh this is a masculine plural form uh that means over here if you want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="864" display="14:24" %}} - to look at the Lexicon uh I think you could get away translating either of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="870" display="14:30" %}} - like sort of times he was a man perfect in his times or his Generations um that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="876" display="14:36" %}} - KJV is quite literal um over here we see that KJV and KJV translate this as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="882" display="14:42" %}} - perfect in his generations and like aie has been clarifying this is with regards  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="887" display="14:47" %}} - to the fact that he was uh not of one of the Bloodlines of the Nephilim um he had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="895" display="14:55" %}} - uh he and his forefathers you know to be fair it's not just him had kept themselves uh set apart and pure in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="903" display="15:03" %}} - corruption that was racing through the world at his time and that is more or less what we should take this uh to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - what the text is getting at blameless or perfect in his Generations is getting at that sense not that Noah was an immoral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="918" display="15:18" %}} - person but that it wasn't drawing some sort of distinction between his perfect morality versus US normal humans but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="925" display="15:25" %}} - that it was specifically getting towards that um I don't know if that helps at all or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - just makes it more confusing but uh anything to add there Audi or is that how we can close off these questions oh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="939" display="15:39" %}} - no I think uh that's that's the wrap on that I think we can move on to the discussion now okay great well we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="946" display="15:46" %}} - pick up then um moving on towards those characteristics like we said we're gonna do the first time picking up with God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="956" display="15:56" %}} - good so on the first first of these characteristics of God describing his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="961" display="16:01" %}} - perfect character we're going to be talking about how God is good now before I pick up here I'm going to note that uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="968" display="16:08" %}} - Dr lugan buil in the study since these paragraphs are coming out of the study has a few key vocabulary words that will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - keep coming back up so we talked about goodness Holiness faithful and true  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="979" display="16:19" %}} - right those are essential characteristics of God part of his perfect character that will come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="984" display="16:24" %}} - manifest in creation um as love Justice and let me see love Justice and life um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - and alongside those things we know that um the kind of mindset that God has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1000" display="16:40" %}} - towards us corresponding to his goodness is Grace corresponding to his Justice is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1006" display="16:46" %}} - Mercy and corresponding to his life the life that he has through reconcil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1011" display="16:51" %}} - reconciling us to him is peace and so uh before we get too far ahead of ourselves  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1017" display="16:57" %}} - I do have a table uh that we'll get through partway through this lesson that kind of maps all this out to kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1022" display="17:02" %}} - help keep it straight but you'll notice that certain words here are kind of bolded or sorry uh italicized uh in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1029" display="17:09" %}} - text of these and this again is done so on the study itself uh you know I just made the slides pulling from the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1035" display="17:15" %}} - and that's because Dr Lil is trying to get us to follow these patterns um of how these words relate to each other uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1042" display="17:22" %}} - as as to how they relate towards uh God's character and his uh sort of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1049" display="17:29" %}} - um attitude towards us as sinful humanity and so uh starting out here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - I know that was a bit of a a rambly introduction uh here specifically we're talking about how God is good and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1061" display="17:41" %}} - Hebrew word for good is Tove here Tove and it is the antithesis of evil um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1067" display="17:47" %}} - I'm GNA go ahead and just read this paragraph um uh this part of the study I will say has almost a very poetic bent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1073" display="17:53" %}} - to it I think part of that is just Dr Lille has taken care to arrange the paragraph  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1079" display="17:59" %}} - so such that they're very parallel to each other um so they they share a similar sentence structure in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1085" display="18:05" %}} - how he organizes the terms and the concepts and you'll certainly see that when we get to uh the summary section of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1091" display="18:11" %}} - this there's a uh a grouping of how he he words it that really comes off very poetic um but in these paragraphs even  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1098" display="18:18" %}} - here you'll get this sense of The Wider scale behind the characteristics of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1104" display="18:24" %}} - that we're talking about um and this is why I kind of made the point that we're specifically looking at God's character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1110" display="18:30" %}} - to help illuminate why he takes the actions he does with respect to us as Humanity um God's attitude towards us as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1116" display="18:36" %}} - sinful man um so I'm gonna go ahead and I will probably just read these uh as the way as we go through again uh keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1123" display="18:43" %}} - in mind that the italicized words we will link those back up as important vocabulary here um as we make sense of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1131" display="18:51" %}} - the sovereignty of God and how he uh acts in the universe but going to go ahead and read this paragraph here so so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1138" display="18:58" %}} - it says so how does goodness respond to sinful man in his goodness God always  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1144" display="19:04" %}} - has our best interests his heart therefore his desire for us to be free from Evil and devoted to good is genuine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1152" display="19:12" %}} - even though we are sinful and by Nature Unworthy of his Blessing in his goodness God has nevertheless found a gracious  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1158" display="19:18" %}} - way to redeem us from sin without compromising his character namely by giving us the gift of his son Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1166" display="19:26" %}} - Christ now as we go and we look at the other characteristics of God you'll keep seeing uh kind of this closing remark  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1174" display="19:34" %}} - come up over and over again God has resolved all of the sort of uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1182" display="19:42" %}} - manifestations of his character what his character demands of him in terms of love and Justice uh through the cross of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1188" display="19:48" %}} - Jesus Christ it was the move that the devil never saw coming uh the the move  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1193" display="19:53" %}} - that completely won the game in a victory that cannot be turned back so Jesus Christ defeated sin and death once  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1200" display="20:00" %}} - for all on the cross I mean it is the central turning point of human history where God won the battle not that there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1207" display="20:07" %}} - was any chance that he would ever lose but it was the action that God took that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1213" display="20:13" %}} - completely changed everything uh for his relationship with humankind and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1219" display="20:19" %}} - is how uh you know for this slide specifically that is how we are seeing God's goodness uh this action that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1226" display="20:26" %}} - took on our behalf a gracious way to redeem us but as you'll see um as I've kind of been harping on here this will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1232" display="20:32" %}} - come up over and over again the cross is the action uh through which we can see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1237" display="20:37" %}} - God's character working in his plan to redeem Humanity so opening this discussion aie  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1244" display="20:44" %}} - do you have more things you want to say on the goodness of God I I just thought of uh James one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1252" display="20:52" %}} - where it said God is light and um uh there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1259" display="20:59" %}} - no not there is no shadow of turning with him I think there's um there's no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1264" display="21:04" %}} - Darkness at all in him so I think that uh that is one of the things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1270" display="21:10" %}} - Professor Robert is trying is is looking to get at with that section um so I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - will say also that um yeah let me see if if I will find that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1283" display="21:23" %}} - is I think it's earlier in the chapter yes okay there there is no shifting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1290" display="21:30" %}} - Shadow mhm okay with him there is no shifting Shadow but there's another place where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1295" display="21:35" %}} - it says God is light and uh you might be thinking of John the Gospel of John is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1301" display="21:41" %}} - that possible oh yeah you're right first John one right or first  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1307" display="21:47" %}} - John John the Gospel of John chapter one talks about how the light came into the world I think I know what you're talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1312" display="21:52" %}} - about have to I'll have to look for the passage um I was thinking it was James chapter one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1319" display="21:59" %}} - um God is light and uh there is no Darkness at all in him is first John it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1325" display="22:05" %}} - is first John one picking up at verse five yeah yeah correct so in him there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1331" display="22:11" %}} - is no Darkness at all so I think I see where Professor Robert is going or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1337" display="22:17" %}} - looking to you know get to with uh what he's saying there but every time that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1346" display="22:26" %}} - I've thought of discussing um the character of God I find  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1351" display="22:31" %}} - myself uh wanting to speak from the perspective that God is love and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1357" display="22:37" %}} - unfolding the characteristics of love you know um first uh 1 Corinthians 13  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1364" display="22:44" %}} - where it says Love Is This Love is that and all of that because I I feel like um in exploring  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1371" display="22:51" %}} - that we will come to probably when I say Fuller appreciation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1378" display="22:58" %}} - of what Professor Robert is trying to say there uh I I think um Lisa captured  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - it correctly when she said that um theology is a bit dense because it it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1390" display="23:10" %}} - packs so much into so uh little really and if you come at God's character from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1399" display="23:19" %}} - from the fact that he is love a lot of things will begin get to unfold I will say we will we will get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1405" display="23:25" %}} - there um that is one of the the applied goodness in creation um yeah it is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1411" display="23:31" %}} - slide in this lesson but uh it is five or six in the future at this point yeah I the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1419" display="23:39" %}} - uh how he structured it basically is what I would change is what I'm saying I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1425" display="23:45" %}} - find myself wanting to do that but I've not explored it as fully as I want to yet suffice to say that when he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1432" display="23:52" %}} - talking about God's goodness and talking about the antithesis the fact that it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1437" display="23:57" %}} - the antithesis of evil um this this uh uh reading in 1 John 1 um is very very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1448" display="24:08" %}} - much what it reminds me of the idea that we're still we're still saying this that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1455" display="24:15" %}} - God is different than um Satan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1461" display="24:21" %}} - than I wouldn't say just the universe because he made the universe to be good and then it got corrupted because of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1467" display="24:27" %}} - reion of Satan and uh all other creatures that agreed to um join him in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1473" display="24:33" %}} - his Rebellion but the idea here is God is not just good in that um he he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1485" display="24:45" %}} - is not evil he is good in the sense that he cannot be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1491" display="24:51" %}} - evil that he is good so that you define good by him and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1500" display="25:00" %}} - everything that is not him everything that does not derive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1505" display="25:05" %}} - from him is evil so something of that sort is what we're looking at when when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1511" display="25:11" %}} - when um Professor Robert matches good and evil in this way that he actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1517" display="25:17" %}} - says God God is good and he says it is that is the antithesis of evil he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1524" display="25:24" %}} - saying that there is no way to find evil in God which is something that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1529" display="25:29" %}} - speaking to the satanic Rebellion when Satan imputed God's character with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1536" display="25:36" %}} - accusations he made and he did the same thing with Adam and Eve when he said you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1542" display="25:42" %}} - will not surely die God is just trying to prevent you from becoming like him he's trying to keep something from you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1549" display="25:49" %}} - he wants it all for himself so to speak now this is essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1556" display="25:56" %}} - attacking God's character and saying it is not what it is but God cannot be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1562" display="26:02" %}} - corrupted at all in any way he it's impossible to corrupt him is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1568" display="26:08" %}} - the idea of his being the antithesis of evil it is not possible at any point to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1575" display="26:15" %}} - find evil in God so when when that question has arisen in in apologetics um is something  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1583" display="26:23" %}} - good because God decreed it or did God decree something because it is good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1588" display="26:28" %}} - the answer to that really is if God says it or if God does it then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1596" display="26:36" %}} - it is good that's it yeah well because this to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1601" display="26:41" %}} - me he is all good I I think it's another one of those things where we what Audi  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1607" display="26:47" %}} - is is getting into is one of those apologetics questions um I is this not ether froze dilemma is that what it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1614" display="26:54" %}} - called um I think you hard named youth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1619" display="26:59" %}} - fro am I right or right yeah look at that um well we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1627" display="27:07" %}} - don't need to get into this I I've heard this before um you know is uh whatever um it looks like it came  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1635" display="27:15" %}} - up initially with Socrates or you know Socrates via Plato um but the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1640" display="27:20" %}} - point is uh God is UN Alena good right good by definition uh the metric upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1647" display="27:27" %}} - which evil is defined comes through God's goodness um so for us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1653" display="27:33" %}} - practice uh this is another one of those things where uh sometimes we might be tempted to put God in a box again and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1660" display="27:40" %}} - say well how can we say God is good when there is suffering in the world or given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1666" display="27:46" %}} - this this kind of very obviously horrific thing on the face of it well how can we have a good loving God you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1673" display="27:53" %}} - know and we'll get into this more as we unpack uh other aspects of God's charactera character but how can we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1679" display="27:59" %}} - believe that if this happens um that is a very common doubt um that people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1686" display="28:06" %}} - when it comes to the character of God um I don't see the purpose in this suffering or in this evil in the world  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1693" display="28:13" %}} - um and so how can we say God is good you know that is the sort of challenge that comes up but it it kind of we are once  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1701" display="28:21" %}} - again when we do that we aren't appreciating how big God is and how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1706" display="28:26" %}} - small our own perspective is in this um you know it's sort of like uh a a child  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1711" display="28:31" %}} - will say that um you know letting them eat lots of candy is good right it makes them happy but we know as adults that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1719" display="28:39" %}} - the thing that comes after eating an entire bag full of candies and upset stomach um that is the sort of shift in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1726" display="28:46" %}} - perspective that I'm getting at here um so we could very easily get off topic of talking about a whole bunch of aspects  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1733" display="28:53" %}} - of of all of this but you know I think as we go we will continue to clarify more about some of the aspects of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1740" display="29:00" %}} - character um and how we have to keep that perspective always in our heads about how much bigger God is than our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - own perspective um and some of that just involves the faith on our part to trust  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1752" display="29:12" %}} - that even at the times when we don't understand our default position needs to be to trust in God's character rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1759" display="29:19" %}} - than doubting it or feeling that it can't possibly be so um because no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1765" display="29:25" %}} - matter what sometimes we may be pressured to feel by our emotions leading us astray we need to have that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1771" display="29:31" %}} - sure confidence that God's character is perfect uh the Bible tells us so right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1776" display="29:36" %}} - right here Matthew 548 what we talked about and if the Bible tells us that then we need to trust that even when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1782" display="29:42" %}} - have a hard time understanding it um that could be a tricky lesson for us but that is certainly the standard to which we are called so I think that's where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1790" display="29:50" %}} - we'll wrap our initial discussion here on God being good and we will pick up next with God being holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1800" display="30:00" %}} - all right so the next aspect of God's perfect character that we are going to be discussing is God's holiness and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - just as before Dr Lugo gives us the Hebrew word here uh Holiness here is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1813" display="30:13" %}} - kados um again Hebrew readed right to left um so when we say God is Holy he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1819" display="30:19" %}} - completely separate from Evil he set apart so what this Hebrew word means the Greek word equivalent is hos I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1827" display="30:27" %}} - have that up on the oops I don't have that up on the screen here but uh equivalent word in Greek as well and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1833" display="30:33" %}} - holiness means being completely set apart and separate from Evil so again I said I was going to be reading these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1838" display="30:38" %}} - paragraphs getting that kind of poetic tilt to it and again notice the italicized word here here being merciful  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1845" display="30:45" %}} - and that's what corresponds to God's holiness So reading this paragraph we say so how does holiness respond to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1852" display="30:52" %}} - sinful man in his Holiness God can never compromise his perfect standard for any  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1857" display="30:57" %}} - reason therefore his commitment to condemning evil and rewarding good is inviolable but even though we are sinful  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1864" display="31:04" %}} - and by Nature deserving of his judgment in his Holiness God has nevertheless found a merciful way to justify us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1871" display="31:11" %}} - spite of our sin without violating his character namely by judging his son Jesus Christ in our place so I said that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1880" display="31:20" %}} - this uh ending refrain was going to come up time and again that the solution to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1885" display="31:25" %}} - all of these apparent contradictions how God relates to sinful man are solved uh through the cross through his Judgment  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1892" display="31:32" %}} - of his son Jesus Christ to take the place uh for the uh payment of our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1898" display="31:38" %}} - um and so this uh with regards to his Holiness God could not let sin go unpunished but in his Mercy Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1906" display="31:46" %}} - stood in the gap between us and he took the punishment on our behalf on that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1912" display="31:52" %}} - Mercy uh satisfying the Holiness that's part of God's character um also his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1918" display="31:58" %}} - goodness um his love for us so um do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1923" display="32:03" %}} - have thoughts you want to say on Holiness yeah sure  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1928" display="32:08" %}} - um so when I don't know if anyone else has thought about this but the feeling I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1935" display="32:15" %}} - had um the first time that I was going through Bible basics and I came to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1941" display="32:21" %}} - is good and then God is Holy was I'm not sure I see the difference I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1947" display="32:27" %}} - God is good God is Holy and then you go on to say first of all the the statement  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1954" display="32:34" %}} - he made with God is good is um it is the God's character is good it is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1960" display="32:40" %}} - antithesis of evil and then he says God's character is Holy it is completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1967" display="32:47" %}} - separate from Evil so it's like I mean didn't you just say the same thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1973" display="32:53" %}} - in two different ways right so why why do you need to talk about God's holiness  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1978" display="32:58" %}} - as a separate thing from God's goodness in the first instance we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1983" display="33:03" %}} - talking about how nothing that is evil comes from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1990" display="33:10" %}} - at all like this evil by by very by by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1996" display="33:16" %}} - its very definition is an opposition to God so God cannot do evil there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2003" display="33:23" %}} - possibility that if anything is evil it has its roots or origins in God this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2009" display="33:29" %}} - very important in our walk with the Lord because I mean when you get to a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2016" display="33:36" %}} - certain stage and not too far into your walk with the Lord you do you do start to see that it makes no sense to ascribe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2024" display="33:44" %}} - certain things to the Lord because they simply can't be him he simply can't be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2030" display="33:50" %}} - like that um but Holiness is that there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2037" display="33:57" %}} - subtle difference here and the subtle difference is not just that nothing evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2042" display="34:02" %}} - can come from the Lord but that if it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2050" display="34:10" %}} - evil it has nothing to do with God so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2055" display="34:15" %}} - it's not just that it does not come from him but he is utterly separated from it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2062" display="34:22" %}} - and the separation is not is not a small one it's a wide  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2068" display="34:28" %}} - golf so when you see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2073" display="34:33" %}} - goodness or something that looks good but does not derive from God and it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2080" display="34:40" %}} - actually evil the better you know the Lord the easier it is for you to tell that that thing is not it has nothing to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2087" display="34:47" %}} - do with god so let's talk about that in job it says that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2093" display="34:53" %}} - he he found fault with his holy ones now that's a very big  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2101" display="35:01" %}} - statement to make because Satan was so smart that it felt like his evil looked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2107" display="35:07" %}} - like good he could get away with what he was doing because God couldn't condemn it but God still found fault with it and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2115" display="35:15" %}} - a lot of times in our own minds this is how sin actually seduces us we come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2121" display="35:21" %}} - think that we can we can understand a certain thing as being well not so bad  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2127" display="35:27" %}} - or well even good it's we don't have a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2134" display="35:34" %}} - problem as we are right now people who have been training in the scriptures for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2140" display="35:40" %}} - so long now in in Discerning that certain things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2147" display="35:47" %}} - are just not God we don't have a problem Discerning  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2153" display="35:53" %}} - that but look at the world around us there are those who are you might think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2160" display="36:00" %}} - of them as being mischievous when they say certain  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2166" display="36:06" %}} - things but you you you might not actually see that they really do believe the things they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2172" display="36:12" %}} - saying some people really do believe that one of the most popular  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2178" display="36:18" %}} - issues in the world today the LGBT thing is approved by God and they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2184" display="36:24" %}} - intricate involved arguments to persuade themselves and other people that this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2191" display="36:31" %}} - not really separate from God's holy standard they they find it in consonance  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2198" display="36:38" %}} - with God himself and yet there's a wide Gulf that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2204" display="36:44" %}} - cannot be bridged between where they stand and where God is and the reason they can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2212" display="36:52" %}} - see that is because they don't know God's character to be holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2218" display="36:58" %}} - okay so that's one aspect of it that there is this massive separation between God and all that is evil the other thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2225" display="37:05" %}} - about it too is because God is Holy there is no reconciliation between God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2232" display="37:12" %}} - and all that is evil so as we said with his goodness everything that is evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2237" display="37:17" %}} - stands in opposition to who God is and what God is about everything that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2242" display="37:22" %}} - does stands in opposition to all that is evil now we see that everything that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2249" display="37:29" %}} - does or is about is separate like it you cannot find it in any agreement with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2256" display="37:36" %}} - things that are evil okay now this also means that every time there is evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2264" display="37:44" %}} - being done it there is a condemnation already a Divine condemnation on that thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2272" display="37:52" %}} - there is no possibility of reconciling it to God this is also why um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2278" display="37:58" %}} - those well in Psalm it actually says evil shall not dwell with God there is no possibility of God coexisting with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2286" display="38:06" %}} - that so that might raise a question for us which we have actually touched on uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2292" display="38:12" %}} - in our discussions at some point how then does God interact with the world filled as it is with evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2300" display="38:20" %}} - there's such a separation between him and evil that there cannot be any  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2306" display="38:26" %}} - reconciliation right up to the point that even before evil existed there was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2312" display="38:32" %}} - something there was a need for a cherub that covered a cherub that made a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2318" display="38:38" %}} - difference between who God is and what God is about and all that is not what God is about and even after the fall  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2326" display="38:46" %}} - after Satan's rebellion and after uh well after after Satan's Rebellion after  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2332" display="38:52" %}} - man's fall we still see that there was a cherub or cherubim now that guarded the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2339" display="38:59" %}} - way to God and said essentially now that you are stained you cannot come close to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2344" display="39:04" %}} - me so how then is God operating in an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2349" display="39:09" %}} - evil world today so this this is a question we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2356" display="39:16" %}} - explore a little bit but we get we get a clue in what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2361" display="39:21" %}} - um Roberts says when he says in his Holiness God has nevertheless found a merciful way to justify us now if you go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2369" display="39:29" %}} - to First John again chapter one it says that he that he he is faithful and just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2375" display="39:35" %}} - to forgive us so there is Justice a righteousness a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2382" display="39:42" %}} - goodness in the Lord actually forgiving Sinners when remember again there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - reconciliation between God and anything that is evil so now we are getting a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2394" display="39:54" %}} - hint at a mass mive miracle in God that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2399" display="39:59" %}} - makes it possible for him to forgive sin us so again I will say that the way that Professor Robert actually structure this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2405" display="40:05" %}} - discussion of theology is to make this point of the miracle of Jesus Christ for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2411" display="40:11" %}} - us I would structure it differently but I but the point here is he's he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2416" display="40:16" %}} - driving at telling us Jesus is the point and Jesus is the miracle that would make  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2422" display="40:22" %}} - it possible for a God who is utterly holy completely sep from everything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2427" display="40:27" %}} - is evil to reconcile Sinners to himself that's the miracle sure I mean I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2434" display="40:34" %}} - I definitely pointed that out that is the theme that is continually cycled back to in how he structures these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2441" display="40:41" %}} - statements on God's character it's all about turning us back to see how the cross is the thing that reconciles all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2448" display="40:48" %}} - these aspects of God's character now I will say uh we probably don't need to spend too much more time talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2454" display="40:54" %}} - how can a holy God dwell among uh you know sin because we definitely spent time talking about that with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2460" display="41:00" %}} - regards to light and Glory that was a couple uh a couple lessons back at this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2465" display="41:05" %}} - point but um one other thing to mention AI kind of brought up this idea of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2470" display="41:10" %}} - well if God is the antithesis of evil and we say his Holiness means he's completely separate from Evil what's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2476" display="41:16" %}} - distinction um at risk of oversimplifying uh I think it would go something like God cannot sin because he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2483" display="41:23" %}} - is good but God cannot tolerate sin because he is Holy um so not so much his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2490" display="41:30" %}} - sin but the sin of other beings um Holiness has an intolerance for the sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2496" display="41:36" %}} - the presence of sin in a way that simply not sinning oneself is somewhat different um so that's how I view God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2503" display="41:43" %}} - holiness bril and that's also what ties us all the way back to like Audi said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2509" display="41:49" %}} - the cross of Jesus Christ being a miracle right how we reconcile God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2514" display="41:54" %}} - holiness with sinful creatures is nothing short of miraculous it is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2519" display="41:59" %}} - very thing that saves us uh that gives us our life here in the world is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2525" display="42:05" %}} - God condemned Jesus Christ in our place and we need to view that and again I certainly there are you know there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2531" display="42:11" %}} - almost an infinite uh degree of ways to structure things to go about talking about who God is what his character is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2538" display="42:18" %}} - but like Audi said the way in which this particular structure is structured this particular study is structured is trying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2545" display="42:25" %}} - to draw emphasis that uh the cross of Jesus Christ is what reconciles these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2551" display="42:31" %}} - aspects of God's character um so uh I don't have too much more to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2556" display="42:36" %}} - I think we have covered this one well um that is what makes Holiness um you know a distinct characteristic of God and I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2563" display="42:43" %}} - would say almost arguably the characteristic of God that poses the greatest challenge to us as sinful human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2569" display="42:49" %}} - beings right um you know yeah we we we have this huge Gulf like you've been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2575" display="42:55" %}} - saying between between us and God um this is the aspect of God's character that challenges our right to Salvation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2583" display="43:03" %}} - um and that's why the cross of Jesus Christ is such blessed good news for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2589" display="43:09" %}} - um that God is the one who bridged that Gulf through his son yeah all right well I think that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2596" display="43:16" %}} - where we will wrap on Holiness and next we will be picking up with how God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2601" display="43:21" %}} - faithful and true all right so picking up with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2608" display="43:28" %}} - next aspect of God's character God being faithful and true so we have two Hebrew  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2614" display="43:34" %}} - words here remember Hebrews right to left but this here is Omen and Emet  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2619" display="43:39" %}} - these are other fundamental aspects of God's character so God's character is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2625" display="43:45" %}} - faithful and true it is actively opposed to evil um so God cannot sin God cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - tolerate sin God actively opposes sin and evil um God being faithful and true  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - uh you know truth and lies um aie brought this up when uh he he brought up first John chapter 1 talking about light  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2644" display="44:04" %}} - and darkness uh good and evil light and darkness truth and lies these are all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2650" display="44:10" %}} - binary distinctions and God is uh good and light and Truth as opposed to evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2656" display="44:16" %}} - and darkness and lies um and so all of these are just ways in which we can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2662" display="44:22" %}} - conceptualize God's character and his relationship to the world so uh just as for the last two going to go ahead and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2668" display="44:28" %}} - read this paragraph and note again how it always turns back to thinking in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2673" display="44:33" %}} - terms of Jesus Christ and the cross as the solution to reconciling us to God um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2679" display="44:39" %}} - so this paragraph says so how do truth and faithfulness respond to sinful man  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2684" display="44:44" %}} - in his faithfulness and Truth God is entirely reliable and trustworthy in all that he promises to us and does for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2692" display="44:52" %}} - therefore his veracity and dependability in offering us a way through Jesus Jesus Christ to escape the evil of death and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2698" display="44:58" %}} - embrace the good of eternal life are Beyond reproach so even though we are sinful and by nature objects of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2705" display="45:05" %}} - wrath in his faithfulness and Truth God has nevertheless found a way to make peace between himself and us and to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2712" display="45:12" %}} - remove the enity between himself and US caused by our sins without corrupting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2717" display="45:17" %}} - his character namely by reconciling us to himself through the death of his son Jesus Christ so um God and and this kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2726" display="45:26" %}} - of gets also to what AI said last time uh 1 John chter 1:9 says that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2732" display="45:32" %}} - faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and all unrighteousness right um it's on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2738" display="45:38" %}} - basis of the blood of Christ that God can do that but he has promised us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2744" display="45:44" %}} - Redemption he promised Adam and Eve Redemption right after the fall Genesis chapter 3 um I can't remember if it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2751" display="45:51" %}} - verse 15 I think it's verse 17 let me see how good my memory is the Proto evangelium  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2757" display="45:57" %}} - um no yeah no okay not 17 my memory is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2763" display="46:03" %}} - that great definitely Genesis chapter 3 though after the curse probably it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2769" display="46:09" %}} - it's 21 it's 21 um and the Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2774" display="46:14" %}} - and clothes and this so-called Proto evangelium the First Gospel that we have here God promises Adam and Eve  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2781" display="46:21" %}} - Redemption salvation right the shedding of blood for the Forgiveness of sins as symbolized by the animals um you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2788" display="46:28" %}} - this uh the the blood sacrifice necessary to fulfill his justice as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2794" display="46:34" %}} - we'll get to his applied Holiness in creation but this is what we mean by God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2799" display="46:39" %}} - being faithful and true to forgive us of our sins and all un righteousness is that through Jesus Christ God is Not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2805" display="46:45" %}} - only able to but it is just it is uh you know according to his faithfulness and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2811" display="46:51" %}} - truth that he can forgive us of our sins because Jesus Christ has TR truly paid for it all um and again this is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2818" display="46:58" %}} - where we get a sense of the scale of the Cross of what it represents as the solution to our problems as Humanity to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2825" display="47:05" %}} - the sin and death problem to our that yawning Chasm between us and God is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2832" display="47:12" %}} - God has actually done so much already in sending his son to die for us that it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2839" display="47:19" %}} - the right thing to do to forgive us it is in line with his character it is in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2845" display="47:25" %}} - line with truth to forgive us of our sins because Jesus Christ paid for them that should blow our minds a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2852" display="47:32" %}} - right because we know that we sin every day and yet the Bible tells us that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2858" display="47:38" %}} - is just in forgiving us on the basis of his cross it is in character with you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2863" display="47:43" %}} - know him being the god of Truth to forgive us of our sins um that blows my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2869" display="47:49" %}} - mind um so are there things you want to say on these aspects of God's character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2875" display="47:55" %}} - Audi yeah I I really like the way you're putting it I think it's very simple and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2881" display="48:01" %}} - very succinct um I I want to stretch the bit the faithful and true thing is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2889" display="48:09" %}} - specifically addressing the satanic Rebellion so uh like I said the approach  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2896" display="48:16" %}} - that I would have taken or that I still want to explore for myself is more from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2903" display="48:23" %}} - you know God's character independent of the satanic Rebellion but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2908" display="48:28" %}} - this is in the context of our experience as sinful creatures who need Redemption and all of that which is very critical  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2916" display="48:36" %}} - because the Cross of Christ is really the whole point okay so when he speaks  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2922" display="48:42" %}} - to faithful and true this is actually a challenge to the satanic Rebellion which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2928" display="48:48" %}} - essentially said God is Not faithful and he is not true he clearly is keeping  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2934" display="48:54" %}} - things from us things that are good for us he doesn't want any competition so he's keeping the best things for himself  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2942" display="49:02" %}} - um so this this is what um Satan essentially did imping God's character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2949" display="49:09" %}} - and this this is the nature of sin so if anyone has a question what is sin sin is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2955" display="49:15" %}} - always imping God's character and seeking to take things from him that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2962" display="49:22" %}} - has not given because we believe we have a right to them and God is denying us of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2969" display="49:29" %}} - them so um when it speaks to faithful when we when we talk of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2976" display="49:36" %}} - character being faithful and true it is that he can be relied  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2984" display="49:44" %}} - on he can be trusted and this is critical to our walk  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2989" display="49:49" %}} - with the Lord especially in a world such as ours remembering again that the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2994" display="49:54" %}} - point of sin is is that God cannot be relied on so in a world where we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3000" display="50:00" %}} - facing the pressures that essentially tell us why listen to him why don't you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3006" display="50:06" %}} - do what you what you want because after all you can't trust him to be seeking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3012" display="50:12" %}} - out what is best for you now the response of the Bible to that is he gave  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3017" display="50:17" %}} - his son for your sin and think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3023" display="50:23" %}} - it um when we take into account what you've just said Stephen how God delivered us through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3030" display="50:30" %}} - sacrifice of Jesus Christ it's amazing it's amazing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3037" display="50:37" %}} - how someone who cannot tolerate sin someone who has no truck with sin he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3044" display="50:44" %}} - himself cannot do anything evil and cannot tolerate it can still forgive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3051" display="50:51" %}} - people who do in order for him to forgive people who do he has to do something  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3059" display="50:59" %}} - incredible something that Satan could not have known about because there was no occasion for that thing to ever arise  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3065" display="51:05" %}} - that God would create a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3071" display="51:11" %}} - sacrifice in order to make it possible for the one who cannot tolerate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3077" display="51:17" %}} - evil to restore to friendship with himself people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3083" display="51:23" %}} - evil that's a tri if we have any question as to God's faithfulness and to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3089" display="51:29" %}} - his truth that is the answer to it and that's how we can get through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3094" display="51:34" %}} - hardships of this life and the tribulations that will come always thinking just like Paul said if he gave  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3101" display="51:41" %}} - us his son how will how how will he not together with him give us all things so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3108" display="51:48" %}} - that is the Touchstone of think think of this contrast you brought this up I think this is a good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - example uh contrast the Serpent's accusation imputing the character of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3119" display="51:59" %}} - you must not eat from any tree in the garden right up here with God's promise  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3125" display="52:05" %}} - of redemption right verse 21 yes God promises them salvation through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3130" display="52:10" %}} - animal skins Satan says God's not trustworthy why would God tell you you can't eat from that tree right he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3137" display="52:17" %}} - implies something with that that's not a neutral question that is a leading question saying yeah you know God doing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3145" display="52:25" %}} - this is in some way making him not looking out for your best for your ultimate good whereas in fact God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3152" display="52:32" %}} - promises Redemption and you have to just keep in mind think about the thousands of years in between Adam and Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3159" display="52:39" %}} - right 4,000 gber take right um and and when you think about that 4,000 years  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3167" display="52:47" %}} - was this promise there I mean you think about Abraham right we're talking about God's faithfulness and Truth God tells  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3173" display="52:53" %}} - Abraham he will have an heir and through that air you know the his descendants would be like the grains of sand upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3180" display="53:00" %}} - the beach shore right Abraham had to wait decades for that son of promise  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3187" display="53:07" %}} - right for the son of the Covenant and this idea that we have here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3192" display="53:12" %}} - of God demonstrating his faithfulness despite the odds how about Noah too while we're on the topic of waiting um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3199" display="53:19" %}} - what hundreds of years right Noah built the ark 120 Am I Wrong um I don't know I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3205" display="53:25" %}} - have to go look but decades upon decades Noah was trusting God and God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3211" display="53:31" %}} - was faithful right um but notice in all these instances people many people the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3218" display="53:38" %}} - world in fact says that God is not um Satan says God is not scoffers in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - world say God is Not faithful um and sometimes like Abraham and Sarah having  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3229" display="53:49" %}} - doubt sometimes we doubt it as well we doubt that God is really faithful um that he'll really come through for us us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3237" display="53:57" %}} - so you know just as with the other things if we doubt that God is good on account of evil well if we doubt that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3243" display="54:03" %}} - God is faithful because we haven't seen Deliverance up until this day like AI said just think about what that will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3249" display="54:09" %}} - mean uh when the tribulation comes Upon Us in the world if God has already given us his son while we were yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3256" display="54:16" %}} - sinners what are we afraid of you know why why don't we trust God a little bit more than we do um this is not to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3264" display="54:24" %}} - that this is easy stuff we're talking about here uh trusting that God is faithful and true even in the face of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3270" display="54:30" %}} - immense suffering that is no easy thing that takes you know an immense amount of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3276" display="54:36" %}} - spiritual growth and character to Bear up under those tests and trust that even when we don't see the point of Escape  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3283" display="54:43" %}} - that like 1 Corinthians 10:13 tells us um you know he will not test us past what we can bear but he will always  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3290" display="54:50" %}} - provide an out a way for us to uh never never be put pushed past what we can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3296" display="54:56" %}} - actually handle um so it all comes down to Faith um it all comes down to our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3301" display="55:01" %}} - trust in the character of God that when the Bible teaches that God is faithful and true and we can trust his promises  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3307" display="55:07" %}} - that we actually believe that um and uh you know this is um I'm trying to think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3314" display="55:14" %}} - about the best way to phrase it maybe one of those things where uh especially if you grew up in church you kind of know the church answer to this question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3320" display="55:20" %}} - uh yeah yeah God is good God is holy God is faithful  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3325" display="55:25" %}} - but if you believe that it changes how you live your life it changes your relationship and you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3332" display="55:32" %}} - don't doubt God because why would you doubt God if you actually believe that he was completely faithful um and so I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3338" display="55:38" %}} - this I'm saying this as a challenge to myself as a challenge to all of us as we think about this is that when we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3344" display="55:44" %}} - that we believe that God is good that God is Holy that God is faithful and true if we believe those things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3351" display="55:51" %}} - shouldn't it change how we act shouldn't it change how we view God in our heads um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3357" display="55:57" %}} - we should give him the benefit of the doubt every single time there's no instance in which we have just occasion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3365" display="56:05" %}} - to actually doubt god um so obviously kind of harping on the obvious here boy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3370" display="56:10" %}} - that was bit repetitious should say that what I'm saying should not be controversial we all know this but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3377" display="56:17" %}} - living it is a lot harder than just knowing it um so I won't ramble more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3383" display="56:23" %}} - there um very important concept for us here to trust God's faithfulness because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3389" display="56:29" %}} - he was faithful in delivering us from our sin as he promised how much more so will he not Del Deliver Us from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3394" display="56:34" %}} - everything else all the obstacles that come before us in life so uh I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3401" display="56:41" %}} - that's where we'll end this one and we will pick up in the next section talking about God's sovereignty um as it applies  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3408" display="56:48" %}} - to his moral rulership of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3413" display="56:53" %}} - universe so now we're going to talk kind of about the bridge section here in our study of God's character so just like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3420" display="57:00" %}} - when how we were studying God's infinite nature uh we kind of tied um God's essential characteristics to how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3427" display="57:07" %}} - manifest in creation uh through his uniqueness no one is like God in the universe we're going to do a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3434" display="57:14" %}} - similar thing here with respect to God's perfect character discussing how all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - how all of the characteristics that we've been talking about in terms of his goodness his Holiness his faithfulness and Truth manifest in the universe um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3447" display="57:27" %}} - and so we are going to in so doing that be talking about God's sovereignty um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3453" display="57:33" %}} - and so I'll read from the slide here a little bit we're going to go through several slides here in this one um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3458" display="57:38" %}} - talking about how all of these things kind of Link together and give us that uh that full picture of God's Redemptive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3465" display="57:45" %}} - plan for human history which as we've noted a couple times here has been the way that Dr Lil has structured um this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3472" display="57:52" %}} - study of God theology proper at least this initial section on God's nature and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3477" display="57:57" %}} - character so sovereignty um kind of a long word here sovereignty comes from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3483" display="58:03" %}} - God's perfect character so just how on account of his uniqueness we said that no one else God is Du all the honor and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3490" display="58:10" %}} - the glory because no one else is like him in the universe well no one else has a legitimate right to rule over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3496" display="58:16" %}} - universe and that's what we mean by God being Sovereign he is the absolute Sovereign within his own creation and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3502" display="58:22" %}} - therefore the one person to whom all honor is due sovereignty thus speaks to God's moral Authority and right to order  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3509" display="58:29" %}} - the universe however he chooses so if God is the defao ruler of the Universe on account of his abilities that no one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3517" display="58:37" %}} - uh no one else is omnipotent and omniscient and omnipresent well it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3522" display="58:42" %}} - because of his moral Authority that God is the deure ruler of the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3527" display="58:47" %}} - because no one else has the right to judge moral creatures in the way that God does from the standpoint of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3534" display="58:54" %}} - Transcendence of the moral Universe God is Sovereign by virtue of his goodness his Holiness and his truth essential  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3540" display="59:00" %}} - qualities independent of his creation those are the things we've just talked about and here's where we get the bridge  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3546" display="59:06" %}} - uh to the next things that we're going to be discussing so those were the things that were his essential qualities  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3552" display="59:12" %}} - independent of his creation but from the standpoint of his Supremacy within the moral Universe God is Sovereign by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3559" display="59:19" %}} - virtue of his love his Justice and life qualities applying to his creation which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3564" display="59:24" %}} - Corr respond to goodness Holiness and Truth um so this is very similar to how we had discussion in the first series  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3572" display="59:32" %}} - how these things were linked together except now we're talking about God's sovereignty his moral Authority and right to order the universe from a moral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3580" display="59:40" %}} - standpoint only God is qualified to be the ultimate judge of the morally accountable creatures he has created so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3587" display="59:47" %}} - that's us that's Angels creatures with Free Will and thus to hold them responsible for their actions as day  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3594" display="59:54" %}} - fact of the riverse the de facto ruler of the universe through his perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3599" display="59:59" %}} - nature and dejur ruler of the universe through his perfect character God can do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3605" display="1:00:05" %}} - these things and so that's the next several slides that we're going to talk about this is why I said all of this stuff all part of one cohesive whole so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3612" display="1:00:12" %}} - because God is the de facto and deur ruler of the universe through his perfect nature and his perfect character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3618" display="1:00:18" %}} - God can God possesses The Sovereign authority to demonstrate love to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3623" display="1:00:23" %}} - sinful creatures out of his own goodness and so these slides are going to be showing you that relationship between  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3629" display="1:00:29" %}} - these essential qualities of God and these qualities working themselves out in creation so here we have um God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3637" display="1:00:37" %}} - demonstrating love out of his goodness next we're GNA have Justice coming from Holiness and after that life coming from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3643" display="1:00:43" %}} - truth and faithfulness but this first one God possesses The Sovereign authority to demonstrate love to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3649" display="1:00:49" %}} - sinful creatures out of his goodness not ignoring their sins as evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3655" display="1:00:55" %}} - suggests he should but paying for them himself by the death on the cross of his son Jesus Christ in their place this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3662" display="1:01:02" %}} - process what we just said there paying for the sins through the death of his son on the cross that's called  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3668" display="1:01:08" %}} - Redemption so we call the result of this act of his sovereignty Grace we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3673" display="1:01:13" %}} - saved by grace through faith that's commonly how you'll hear it uh Hebrew word for this word is so that's a a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3681" display="1:01:21" %}} - difficult character for us as English speakers to pronounce um and the Hebrew true word here is Cardis um starting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3687" display="1:01:27" %}} - with a Kai um so Grace is the God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3692" display="1:01:32" %}} - attitude God's Sovereign attitude towards man as a demonstration of his goodness and his love for us next one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3700" display="1:01:40" %}} - God possesses you know again God being the de facto deur ruler of the Universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3706" display="1:01:46" %}} - um as the deao deur ruler of the universe God possesses The Sovereign authority to administer Justice to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3713" display="1:01:53" %}} - sinful creatures out of his Holiness so not abandoning them to their sins as evil suggests he must but forgiving them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3721" display="1:02:01" %}} - himself on the basis of the death on the cross of his son Jesus Christ in their place so uh before we said that paying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3729" display="1:02:09" %}} - for our sins on the cross through the death of Christ was Redemption here we're saying that forgiving our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3736" display="1:02:16" %}} - based on the death of Christ on the cross is called justification um these are important words in terms of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3743" display="1:02:23" %}} - would call atonement theory in terms of this progression of how God Saves  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3748" display="1:02:28" %}} - mankind um so we call the result of this act of his sovereignty Mercy um again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3754" display="1:02:34" %}} - Hebrew word here and Greek is alos um important sort of technical theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3761" display="1:02:41" %}} - vocabulary all over the place here um God forgives us and that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3767" display="1:02:47" %}} - justification forgiving us on the basis of the blood of his son and God doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3773" display="1:02:53" %}} - have to forgive us that's what makes this Mercy is that in no way did God have to send his son to forgive us out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3778" display="1:02:58" %}} - of our sins uh to get us out of our sins he did that because of his Mercy right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3784" display="1:03:04" %}} - he paid for our sins uh as an act of Grace he forgives of forgives us of our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3789" display="1:03:09" %}} - sins as an act of mercy and that leads us to this third one that as de facto and de Jer a ruler of the universe God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3797" display="1:03:17" %}} - possesses The Sovereign authority to give life to his sinful creatures out of his truth and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3803" display="1:03:23" %}} - faithfulness not allowing his creatures to die in their sins as evil suggests he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3808" display="1:03:28" %}} - will but reconciling them to himself through the the death on the cross of his son Jesus Christ in their place this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3815" display="1:03:35" %}} - is what we call reconciliation we are reconciled to the father through the blood of Christ we call the result of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3822" display="1:03:42" %}} - this act of his sovereignty peace again Hebrew word and Greek word probably heard this one before Hebrew word is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3829" display="1:03:49" %}} - Shalom peace and the Greek word is a um and so these are all of these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3838" display="1:03:58" %}} - speak of God's Redemptive purpose in human history redeeming us to himself despite what evil says so if you compare  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3845" display="1:04:05" %}} - across um these three slides making all of these points in sequential order here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3850" display="1:04:10" %}} - evil suggests that God should ignore their sins but instead God paid for them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3856" display="1:04:16" %}} - evil suggests that God should abandon us to our sins but God forgave us instead  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3862" display="1:04:22" %}} - and evil suggests that God should allow us to die in our sins but instead God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3867" display="1:04:27" %}} - reconciled us to him um and so this is the powerful story of redemption that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3872" display="1:04:32" %}} - God has wrought throughout history this is why the cross of Jesus Christ was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3877" display="1:04:37" %}} - that winning move that we've been talking about in fact this is the very reason why human history is playing out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3883" display="1:04:43" %}} - as it is and that point that I just made is where a lot of Bible teaching on the subject they fail to make that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3889" display="1:04:49" %}} - connection they fail to realize that human history is a response resp to Satan's Rebellion that God has created  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3897" display="1:04:57" %}} - us in order to demonstrate that in fact sinful creatures can be reconciled to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3902" display="1:05:02" %}} - him despite what the angel said despite Satan's PR platform saying God wouldn't be able to do this that is exactly what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3909" display="1:05:09" %}} - God is doing and that is the reason why humans were created along with being created to demonstrate the glory of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3915" display="1:05:15" %}} - but you know that's sort of the the normal catechism answer but this is the wider meaning to human history all right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3923" display="1:05:23" %}} - so obious a lot to unpack there a lot to keep straight in our heads hence handy table right so we have been talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3930" display="1:05:30" %}} - about God's essential qualities manifesting in creation as certain things right so I've kind of titled this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3936" display="1:05:36" %}} - slide as God's sovereignty in action um lots of technical terms here so God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3942" display="1:05:42" %}} - goodness manifests in his creation as love for us and through that love for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3948" display="1:05:48" %}} - God has paid for human sin uh this is coming out of his sovereign attitude of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3955" display="1:05:55" %}} - Grace and results in our Redemption right so a lot there going to go ahead and go through this table and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3961" display="1:06:01" %}} - we may spend some time unpacking this as we go but God's essential quality of Holiness manifests in Creation in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3968" display="1:06:08" %}} - perfect Justice and the action God takes based on his Justice is Forgiven human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3973" display="1:06:13" %}} - sin um based on his attitude towards us of Mercy leading to our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3980" display="1:06:20" %}} - justification um so that is scratching out our sin in the legal record as it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3985" display="1:06:25" %}} - were that's what justification is as to his essential quality of Truth this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3991" display="1:06:31" %}} - manifests in creation through god-given life um the action God takes is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3996" display="1:06:36" %}} - reconciling sinful man to himself out of his Sovereign attitude towards us of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4002" display="1:06:42" %}} - Peace resulting in our reconciliation with him so in all of these things you can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4008" display="1:06:48" %}} - see that God's full plan for saving sinful man absolutely everything in this plan relies upon the cross the blood of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4016" display="1:06:56" %}} - Jesus Christ um so I actually really like this way phrasing it I don't even remember where I came across this I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4021" display="1:07:01" %}} - think it was like when I was younger a kid maybe 10 12 um I've heard it phrased this way that God's mercy and Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4028" display="1:07:08" %}} - intersect in the cross right the cross is everything as it relates to saving  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4034" display="1:07:14" %}} - mankind out of our sins um so uh we may need to go through this a couple times I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4039" display="1:07:19" %}} - mean I sure had to uh make sure that I squinted at it and and got it all straight in the words in our head um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4047" display="1:07:27" %}} - you know obviously these things that we're talking about Redemption justification reconciliation um these are parts of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4053" display="1:07:33" %}} - that process that we go through as Christian and how we relate to God what God has done for us in a theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4059" display="1:07:39" %}} - sense so um all sorts of places where we could take this but I know I've talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4065" display="1:07:45" %}} - for a good few minutes here this is how we see God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4070" display="1:07:50" %}} - sovereignty uh play out in the universe God in sovereign in control of all events that happen but in particular we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4077" display="1:07:57" %}} - see God working uh for us for our Salvation uh through the sacrificing of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4083" display="1:08:03" %}} - his son Jesus Christ that we might be saved that we might be uh redeemed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4089" display="1:08:09" %}} - Justified um and reconciled to him not only now in time but also eternally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4095" display="1:08:15" %}} - forever more um so uh aie uh I'll turn it over to you um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4102" display="1:08:22" %}} - what do you want to say um about all of this that we've gone through is there anything that jumps out at you uh that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4107" display="1:08:27" %}} - we kind of haven't already covered here so um the satanic rebellion was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4113" display="1:08:33" %}} - challenge to God's right to rule that was what it was it was Satan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4119" display="1:08:39" %}} - saying I get why why don't I get to be God too why don't I get to rule over  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4125" display="1:08:45" %}} - creation myself as well and um what Professor Robert presents is is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4131" display="1:08:51" %}} - argument for Why God has has the right to rule he says that that right is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4137" display="1:08:57" %}} - moral one and that it is rooted in God's character and he goes on to explain how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4143" display="1:09:03" %}} - God's how to argue how God's character qualifies him to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4148" display="1:09:08" %}} - rule so that is a very solid argument and it actually is just as you said and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4156" display="1:09:16" %}} - as exis continues to unfold um in all of its studies  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4161" display="1:09:21" %}} - that it it it is the point of human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4167" display="1:09:27" %}} - history human history is God's argument for his right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4174" display="1:09:34" %}} - rule in fact that is what First Corinthians 15 essentially says and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4180" display="1:09:40" %}} - comes the end when he will hand over the kingdom to the father so the idea here is in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4187" display="1:09:47" %}} - end all Rebellion is squashed all enemies are removed and God gets to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4193" display="1:09:53" %}} - exercise his full rights without any opposition to rule over the creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4199" display="1:09:59" %}} - that he made I tend to think about God's sovereignty in a in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4206" display="1:10:06" %}} - multi-dimensional way on the one hand he has the right to rule creation because he made it I mean even if he was even if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4215" display="1:10:15" %}} - it were possible and it is not even if it were possible that to think of God's character as anything but good he has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4222" display="1:10:22" %}} - the right to rule because made it well just almost think of it like intellectual property rights right you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4229" display="1:10:29" %}} - know exact we have that God can remix and modify because he's the one who created it yes yeah so there is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4237" display="1:10:37" %}} - right of ownership on the one half but the Bible goes beyond that which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4243" display="1:10:43" %}} - actually you know it's like when when God said to Israel in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4248" display="1:10:48" %}} - Mali um how did he put it that it's in Malachi 1 but I'll paraphrase the idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4255" display="1:10:55" %}} - is this that even a donkey knows its master and will give due respect to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4261" display="1:11:01" %}} - to its master and um a father has uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4267" display="1:11:07" %}} - respect that is due to him so does a governor if I'm a father where is my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4272" display="1:11:12" %}} - respect I don't get anything you you don't treat me with any respect given my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4278" display="1:11:18" %}} - role my place in your life you wouldn't be a nation unless I made you one that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4284" display="1:11:24" %}} - what he was saying to them and more than once in the prophets he told them your  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4289" display="1:11:29" %}} - father was an araman was a Syrian and I I made him I took him out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4295" display="1:11:35" %}} - of Syria and made him into a great nation so basically I have the right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4302" display="1:11:42" %}} - make demands of you because you exist because of me that's the right of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4308" display="1:11:48" %}} - ownership and if anything were God that thing would have that right over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4313" display="1:11:53" %}} - creation that it makes but beyond that the argument that um exus is particular focused on is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4320" display="1:12:00" %}} - moral argument which is essentially this that God's character is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4326" display="1:12:06" %}} - good and that he is he is loving he is perfect he does not do any wrong so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4334" display="1:12:14" %}} - everything that Satan has accused him up has been proven to be false see God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4343" display="1:12:23" %}} - cannot abide evil and he does not do evil and he reconciles the the evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4350" display="1:12:30" %}} - person to himself if the if the evil person is willing to repent all of that is to say what better can you get who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4358" display="1:12:38" %}} - has your best interest at heart other than me in other words you are safest  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4364" display="1:12:44" %}} - and Most Blessed under my wings this is the second argument on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4370" display="1:12:50" %}} - one hand I have the right to rule over you because I made you on the other hand I have the right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4376" display="1:12:56" %}} - rule over you because nobody wants better things for you than I do and nobody can provide those things better  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4382" display="1:13:02" %}} - than I can like I am it for you if you're ever going to have anything good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4389" display="1:13:09" %}} - it's going to come from me that's the second argument now that second argument is more important from the excess point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4397" display="1:13:17" %}} - of you because this is a fight um of free will we have to make a willing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4403" display="1:13:23" %}} - choice if we reject God's right of ownership that's fine he doesn't rule  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4408" display="1:13:28" %}} - over us for eternity but then we don't end up in anything good for all eternity we are stuck in the Lake of Fire in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4414" display="1:13:34" %}} - place of misery but that for that reason the main focus here is the moral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4421" display="1:13:41" %}} - right given the chance to make an existence for yourself rather than to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4428" display="1:13:48" %}} - accept one that I make for you do you do any better and we live in a world where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4434" display="1:13:54" %}} - again and again the answer to that is no that we don't do better by ourselves we don't do better away from God's mercies  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4441" display="1:14:01" %}} - and his Graces so we see that God's right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4446" display="1:14:06" %}} - rule is rooted in the Perfection of his character the true sacrificial nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4452" display="1:14:12" %}} - his love for us that he is willing to give the most to give  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4458" display="1:14:18" %}} - everything even when we are in a position of enmity against him  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4463" display="1:14:23" %}} - that is the Seal of his sovereignty the right he has to rule over us and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4469" display="1:14:29" %}} - ends all of the satanic Rebellion it puts paid to all of Satan's arguments because it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4475" display="1:14:35" %}} - says if you rule over yourself you don't make anything better I can't make bad  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4481" display="1:14:41" %}} - things I can't make an evil world I cannot and I can't tolerate one and on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4487" display="1:14:47" %}} - top of that even if you have made an evil world I can reconcile you to myself  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4492" display="1:14:52" %}} - and give you a perfect world I don't think anything in the satanic rebellion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4498" display="1:14:58" %}} - in all the lies that we have b as human beings can stand up to this that's the argument that exis is actually making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4504" display="1:15:04" %}} - now when we think of this in terms of sovereignty um in terms of the uh what we call de facto deur uh Authority that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4514" display="1:15:14" %}} - God has you might also sort of think of it like this if you view God's abilities  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4519" display="1:15:19" %}} - um in the same way you might view like an apex predator like a tiger right a tiger has might might makes right sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4526" display="1:15:26" %}} - of thing right a tiger is the ruler of the Jungle simply because there is no one stronger than him right but a king  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4534" display="1:15:34" %}} - is not necessarily a king because he's the strongest right there might be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4539" display="1:15:39" %}} - Warriors or military leaders who have more military mind right or Scholars who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4545" display="1:15:45" %}} - have more intellectual Cloud a king is a the leader of a country at least  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4552" display="1:15:52" %}} - throughout history right not that we have King so much anymore but you know let me let me go with my parallel okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4557" display="1:15:57" %}} - um so a king is the king of a country not maybe because he is the strongest or the smartest but because he carries the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4565" display="1:16:05" %}} - scepter of rulership right um and when we think of in the Bible Jesus you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4571" display="1:16:11" %}} - uh subduing the nations with a rod of iron making them the foot stol of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4576" display="1:16:16" %}} - God God is King of the universe by existential Fiat because he is the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4582" display="1:16:22" %}} - with ownership right as we've talked about the one who has this uh not just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4588" display="1:16:28" %}} - because of strength but because of moral Authority um that is a level above just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4595" display="1:16:35" %}} - being the strongest that is having what we would call the moral right to control  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4602" display="1:16:42" %}} - what goes on in his Universe in the same way that a homeowner for example might have the moral right to control what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4608" display="1:16:48" %}} - goes on in his home right or the citizens of a country  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4613" display="1:16:53" %}} - having the right to self-determine what goes on in their country you see where I'm going with this right the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4620" display="1:17:00" %}} - is Gods to control by moral right um not just because he's the strongest and he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4625" display="1:17:05" %}} - can impose his will upon others but because he has the right to do it um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4631" display="1:17:11" %}} - that's God's sovereignty yeah all right well uh you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4636" display="1:17:16" %}} - obviously more to talk about in all of this um we will as you'll see again uh as we turn to some of the uh what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4642" display="1:17:22" %}} - would call as the characteristics of God manifesting in creation his love his Justice and his life here um we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4649" display="1:17:29" %}} - once again uh see the essential qualities his goodness his Holiness and his truth as well as his Sovereign  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4655" display="1:17:35" %}} - attitude towards us in grace mercy and peace all these things will recur as we talk about um how God manifests his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4662" display="1:17:42" %}} - goodness and his Holiness and his truth in creation um so those will be the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4667" display="1:17:47" %}} - topics that we turn to um in the next slides here um but this will kind of conclude the discussion that we've had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4674" display="1:17:54" %}} - here about God's sovereignty so God is unique um on account of his infinite nature um his abilities that no other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4682" display="1:18:02" %}} - can match and God is Sovereign on account of his moral perfection he has the right by existential Fiat to order  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4688" display="1:18:08" %}} - the universe as he sees fit because he is The Sovereign deure ruler of it these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4694" display="1:18:14" %}} - things together explain why God is due all obedience and honor and Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4700" display="1:18:20" %}} - because he is the ruler of the universe um both by nature and by character um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4707" display="1:18:27" %}} - is the one that is in complete control of everything so we will pick up more as I say with these aspects of Love Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4715" display="1:18:35" %}} - and life on these parts of God's characters they manifest in creation uh as we keep on going through the next  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4721" display="1:18:41" %}} - slides in this lesson here all right so the first point that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4728" display="1:18:48" %}} - we are going to be going over now is how God is love and so this is kind of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4733" display="1:18:53" %}} - manifestation of his essential quality of goodness as it relates to Creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4738" display="1:18:58" %}} - for us in the universe and in the next couple sections we'll also be talking about how his Holiness manifests Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4745" display="1:19:05" %}} - and his truth manifest his life uh but here talking first about how his goodness manifests his love I'm going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4752" display="1:19:12" %}} - kind of read the paragraph This is again straight from the study on ichus here and then uh kind of go from there to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4757" display="1:19:17" %}} - elaborate on that so ikus says having love for his creatures is natural  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4763" display="1:19:23" %}} - consequence of God's goodness out of the intrinsic goodness of his character God loves us with a perfect love Desiring to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4770" display="1:19:30" %}} - help us in our sinful State however he does not Overlook his Holiness and Justice in the process and forgive our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4776" display="1:19:36" %}} - sin without consequence as evil suggests he should therefore God had to find a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4781" display="1:19:41" %}} - way to reach out to us in Love Without compromising his character and did so through the gift and sacrifice of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4787" display="1:19:47" %}} - only son on our behalf um so this is very parallel to what we had been talking about uh in the last section uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4796" display="1:19:56" %}} - talking uh kind of in this summary of God's sovereignty and his Sovereign plan for human history as he redeems Humanity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4804" display="1:20:04" %}} - out of our sinfulness we talked about this this was this slide talking about how uh God possesses The Sovereign  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4810" display="1:20:10" %}} - authority to demonstrate love out of his goodness uh so this should sound familiar is what I'm saying um because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4816" display="1:20:16" %}} - we just talked about that actually but um this is the same thing that we've been saying is that everything for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4823" display="1:20:23" %}} - centers on the cross uh it is the inflection point in all of human history  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4828" display="1:20:28" %}} - that that single winning move where death Was Defeated once for all and God does this out of his love for us so not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4835" display="1:20:35" %}} - contradicting his Justice he reached out to us in love through the sacrifice of his son that we might be saved um also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4842" display="1:20:42" %}} - building on that theological vocabulary we say that Grace is the biblical name for God's policy of lovingly redeeming  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4849" display="1:20:49" %}} - us from our sins through Jesus Christ um so this is his his loving kindness you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4854" display="1:20:54" %}} - may also see older translations like the KJV use that a bit wordy for us perhaps  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4859" display="1:20:59" %}} - in Modern English but this idea of God's good will his grace his attitude of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4865" display="1:21:05" %}} - Grace towards humanity is shown in this so we accept and receive God's gracious offer of love and Redemption by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4872" display="1:21:12" %}} - accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our savior um so for Evangelical Christians this is nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4878" display="1:21:18" %}} - new right we have salvation by grace through faith not by works um but we accept God's love in fact we reciprocate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4886" display="1:21:26" %}} - God's love only by accepting Jesus Christ as our savior U by believing in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4891" display="1:21:31" %}} - him that is uh our act as Christians by which we demonstrate to God that we love him back um so that's where we'll start  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4899" display="1:21:39" %}} - here um I should also say that there's an interesting verse uh I think it's in 1 John chapter 4 it talks about how God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4906" display="1:21:46" %}} - is love like uh I don't know we don't want to get bogged down in the philosophy of this but um you know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4913" display="1:21:53" %}} - basically because God is love we need to love one another just how God loves us so there's a lot of uh what I would call  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4921" display="1:22:01" %}} - practical application that comes across from this point um the Bible in a couple places uh uses God's sacrifice for us is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4929" display="1:22:09" %}} - this ought to be defining motivation for us to lay down our lives for each other uh the Brethren our brothers and sisters  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4936" display="1:22:16" %}} - in the church uh because we ought to follow God's example um so that's where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4942" display="1:22:22" %}} - all open us I mean we could certainly go through more of this passage here in 1 John chapter 4 but because God is love  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4948" display="1:22:28" %}} - so also we must love one another um uh you know in fact this is basically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4953" display="1:22:33" %}} - verbatim word for word what we just went over in that paragraph from the study was that in this love God was made  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4958" display="1:22:38" %}} - manifest among us through his kind of through his attitude of Grace that he sent his only son that we might live  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4964" display="1:22:44" %}} - through him um uh very traditional formulation of the Gospel itself so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4969" display="1:22:49" %}} - Audie do you have anything you want to pick up uh based on what we're talking about here specifically with regard to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4975" display="1:22:55" %}} - how God is love um yeah uh I I want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4982" display="1:23:02" %}} - say that first of all um like you said everything is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4989" display="1:23:09" %}} - centered around the cross of Jesus Christ and uh thought that that has uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4995" display="1:23:15" %}} - caused me to um try to make sense of is why like what does what does that mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5003" display="1:23:23" %}} - um we know from First Corinthians 15 that the goal of everything that's happening in the universe in creation is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5010" display="1:23:30" %}} - that ultimately the kingdom will be turned over to the father we also know that what started all the rock the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5018" display="1:23:38" %}} - rockus in in creation was that Satan aspired to God's throne and wanted  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5025" display="1:23:45" %}} - to well commit a to take over the universe from the Lord we know that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5031" display="1:23:51" %}} - was happening so the whole thing really is about the fact that God is the rightful King of the universe and um I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5038" display="1:23:58" %}} - believe I mentioned last Saturday that um um God has the right to rule by by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5045" display="1:24:05" %}} - right of creation he owns creation but Satan essentially did not challenge that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5050" display="1:24:10" %}} - R he did not challenge that r on the basis of like well um You Don't Own  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5057" display="1:24:17" %}} - creation because you made it he challenged it more on the on the basis  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5063" display="1:24:23" %}} - of you don't love creation enough to Merit ruling over it because after all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5071" display="1:24:31" %}} - creation um comprises as well creatures that have a free will that is they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5078" display="1:24:38" %}} - the ability to respond to God's Authority either in submission or in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5084" display="1:24:44" %}} - Rebellion um so basically was like just because you made me does not give you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5091" display="1:24:51" %}} - the right to rule over me was essentially what he was saying and when he went on his um on his uh uh campaign  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5101" display="1:25:01" %}} - to win the hearts and minds of his fellow angels of course we know that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5106" display="1:25:06" %}} - made Arguments for Why God was not really acting in their best interest he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5111" display="1:25:11" %}} - had denied them of an actual physical body and probably restricted them in some other ways who knows what arguments  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5118" display="1:25:18" %}} - he made but the ex disposition of course is that he was particularly driving at the fact that Angels lacked physical  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5124" display="1:25:24" %}} - bodies that makes sense judging by what we saw in Jesus's Ministry how he often  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5131" display="1:25:31" %}} - had to deal with throwing demons out of the bodies of human beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5137" display="1:25:37" %}} - so the the what is at the root of creature Rebellion is this this feeling  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5143" display="1:25:43" %}} - like God is not acting in my best interest he doesn't love me enough to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5148" display="1:25:48" %}} - give me what I need to have or what is right for me to have he is denying me of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5156" display="1:25:56" %}} - things that are good for me to have so it is actually the love of God that is being called into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5162" display="1:26:02" %}} - question if I am being denied something I want then God's love is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5169" display="1:26:09" %}} - either not there or it is insufficient and if God does not love me as I need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5176" display="1:26:16" %}} - be loved why should I obey him why should I submit to him because I will just live in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5182" display="1:26:22" %}} - misery so why Jesus's cross is at the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5188" display="1:26:28" %}} - center of everything is that it is the perfect the ultimate demonstration of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5193" display="1:26:33" %}} - God's love for his creation because here is the thing there is no greater love that it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5199" display="1:26:39" %}} - is possible for any creature to show than just as you have just pointed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5205" display="1:26:45" %}} - out laying down your life for those who are your  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5210" display="1:26:50" %}} - friends no no man can do better than that but God want went miles better than  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5219" display="1:26:59" %}} - that Jesus laid down his life for his enemies for his father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5224" display="1:27:04" %}} - enemies for those who if if they had the ability to do it they would drive God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5231" display="1:27:11" %}} - out of his creation they would even kill God if that were a thing that was was even possible that's what they tried to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5236" display="1:27:16" %}} - do with Jesus Christ anyway we can't do it we are God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5243" display="1:27:23" %}} - avowed enemies and his response to our enmity against him is to offer a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5251" display="1:27:31" %}} - sacrifice to reconcile us back to him to forgive his enemies that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5258" display="1:27:38" %}} - biggest thing in the universe nobody can do it and that put the light to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5264" display="1:27:44" %}} - everything Satan has said about God whether to his fellow to his fellow Angels or to or to human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5270" display="1:27:50" %}} - beings at the root of everything sin is God is denying me of something that is good for me to have so he cannot truly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5277" display="1:27:57" %}} - love me or his love for me is insufficient now we have seen that he has gone well beyond anything we could  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5285" display="1:28:05" %}} - possibly ask for by saying even though you have spited me and wronged me and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5292" display="1:28:12" %}} - destroyed my creation and even though you deserve the worst from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5297" display="1:28:17" %}} - me I am offering you an opportunity to come back into my family and here's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5302" display="1:28:22" %}} - thing Jesus gave us an excellent example of this an excellent demonstration of this when he talked about the parable of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5309" display="1:28:29" %}} - the of the prodal son The Prodigal Son returned recognizing that he had no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5315" display="1:28:35" %}} - rights anymore in his father's house he did not ask to be restored to sunship he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5321" display="1:28:41" %}} - said make me one of your servants one of these slaves of yours because after all they they their tummies are always full  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5328" display="1:28:48" %}} - they may not be looking forward to any um inheritance anymore more but at least I will have a full tummy and I will have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5336" display="1:28:56" %}} - gainful work that is worth doing this is the position that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5341" display="1:29:01" %}} - we could hope for we had no right to even hope for that much and yet what God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5347" display="1:29:07" %}} - did was not just bring us back as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5352" display="1:29:12" %}} - creatures in his Universe he brought us back as his sons not just his sons but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5360" display="1:29:20" %}} - coair with Christ so the cross of Jesus Christ is very well and truly the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5366" display="1:29:26" %}} - because it demonstrates exactly the love that God has for his creation so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5372" display="1:29:32" %}} - now the argument for God's right to rule is both that yes he made the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5377" display="1:29:37" %}} - and is entitled to it because it is his creation but now for the Free Will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5383" display="1:29:43" %}} - creatures in it who have the right to respond to him either willingly or to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5390" display="1:29:50" %}} - reject him now he tells them I have the moral right to rule over you because nobody wants  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5397" display="1:29:57" %}} - better for you than I do that's uh I know when we uh talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5403" display="1:30:03" %}} - about this in the last section we brought up I think maybe we didn't I don't know if we didn't we should I'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5409" display="1:30:09" %}} - bring up the the parallel of parents um so we know that the Bible speaks of how we are to honor and obey our parents and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5417" display="1:30:17" %}} - part of that is because our parents want what's best for us they have this right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5422" display="1:30:22" %}} - to govern so long as we live under their roof uh to govern our actions as their children because of their care for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5429" display="1:30:29" %}} - they have been entrusted uh with our well-being and of course nobody is uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5437" display="1:30:37" %}} - more in control of the universe in God you know who who holds the lives of all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5442" display="1:30:42" %}} - of his creatures in his hands you know so while human parents may have the lives of their children in their hands  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5448" display="1:30:48" %}} - so to speak I you know up to a certain extent and uh perhaps even public servants so we might think elected  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5454" display="1:30:54" %}} - officials uh perhaps fancy themselves as having the lives of their constituents in their hands well God has the lives of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5462" display="1:31:02" %}} - everyone in the universe and his right Angel and and uh human being alike um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5468" display="1:31:08" %}} - one other thing I I just thought this verse in Romans is always such a powerful verse you know talking about how God died for us while we were yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5475" display="1:31:15" %}} - sinners right um this is love you know I I was thinking there's a verse in the gospels too uh Echoes this about uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5483" display="1:31:23" %}} - know for a good person someone might possibly Dare To Die maybe or maybe it's only here in Romans anyway point being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5489" display="1:31:29" %}} - um this is self-sacrificing love and Par Parable The Prodigal son's actually really interesting in context when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5495" display="1:31:35" %}} - talk about love as well because part of love the love that we're supposed to have as Christians is we're supposed to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5501" display="1:31:41" %}} - celebrate like how God celebrates when Sinners repent um and I think very often our tendency as humans is not to throw  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5508" display="1:31:48" %}} - the party for the repentant sinner but be like the older brothers that says but look at me I have sacrificed so much why  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5514" display="1:31:54" %}} - are we celebrating for him look at look at all I've done right what about me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5520" display="1:32:00" %}} - that pride and ego get in the way right so even though what we're celebrating is someone coming from Death to life we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5526" display="1:32:06" %}} - but what about all my hard work where's my recognition um but God's love wants  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5532" display="1:32:12" %}} - what is actually best for all of us um and I don't want to get too off too off  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5537" display="1:32:17" %}} - topic here because I'm sure we could ramble for a while but you know Greek has all these different words for love you may have come across a teaching that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5544" display="1:32:24" %}} - that hits on this a bit too uh so the form of divine love typically in view when we talk about how God is love this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5551" display="1:32:31" %}} - love we're supposed to show to one another within the body of Christ and even show to the world is is the Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5556" display="1:32:36" %}} - word for it is agape um and it's typically described as divine unconditional love um Love without  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5563" display="1:32:43" %}} - strings attached so to speak and that is the sort of love whereby we love our enemies um there's also sto that's kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5571" display="1:32:51" %}} - kind of like the love between parents and children familial love um filia it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5577" display="1:32:57" %}} - not actually used directly in the New Testament like the Greek word for that isn't a fet which is a a verb that comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5585" display="1:33:05" %}} - up a bit more um and then there's also AOS which is the um uh you know sexual  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5591" display="1:33:11" %}} - passion um and so these are all translated in English with the same word but specifically what we're talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5597" display="1:33:17" %}} - about when we say God is love is that God is a he is this unconditional Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5603" display="1:33:23" %}} - love that wants the best for everyone and that's why he sent his son to die for us and take our sins upon his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5611" display="1:33:31" %}} - shoulders um to save us uh again out of this policy of Grace that he has towards  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5616" display="1:33:36" %}} - us acting in what is actually our best interest um redeeming us right that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5621" display="1:33:41" %}} - the theological term here buying uh us out of sin that's what redeeming is we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5627" display="1:33:47" %}} - have been redeemed as slaves to sin um so all very good points anything else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5633" display="1:33:53" %}} - you want to say before we go on to the next one no I I think we can go on okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5642" display="1:34:02" %}} - great so now we're going to be talking about how God is just and so uh God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5648" display="1:34:08" %}} - lovingly redeemed us out of our bondage to sin uh but God is also just and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5654" display="1:34:14" %}} - thing that should blow our minds about this a little bit is that when God forgives us on the basis of his Mercy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5660" display="1:34:20" %}} - because he sent his son to die Justice is being rendered this isn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5665" display="1:34:25" %}} - like God is somehow overlooking our sin is that Jesus paid for it um the debt  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5671" display="1:34:31" %}} - has been paid the accounts have been settled uh I think sometimes maybe we get uh I don't know quite how the right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5678" display="1:34:38" %}} - way to describe this might be but maybe we don't we don't feel that as impactfully as we ought that when when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5686" display="1:34:46" %}} - Jesus was on the cross he paid for that sin uh this uh in other words our forgiveness had a price that came with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5692" display="1:34:52" %}} - it it wasn't uh just with an arbitrary wave of the hand that God forgives the far forgives forgives us of our sin boy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5701" display="1:35:01" %}} - hard hard to say I guess um and so that's kind of what we're getting at here when we talk about God's justice so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5707" display="1:35:07" %}} - I'm gonna go ahead and read again coming right out of the study here on ikus so it says demanding Justice for his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5713" display="1:35:13" %}} - creatures is a natural consequence of God's holiness so holiness is that essential characteristic of God we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5719" display="1:35:19" %}} - been talking about before his need to be separate from sin um so out of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5724" display="1:35:24" %}} - intrinsic Holiness of his character God must must that's a mandatory must deal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5730" display="1:35:30" %}} - with us in perfect Justice righteously condemning us in our sinful State however he does not Overlook his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5736" display="1:35:36" %}} - goodness and his love in the process and abandon us to our sins as evil suggests he will for God found a way to treat us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5743" display="1:35:43" %}} - as righteous without compromising his character and did so through the gift and sacrifice of his only son on our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5749" display="1:35:49" %}} - behalf there's that turning everything back to the cross again that's been that central theme here as it should be right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5755" display="1:35:55" %}} - when we discuss everything in the plan of God um so God didn't compromise his goodness and his love here because he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5762" display="1:36:02" %}} - forgave us but he did so justly he did so uh in concordance with Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5769" display="1:36:09" %}} - because Jesus actually paid the cost for our sins so again with the technical  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5774" display="1:36:14" %}} - vocabulary Mercy is the biblical name for God's policy of justly I going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5780" display="1:36:20" %}} - keep emphasizing that just forgiving us on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ we accept and receive God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5786" display="1:36:26" %}} - merciful offer of justification by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our savior um so uh this kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5793" display="1:36:33" %}} - of pulls to mind a a kind of a reasonably famous verse here in 1 John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5798" display="1:36:38" %}} - chapter one that talks about um how God is actually just to forgive us our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5803" display="1:36:43" %}} - when we confess here if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5809" display="1:36:49" %}} - all unrighteousness um I don't want to just keep harping on the same thing but what we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5815" display="1:36:55" %}} - is important um because uh I I think sometimes uh it's easy in uh our modern  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5823" display="1:37:03" %}} - times where we talk about how God is love um God is forgiveness we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5828" display="1:37:08" %}} - about all these things as maybe God just doesn't take sin seriously uh you know maybe he can just kind of wave his hand  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5834" display="1:37:14" %}} - and make it go away or whatever but that really isn't how we ought to think about it because sin is a deadly sin leads to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5841" display="1:37:21" %}} - death it's what the Bible says the wages of sin are death and it is really serious stuff because sin separates us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5847" display="1:37:27" %}} - from God and absent the blood of Christ that we know redeems us we would be dead in our sins eternally dead in our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5855" display="1:37:35" %}} - and so it's only because Jesus paid for that that God is able to justly forgive us of our sins um and so uh you know we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5864" display="1:37:44" %}} - might think of this as paying our debt on our behalf if sin puts us in debt then a just judge wouldn't let that debt  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5872" display="1:37:52" %}} - be forgiven without cause and Jesus uh the his payment for our sins upon the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5878" display="1:37:58" %}} - cross is that just cause that allows for the Forgiveness of our sins um that's kind of the emphasis here on God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5885" display="1:38:05" %}} - justice and this is why we should keep emphasizing uh how almost  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5892" display="1:38:12" %}} - um word's escaping me here it's just kind of how astounding the crosses in terms of what it reconciles what it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5898" display="1:38:18" %}} - means for God's love and his Mercy um and his justice to all be upheld by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5905" display="1:38:25" %}} - sacrifice that Jesus made on our behalf um is because God did all of this acting out of love but it also doesn't violate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5912" display="1:38:32" %}} - his his Justice it does not violate the need for uh sin to be paid for uh in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5919" display="1:38:39" %}} - order to be uh kind of the record set straight uh the the books balanced so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5925" display="1:38:45" %}} - speak um and again just to reemphasize that point that the only way in which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5931" display="1:38:51" %}} - our personal Ledger of sins and failures can be reset is to be washed personally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5937" display="1:38:57" %}} - in the blood of Christ and that only happens by us accepting and receiving Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5944" display="1:39:04" %}} - so uh that's how uh you know we accept God's Redemption his payment on our behalf that is how we are forgiven God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5951" display="1:39:11" %}} - can only forgive us his Justice only allows him to forgive us if we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5957" display="1:39:17" %}} - covered in the blood of Christ if we have accepted his payment otherwise he cannot pay for our sin um he cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5964" display="1:39:24" %}} - save those who are unwilling to be saved because his Justice simply doesn't allow it um so this is what we kind of are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5971" display="1:39:31" %}} - talking about when we say that God is just um and his Justice will not be denied um you know that's something we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5977" display="1:39:37" %}} - also get coming into uh the accounts of Revelation when Jesus returns in glory I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5983" display="1:39:43" %}} - think this is like Revelation chapter 19 picking up at like verses 11 see how good my memory is revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5990" display="1:39:50" %}} - 19 uh yeah so Heaven opens Jesus returns  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5997" display="1:39:57" %}} - and then hap then Armageddon happens right he completely Slaughters the enemies of wickedness so um that is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6004" display="1:40:04" %}} - Just Desserts of sinful unrepentant sinfulness and so we can be thankful to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6010" display="1:40:10" %}} - God that through the cross he's given us this way to avoid that fate um and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6015" display="1:40:15" %}} - is by submitting ourselves to God receiving his forgiveness on the basis of the death of his son  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6022" display="1:40:22" %}} - so a you have things to add here yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6028" display="1:40:28" %}} - um do I really have much to add is just his Justice is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6033" display="1:40:33" %}} - um um that's one of the things that Satan uh attacked as well we we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6039" display="1:40:39" %}} - notice that Satan was not interested in attacking God's nature that is what he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6047" display="1:40:47" %}} - is in terms of his abilities in terms terms of his power uh as God he was he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6056" display="1:40:56" %}} - was attacking God on the basis of his character that is what he attacked was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6061" display="1:41:01" %}} - God's character he doesn't love us enough to give us the things that are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6066" display="1:41:06" %}} - right for us to have he's denying us of things that are good for us to have and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6072" display="1:41:12" %}} - um if we do something about it he is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6078" display="1:41:18" %}} - just because if he acts Injustice he's going to violate something in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6085" display="1:41:25" %}} - character so he has to either tolerate sin which means he is not just or else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6092" display="1:41:32" %}} - he will be forced to do something that is actually uh in violation of that love  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6099" display="1:41:39" %}} - which will sort sort of um prove his point that God didn't love them all that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6104" display="1:41:44" %}} - much so if God tolerates sin he's not just if he um go goes after them and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6112" display="1:41:52" %}} - punishes them for what they have done then he demonstrates that he really didn't love them he didn't want them to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6118" display="1:41:58" %}} - have what was good for them to have um so God's justice is important and I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6125" display="1:42:05" %}} - think the the most important thing to note about Justice when we're talking in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6130" display="1:42:10" %}} - reference to kingship and in reference to rulership is that Justice underpins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6137" display="1:42:17" %}} - security if you don't if imagine in the home for example if children start to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6143" display="1:42:23" %}} - feel like um their parents don't they play  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6150" display="1:42:30" %}} - favorites if so and so does this he doesn't get the same thing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6157" display="1:42:37" %}} - everybody else gets so if he's mischievous the parents ignore the Mischief but if someone else is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6163" display="1:42:43" %}} - mischievous the person gets the weight of all punishment dropped on them um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6171" display="1:42:51" %}} - this person gets all the nice things the other person so we know what that does in the home it creates resentment and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6177" display="1:42:57" %}} - and stuff this is where Justice actually matters because it it underpins the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6184" display="1:43:04" %}} - peace the harmony the security in a system so if God is Not Just then God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6192" display="1:43:12" %}} - does not have the right to rule over moral creatures that's it and we feel the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6198" display="1:43:18" %}} - way about the Kings we have right now wherever whether it's a president or it's a governor or it's a mayor or like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6205" display="1:43:25" %}} - we have here local government chairman or whatever it is we expect fairness because without it we live in constant  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6214" display="1:43:34" %}} - misery so if God is not going to address  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6219" display="1:43:39" %}} - himself to sin rightly that means if sin is committed it has to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6226" display="1:43:46" %}} - punished and if someone does right the person should be rewarded if he does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6231" display="1:43:51" %}} - do that that's a moral argument for his loss of the right to rule over moral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6238" display="1:43:58" %}} - creatures yeah so of course where where I I I come at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6244" display="1:44:04" %}} - the argument a bit differently is that I don't really make a difference between Justice and love I I I see God's justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6250" display="1:44:10" %}} - as a demonstration of his love because if you love the people over whom  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6256" display="1:44:16" %}} - you rule you want to make sure they're at peace with each other and at peace  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6261" display="1:44:21" %}} - with you which means everyone gets what is their their due what is right right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6267" display="1:44:27" %}} - for them to have what is rightful for them to have so um the sense in which I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6273" display="1:44:33" %}} - would come at it is is something along the lines of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6280" display="1:44:40" %}} - because God is just he does not deny us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6285" display="1:44:45" %}} - of anything that is right for us to have he is absolutely fair to to all his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6290" display="1:44:50" %}} - moral creatures you might have heard in fact um earlier today I was watching a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6297" display="1:44:57" %}} - video um a discussion a debate between Alex o Conor uh also called The Cosmic  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6305" display="1:45:05" %}} - skeptic um uh on YouTube and Twitter uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6310" display="1:45:10" %}} - with Dr Jonathan M maachi or something I don't remember his son his soname too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6317" display="1:45:17" %}} - well so part of that debate was along the lines this was this was the argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6322" display="1:45:22" %}} - that Alex made Alex is an atheist it was like it seems that where you born  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6330" display="1:45:30" %}} - determines exactly what your disposition to God will be because this country is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6337" display="1:45:37" %}} - skewed this way that country is skewed that way and it's like well so it means I'm predisposed to be a Christian just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6343" display="1:45:43" %}} - because of where I born and that seems to be a mark on God you just you gave me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6349" display="1:45:49" %}} - a raw deal and if you gave me a raw deal exactly how are you worthy of my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6356" display="1:45:56" %}} - submitting to your Authority so again the question of justice is still addressing the fact that God um either  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6364" display="1:46:04" %}} - has or does not have the right to rule over us as moral creatures this is exactly the nature of the relationship  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6372" display="1:46:12" %}} - we have with God it's always a question of what we think of his right to rule over us some people come at that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6379" display="1:46:19" %}} - argument from thep Ive of wisdom as well um well uh if we are smart enough to do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6385" display="1:46:25" %}} - this and that and that and we don't need God to do it for us then why do we need him to rule over us you know but in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6391" display="1:46:31" %}} - particular case we're focused on Justice and the perspective of the Bible on that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6398" display="1:46:38" %}} - is everybody gets their due which which is when you read Ecclesiastes which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6404" display="1:46:44" %}} - probably the one book of the Bible that addresses the unbeliever although it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6410" display="1:46:50" %}} - it's actually more focused everything in the Bible is focused on the believer really and um even even Ecclesiastes is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6417" display="1:46:57" %}} - telling the believer this is what life really is about so don't waste your time pursuing this and that and the other but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6424" display="1:47:04" %}} - the unbeliever should be able to relate very strongly with what um Ecclesiastes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6429" display="1:47:09" %}} - says and at the end of it it says that God will reward everything that's done so that's also speaking to the justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6437" display="1:47:17" %}} - of God and we see the same thing in Revelation and even in the gospels where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6442" display="1:47:22" %}} - Jesus keeps promising that he is returning with his reward in his hand so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6447" display="1:47:27" %}} - the whole idea here is God saying look what you get is what is fair to you this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6455" display="1:47:35" %}} - is the truth whether it is a matter of the experiences we are having in this life the way our own tests have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6462" display="1:47:42" %}} - structured I don't get tested the way anybody else is tested and nobody else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6467" display="1:47:47" %}} - other people get tested in the way that I would will never be tested because I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6472" display="1:47:52" %}} - different and God addresses me as me he doesn't address me as if I was someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6478" display="1:47:58" %}} - else that's Justice and how does he deal with sin same thing across the board  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6486" display="1:48:06" %}} - Satan wanted to you know have his cake and eat it too we can do this and get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6492" display="1:48:12" %}} - away with it because God is not going to violate his love for us by carrying out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6498" display="1:48:18" %}} - his Justice against us but in fact love demands Justice that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6504" display="1:48:24" %}} - the thing and and like like the Bible says he corrupted his wisdom with his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6509" display="1:48:29" %}} - own wickedness so when his heart was um grew arrogant against God he became  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6514" display="1:48:34" %}} - incapable of seeing precisely how his wisdom had become foolishness if God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6522" display="1:48:42" %}} - loves he's going to be just now um when we sin there has to be Justice against  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6529" display="1:48:49" %}} - that sin but because God loves us he provides a way for us to be rescued from that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6536" display="1:48:56" %}} - judgment but that means he has to place something between his Justice and us so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6543" display="1:49:03" %}} - that his Justice is s is satisfied and we are spared and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6550" display="1:49:10" %}} - again is where the Cross of Christ comes in so we see that in all every time we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6556" display="1:49:16" %}} - talk about God's character for us believers of course for the Angels by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6563" display="1:49:23" %}} - extension we see that God's character is fully fully expressed and fully taught  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6571" display="1:49:31" %}} - to us through the sacrifice of Jesus because without that sacrifice God could  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6578" display="1:49:38" %}} - not carry out his Justice against sin and still Save The Sinner so yeah yes I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6586" display="1:49:46" %}} - think one thing to just elaborate on here a couple points is that first of all God's justice is in stark contrast  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6593" display="1:49:53" %}} - to what the world calls Justice Audi brought up a couple examples here of how God uh judges us perfectly at the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6599" display="1:49:59" %}} - individual level which is something that human Justice systems cannot do at least completely properly I mean we can do our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6605" display="1:50:05" %}} - best um but even if our rulers are imperfect in their application of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6610" display="1:50:10" %}} - justice so for example they might favor the rich and Powerful uh that has been a characterization of so-called Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6618" display="1:50:18" %}} - systems throughout all history is well if you enough money and power you can kind of wiggle your way out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6624" display="1:50:24" %}} - consequences under the law right not so with God though um so that's one point in God's justice when we say God is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6631" display="1:50:31" %}} - we mean it um in all circumstances part of this comes with God being all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6637" display="1:50:37" %}} - powerful is that God has the capability to enforce Justice um so uh you might  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6643" display="1:50:43" %}} - have heard of of people called enforcers in gains right uh this is not a label we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6649" display="1:50:49" %}} - would apply to God per se but um God has the ab the ability he has the power to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6656" display="1:50:56" %}} - carry that sword to ensure that Justice is Meed out effectively um and this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6663" display="1:51:03" %}} - no small thing because um if the other guy has a bigger stick than you how are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6668" display="1:51:08" %}} - you going to hold him to Justice right um but God will God wins in the end you know we've mentioned this Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6674" display="1:51:14" %}} - chapter 19 when Jesus returns the world will face God's righteous judgment and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6679" display="1:51:19" %}} - no one will able to stand against God um so that's one important Point another thing so AI had mentioned kind of about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6685" display="1:51:25" %}} - how a lot of the satanic rebellion was the skepticism that God really loves uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6690" display="1:51:30" %}} - because if God loved us why wouldn't he give us these things that we think we want right that are good for us in our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6695" display="1:51:35" %}} - opinion um well people doubt God too you know another reason why people uh have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6702" display="1:51:42" %}} - shall we say less than uh uh happy thoughts about God or you know Desiring  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6708" display="1:51:48" %}} - to go after him is that they view God as fundamentally unfair um so you brought up that point about well what happens if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6715" display="1:51:55" %}} - you're born in such and such culture such and such life circumstances doesn't that put you to disadvantage right I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6720" display="1:52:00" %}} - brought up on the screen when you're talking about that I brought up Romans 1 famous passage about natural Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6726" display="1:52:06" %}} - which we've talked about says that everybody knows that God exists from that which has been created so truly people are without excuse to begin with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6732" display="1:52:12" %}} - but even in those circumstances in which people are born uh maybe into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6738" display="1:52:18" %}} - household with less money less education less opportunity God knows all these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6743" display="1:52:23" %}} - things and because he perfectly knows our circumstances Justice will be perfect um so I all of this I you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6751" display="1:52:31" %}} - kind of preaching into the choir I'm assuming but when we say God is just we are talking from a kind of divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6757" display="1:52:37" %}} - theological point of view in a way that human Justice systems cannot match um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6763" display="1:52:43" %}} - and uh this is kind of what we mean when this entire lesson we're going through is about God's perfect character um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6770" display="1:52:50" %}} - human systems that are you know some sort of attempted mirror on uh uh God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6776" display="1:52:56" %}} - moral Divine Law God's justice are only imperfect representations um but God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6782" display="1:53:02" %}} - justice is actually complete so uh any any more thoughts there or shall we go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6789" display="1:53:09" %}} - on to the next one yeah I believe we can I actually I have a something to bring  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6795" display="1:53:15" %}} - up regarding that so I recently um was speaking to a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6802" display="1:53:22" %}} - friend of mine and W witnessing to her and um she's an unbeliever so she  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6808" display="1:53:28" %}} - brought up God's justice and basically what she said was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6814" display="1:53:34" %}} - um she didn't under she didn't understand and she's being perfectly honest like I believe I believe in her  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6820" display="1:53:40" %}} - when she said that she's like I really don't understand when people say Jesus died on the cross for my sins I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6827" display="1:53:47" %}} - she says I don't understand what that means so I tried to explain it to her um but she basically her argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6835" display="1:53:55" %}} - was why should I even be punished eternally for sins that I commit when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6841" display="1:54:01" %}} - I'm like I only live to be like 80 years old or 90 years old why should I be condemned eternally for like when my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6849" display="1:54:09" %}} - lifespan is only you know tiny compared to Eternity so her  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6855" display="1:54:15" %}} - her so she said from the very get-go God is unjust because I because I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6861" display="1:54:21" %}} - deserve hell why should I accept Christ's sacrifice why should even accept God's offer of forgiveness  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6868" display="1:54:28" %}} - for a punish that I don't deserve in the first place it's not necessarily I'm good enough to get into heaven it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6875" display="1:54:35" %}} - I'm not bad enough to go H the idea kind of different the idea here being that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6881" display="1:54:41" %}} - temporal actions have eternal consequences and that is the the point of attack is that correct yes correct  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6889" display="1:54:49" %}} - all all right aie you want to you want to take a step at this one first I mean I certainly have thoughts but uh you can go first I'll follow okay so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6898" display="1:54:58" %}} - I mean fundamentally with regards to this one of the things to understand is that God is eternal perfect right that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6905" display="1:55:05" %}} - one of the things we understand about God's perfect character so to take that Romans one passage that we brought up um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6912" display="1:55:12" %}} - you know basically we the reason why um and I think probably the root of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6918" display="1:55:18" %}} - misunderstanding is that hell is not to punish us right unfortunately this has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6923" display="1:55:23" %}} - permeated cultural understanding of hell for a very long time you know I I'd say even among Evangelical Christians among  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6929" display="1:55:29" %}} - people who take the Bible seriously take inherency inspiration seriously a lot of people still think that God sends people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6935" display="1:55:35" %}} - to hell to punish them the only reason you are sent to hell um Jesus paid for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6942" display="1:55:42" %}} - the sin of all on the cross right there's this teaching in theology uh so-called Double Jeopardy right if God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6948" display="1:55:48" %}} - judged Jesus for sins then if God judges people for those sins in Hell well the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6954" display="1:55:54" %}} - sins are being judged twice you see um and the misunderstanding here is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6959" display="1:55:59" %}} - human beings are not qualified to pay for sin um this is why the Bible goes on and on about Jesus being the lamb  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6966" display="1:56:06" %}} - without blemish a perfect sacrifice that's why he had to be fully God yet fully man to pay for our sin Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6973" display="1:56:13" %}} - the only person who has ever lived and ever will live who could pay for sin who was qualified to pay for sin human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6980" display="1:56:20" %}} - beings are not qualified to pay for sin because we are ourselves stained we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6985" display="1:56:25" %}} - in like unworthy sacrifices but more to this question specifically if you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6991" display="1:56:31" %}} - view hell any longer as a way to punish human beings hell is simply the lack of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6998" display="1:56:38" %}} - acceptance of Jesus Christ the lack of this Redemption for sin then um I just I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7005" display="1:56:45" %}} - I feel like pun the punishment angle really gets in a gets in the way of people appreciating this point right when the Bible says that the only sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7012" display="1:56:52" %}} - that cannot be forgiven is unbelief or blasphemy against the Holy Spirit which of course I this takes to be unbelief um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7020" display="1:57:00" %}} - that is people end up in hell because of that right because they choose not to accept God's uh God's offering his olive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7028" display="1:57:08" %}} - branch of forgiveness um so I don't know if maybe if I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7034" display="1:57:14" %}} - getting to the underlying root cause of temporal versus eternity but this kind of explains why human beings can't pay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7040" display="1:57:20" %}} - for their sin aside from Jesus Christ um I mean you want to clarify it all I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7046" display="1:57:26" %}} - mean ises that help or do we need to talk more about well I think the whole okay so like she's coming from a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7053" display="1:57:33" %}} - just to give you a background on her she's um really ended Theos gnosticism where she she like when she I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7060" display="1:57:40" %}} - was explained to her about Adam and Eve and how like death came into the world from sin and her perspective is well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7067" display="1:57:47" %}} - Adam and Eve were were perfect and they needed to sin in order to grow and become like God so she's got this like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7075" display="1:57:55" %}} - like not like this view where sin is not you need sin to grow like she will never  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7080" display="1:58:00" %}} - grow or be Sanctified unless well unless she makes mistakes and learns from them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7085" display="1:58:05" %}} - yeah and don't agree but right I know like I know but like I think she's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7091" display="1:58:11" %}} - viewing like I can see her perspective like if you're a like a regular human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7096" display="1:58:16" %}} - being and you've never raped someone murdered someone like if I mean you sin but you've never really really hurt  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7103" display="1:58:23" %}} - someone I can see where someone is like why you know other than like maybe Cara like oh I kind of like I was mean to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7110" display="1:58:30" %}} - this person today so then maybe someone's mean to me three days later why should I why do I need someone to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7116" display="1:58:36" %}} - die for me that that that's like why how are my sins so bad that I commit on this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7122" display="1:58:42" %}} - you know on this planet while I'm here so bad that I need someone to actually like be put to death for me that I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7129" display="1:58:49" %}} - that's where she's coming from yeah I I when my niece um one of my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7137" display="1:58:57" %}} - nieces my brother's children when they were here with with us uh we were having  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7142" display="1:59:02" %}} - prayer session um one of our um morning prayer sessions and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7148" display="1:59:08" %}} - I I was trying to make a point and I asked whether I was asking each of them um do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7156" display="1:59:16" %}} - you have you ever sinned have you ever done anything wrong because I wanted to explain something about the cross and my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7164" display="1:59:24" %}} - niece my brother's oldest daughter actually said no she' never done anything wrong and I was like I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7171" display="1:59:31" %}} - she's six so but I was so I mean I don't I don't think I had heard that in a long  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7178" display="1:59:38" %}} - time that there was anyone who actually thought I've never done anything wrong I thought that was quite amazing to hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7185" display="1:59:45" %}} - from anybody right but um some some people really just don't count the big  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7192" display="1:59:52" %}} - things like as long as I'm not doing yeah the Small Things They don't count the small things so as long as I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7198" display="1:59:58" %}} - doing some of those big things I've never raped never killed basically never murdered anyone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7204" display="2:00:04" %}} - and I've never um committed robbery if I pilfered it's just pilfering it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7210" display="2:00:10" %}} - that big of a deal if I told a white lie was just telling a white light it's not like I actually went out there and and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7217" display="2:00:17" %}} - defamed someone or sland someone or something like that so if it's all these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7222" display="2:00:22" %}} - small things well everybody does it can't be that bad it's not bad it's just it's just part of life and I mean I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7230" display="2:00:30" %}} - imagine someone thinking that way but I don't think I have come across anyone recently that has actually said it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7238" display="2:00:38" %}} - except for my six-year-old niece which was pretty interesting and when people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7243" display="2:00:43" %}} - say that if they would ever say it to my face I would tell them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7251" display="2:00:51" %}} - yeah if you were the one judging like if you were the lawgiver the law maker then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7259" display="2:00:59" %}} - I would say you have a point because you define what is right and wrong but since  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7264" display="2:01:04" %}} - you're not the one defining it and you're the one responding to the definition yeah I don't think I'm going  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7270" display="2:01:10" %}} - to take your word for it that's just the fact of it the Bible is actually pretty clear that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7276" display="2:01:16" %}} - himself this is job that God found fault  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7281" display="2:01:21" %}} - with his holy ones referring to the angels and that some that was something that didn't register very well with me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7286" display="2:01:26" %}} - until I think it was even probably within the past few weeks that the thing that the import of that statement hit me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7293" display="2:01:33" %}} - which was essentially this Satan was smart enough that what he crafted seemed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7299" display="2:01:39" %}} - to be full proof that no one could find fault with it not even God that was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7305" display="2:01:45" %}} - idea that God could not accuse him of sin in what he had just done he had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7310" display="2:01:50" %}} - basically essentially trapped God in a logical contradiction so how was God going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7316" display="2:01:56" %}} - accuse him of sin that's what he thought he had accomplished and that's the arrogance of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7323" display="2:02:03" %}} - sin I I think one thing I want to Pivot to when we talk about this too is there's the implicit assumption here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7329" display="2:02:09" %}} - that this punishment for like basically punishment fitting the crime is unjust  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7334" display="2:02:14" %}} - um if you view that as a presupposition um this kind of comes into the Audie and I had briefly touched on this I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7340" display="2:02:20" %}} - remember exactly when in our discussion of these things basically something good because God said it's good or is does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7348" display="2:02:28" %}} - God just happen to conform to I don't know goodness and Justice floating about there this in philosophy this is called  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7354" display="2:02:34" %}} - the uer a dilemma um basically is it good and just because God wills it or does God will it because it's good and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7359" display="2:02:39" %}} - just I I don't you know for a lot of the time I think this is a pedantic distinction uh in practice however with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7366" display="2:02:46" %}} - regards to this question basically the Bible is pretty clear I pulled up this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7371" display="2:02:51" %}} - this verse here Romans chapter 6 saying that the wages of sin is death that's very clear in Genesis chapter uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7378" display="2:02:58" %}} - early chapters of Genesis that um the the price for sin is death right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7383" display="2:03:03" %}} - through through sin death came into the world sort of thing Romans chapter 5 talks about this as well contrasting how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7389" display="2:03:09" %}} - death came into the world through Adam with how reconciliation and uh I I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7395" display="2:03:15" %}} - go pull up the context in Romans chapter 5 but how basically Jesus does what came through Adam right and and uh the many  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7402" display="2:03:22" %}} - are saved through the actions of the one in Jesus um so where I'm going with all of this is that the Bible pretty clearly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7409" display="2:03:29" %}} - and unequivocally teaches that you know the the consequences of sin is death and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7416" display="2:03:36" %}} - separation from God um and so if someone comes to us and says well that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7422" display="2:03:42" %}} - unjust on where are they getting their their standard of Justice from right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7429" display="2:03:49" %}} - you know basically because of the Bible teaches this and see this is one of those things where um it can be tricky  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7435" display="2:03:55" %}} - to be convincing in an apologetic fashion in an intellectual fashion to someone who doesn't want to believe um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7441" display="2:04:01" %}} - so if you say how this argument would work for us as a Christian probably goes something like the Bible clearly teaches  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7447" display="2:04:07" %}} - that uh the consequences of sin is death um so not just physical death but spiritual death separation from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7453" display="2:04:13" %}} - leading to Eternal and or second death is what we would call it um that's the consequence of sin right and we all sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7460" display="2:04:20" %}} - Romans 3:23 says that James 3:2 says that therefore absent uh accepting Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7466" display="2:04:26" %}} - Christ as our Lord and savior that is the Eternal Destiny of all of us because all of us sin that's the consequences of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7472" display="2:04:32" %}} - sin um where people get hung up is they say well murder is a quote unquote worse sin than white lies or something like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7480" display="2:04:40" %}} - that but fundamentally the the sin that we speak of here all of that has this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7485" display="2:04:45" %}} - consequence of separating us from God um and so for people who believe the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7492" display="2:04:52" %}} - the verses I just quoted get you right there right but for people who don't believe the Bible it's going to seem  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7498" display="2:04:58" %}} - like so much nonsense because they're not looking with eyes of Faith they don't have that spiritual perspective um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7506" display="2:05:06" %}} - so a rejection of God and it's it's kind of like if if you want to eat at my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7511" display="2:05:11" %}} - dinner table you're going to have to take your shoes off and come into my house and sit down and if you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7517" display="2:05:17" %}} - choose to do that take your shoes off you oh that's not fair I want to eat with my shoes on then you know I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7524" display="2:05:24" %}} - going to let you at my dinner table and it's the same thing it's a just rejection of the person of God it and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7531" display="2:05:31" %}} - them deciding know I'm going to do it my way which is fun with me go eat wherever you want but you're not gonna eat a my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7536" display="2:05:36" %}} - tape that's how God is looking at that's an amazing analogy actually that's like a really good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7542" display="2:05:42" %}} - analogy well if you want no part in God if you say you want no part in God and everything good comes through God I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7549" display="2:05:49" %}} - we believe that as Christians it's self- selected right but where I'm going with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7554" display="2:05:54" %}} - this sometimes is it's really tricky this is why it's a spiritual gift apologetics is a spiritual gift how do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7560" display="2:06:00" %}} - we craft these things in a way that's Winsome for the gospel without alienating our audience but we yet we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7567" display="2:06:07" %}} - not compromising on the truth and I don't know I like I will confess you know even though I think Dr lugan Bill  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7574" display="2:06:14" %}} - is actually rather Adept at it when he does engage in what I would term apolog and I don't consider myself completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7580" display="2:06:20" %}} - terrible at it either it's just not where my strength is so I can give you the biblical argument I I laid out kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7587" display="2:06:27" %}} - just back of the napkin sort of argument that I just gave you but when it comes to someone who will just reject that out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7593" display="2:06:33" %}} - of hand and say well I I just I don't like I don't believe that right I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7599" display="2:06:39" %}} - have your assumptions I I I'm not willing to just listen to what the Bible says how do you convince them that what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7605" display="2:06:45" %}} - we're talking about is just uh that God has the moral Authority that's what we've been talking about in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7611" display="2:06:51" %}} - sovereignty that this is how he structured the Justice in the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7616" display="2:06:56" %}} - that sinning against an infinitely uh just and holy God leads to Eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7621" display="2:07:01" %}} - consequences if someone doubts the justice of that what can you say to them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7627" display="2:07:07" %}} - in an apologetics context I mean good question off the top of my head I can't give you an answer that I that I would  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7633" display="2:07:13" %}} - assume they would find convincing and I think it's important to note that they might not find anything convincing this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7638" display="2:07:18" %}} - point right right you know because something that I thought of too like like and I thought I kind of thought of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7644" display="2:07:24" %}} - this after the fact after I talked to her like maybe if I talk to her again I'll bring it up but you know we we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7650" display="2:07:30" %}} - live forever too like God doesn't destroy us we don't go to Oblivion we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7655" display="2:07:35" %}} - like God created us to be forever so yeah so when we do sin it's not yeah we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7662" display="2:07:42" %}} - we sinned while we were on this Earth but it's still like kind of like an ET  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7667" display="2:07:47" %}} - not eternal being sinning but I mean I mean I could see that part of it and then also like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7674" display="2:07:54" %}} - you see all the evil in the world and you see where sin leads like the wickedness of men and then I don't know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7680" display="2:08:00" %}} - about you guys but when I sin like when I like yell at my mom and dad or lose my temper or something I can see like I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7687" display="2:08:07" %}} - feel that emotion in me and I can see how like if it wasn't checked how it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7693" display="2:08:13" %}} - could eventually turn into that wickedness and yeah and all of us too like you have no idea how much Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7700" display="2:08:20" %}} - Spirit restraint is on our lives like like the difference between a person who you know grew up in a loving family who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7707" display="2:08:27" %}} - like maybe when they get angry at their parents like you know nothing bad happens whereas maybe a difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7712" display="2:08:32" %}} - between a person who had abusive parents like really abusive parents they get angry at their parents they might end up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7718" display="2:08:38" %}} - killing or hurting their parents like something like that where so yeah like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7724" display="2:08:44" %}} - even though we like it seems like we make we do small sins that don't have a big consequence like those small sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7730" display="2:08:50" %}} - and just that act of sinning the evilness is like in there you know what I'm saying like it's yeah well and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7737" display="2:08:57" %}} - is why this is why I was trying to emphasize that when you take the punishment equation out of hell because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7743" display="2:09:03" %}} - fundamentally the only reason why people go to hell is not because of sin it's because right they reject Christ's uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7750" display="2:09:10" %}} - off you know God's offer of Salvation suddenly this my sins are less bad than  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7755" display="2:09:15" %}} - that other person's sins goes completely out the window because that's not why anyone Goes to Hell right yeah now I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7760" display="2:09:20" %}} - will say that I can't speak for other Christians it's uncomfortable when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7766" display="2:09:26" %}} - when we teach about the scandalousness of Grace right the whole if Hitler repented would he have gone to heaven  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7771" display="2:09:31" %}} - sort of thing biblically speaking salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ look at Paul who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7777" display="2:09:37" %}} - persecuted the early church I'm sure there were people in the early church who were not happy with God in God's uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7783" display="2:09:43" %}} - justice you know they probably put Justice in scare quotes who were offended by by the fact that God chose  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7789" display="2:09:49" %}} - to use Paul as the Apostle of the Gentiles right the one who had persecuted the church um but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7798" display="2:09:58" %}} - we're getting right back to you know every single person is uh worthy of that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7805" display="2:10:05" %}} - condemnation right and so this idea that we want people who uh you know committed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7812" display="2:10:12" %}} - all these really terrible things in life to be punished more I mean people that computes in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7818" display="2:10:18" %}} - terms of people's justice but this is this is when we say Jesus died for the sins of the world it is what makes that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7825" display="2:10:25" %}} - so scandalous um is that absolutely no one deserves that that sort of redemption um go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7833" display="2:10:33" %}} - ahead yeah I I mean um what you said uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7839" display="2:10:39" %}} - there was something you said I wanted to get in on but I think something else was overtaken it if anyone is really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7845" display="2:10:45" %}} - measuring themselves against other people I would okay yeah it was what you said about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7851" display="2:10:51" %}} - Paul um that was it and I think that was a very very good uh point to make even  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7860" display="2:11:00" %}} - ananas who was sent by the Lord to give Paul the gospel was reluctant to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7867" display="2:11:07" %}} - because of how unfair he felt it was this is the man who's been murdering us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7873" display="2:11:13" %}} - and you want me to go and preach life to him so that he will be saved yeah that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7881" display="2:11:21" %}} - doesn't seem fair and we might remember was the same position that Jona  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7887" display="2:11:27" %}} - took so um but you see each of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7893" display="2:11:33" %}} - things whether it's the it's the question of how we think our own sins stack up against what what really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7900" display="2:11:40" %}} - matters in terms of what must be called sin and how we stack up against other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7906" display="2:11:46" %}} - people it's still missing the point point we're making ourselves the definition of the law we are saying if I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7914" display="2:11:54" %}} - think it's bad then it's bad if I don't think it's bad then it's not bad what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7921" display="2:12:01" %}} - how how does that compute in our minds in the eyes of the Lord the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7927" display="2:12:07" %}} - smallest sin is no different than the greatest sin that's it and the reason we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7934" display="2:12:14" %}} - get that is that we don't know what sin is where God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7941" display="2:12:21" %}} - concerned sin is a rejection of his right to rule and exist as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7949" display="2:12:29" %}} - God it's a rejection of him of his own very self if he were a creature like us sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7956" display="2:12:36" %}} - would be murdering him because it it denies the essence of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7962" display="2:12:42" %}} - being sin is not just something that um like it's not not cosmetic at all it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7969" display="2:12:49" %}} - cosmic failure we look at it as a small thing but it is actually an infraction of an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7977" display="2:12:57" %}} - infinite Justice we have violated the justice of an infinite God which means  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7983" display="2:13:03" %}} - we have done something that is infinite in its very nature but because we are confined in this state where we know our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7990" display="2:13:10" %}} - lives are measured in days that take by and we are we are the the the effect of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7998" display="2:13:18" %}} - the things we do don't seem to Ripple that far it's like why is it that big of a deal but it's not about us it's about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8006" display="2:13:26" %}} - the person that says do not do or that said do that's the person that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8013" display="2:13:33" %}} - that's the standard of Justice that's the person we are measuring against and when we did something that violated his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8021" display="2:13:41" %}} - Justice that thing is measured by his Justice not by us so there is no small  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8027" display="2:13:47" %}} - sin in the the eyes of the Lord if the only sin that was ever committed in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8032" display="2:13:52" %}} - human history was one small white lie it would have still taken the cross of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8039" display="2:13:59" %}} - Jesus Christ to save the person who committed it even if that's the only thing they ever  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8045" display="2:14:05" %}} - did so there is there is no small sin in the eyes of the Lord whether it's big or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8051" display="2:14:11" %}} - small is only measured by us in terms of how it affects those around us and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8057" display="2:14:17" %}} - is a very small measure really it's about consequences you know this is why this is such a tricky I pulled up uh on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8064" display="2:14:24" %}} - the screen by the way the ichus has a we will get to it if we continue doing um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8070" display="2:14:30" %}} - Bible basics you know hom mariology the study of sin there's a lot to it right I'm not saying oh you have to go read  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8076" display="2:14:36" %}} - 500 pages otherwise you don't really understand sin but the point we're making here is that this is a worthy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8083" display="2:14:43" %}} - conversation to have um about what is sin um what are the effects of it how does it separate us from God how does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8090" display="2:14:50" %}} - God forgive sin the mechanics of it um all of that um but I will say and again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8096" display="2:14:56" %}} - I I tried to emphasize this earlier even if what we're saying doesn't come off as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8101" display="2:15:01" %}} - uh convincing to people that doesn't mean we shouldn't say it um you know so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8107" display="2:15:07" %}} - uh there there may be this tendency to feel like we have to win arguments it's not about winning arguments it's about sharing the truth right and when we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8116" display="2:15:16" %}} - that uh when we sin against a a perfect infinite just God it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8121" display="2:15:21" %}} - has infinite consequences and someone scoffs and said well why I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8126" display="2:15:26" %}} - understand that I don't get that that doesn't seem fair to me it's not our job to change their mind per se we present  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8133" display="2:15:33" %}} - what the Bible teaches and then we let the chips fall where they may I mean obviously some people are called to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8139" display="2:15:39" %}} - engage more or less than others but um I I I think we've covered a good bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8144" display="2:15:44" %}} - of ground here I don't know you tell us Abby are there more facets to this you want to go over or um not right now I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8151" display="2:15:51" %}} - mean there's there's a lot we talked about so many things we talked a long time but um I'll bring up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8158" display="2:15:58" %}} - more things later okay great yeah you guys did a good job on this so this is one of those challenges to God's justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8165" display="2:16:05" %}} - that we think about um people I mean people have a hard time with it you know the problem of evil just generally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8170" display="2:16:10" %}} - speaking not even talking about uh the the this justice of sin or people's perceived lack thereof but just you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8178" display="2:16:18" %}} - why aren't evil people punished more um you know how how can evil exist in the world if God is just Etc um people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8187" display="2:16:27" %}} - question God's justice they have they doubt it and they because of that they say I can't follow such a God right if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8194" display="2:16:34" %}} - God's really like that then he's not for me um it's a very real issue in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8199" display="2:16:39" %}} - church but again fundamentally we can only do our best presenting the truth as the Bible teaches it but we can't force  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8206" display="2:16:46" %}} - people to believe it um and so if people are determined in their minds to have such a low opinion of God and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8213" display="2:16:53" %}} - Justice that they won't even consider how some of these things might work or or how what the Bible says is actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8219" display="2:16:59" %}} - true there's not a lot we can do to make them do that um all right well good conversation so I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8227" display="2:17:07" %}} - think this is where we'll cut our discussion of God being just and we'll pick up with the last one in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8233" display="2:17:13" %}} - particular lesson talking how God is life in just a moment here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8241" display="2:17:21" %}} - so finishing off uh kind of how God's qualities manifest in creation we're going to be talking about life now um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8248" display="2:17:28" %}} - this perhaps is one of the more abstract consequences here when we say that God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8254" display="2:17:34" %}} - truth leads to life sometimes people are like well I would seems like even people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8261" display="2:17:41" %}} - who are you know buying into lies are still alive right I think um part of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8266" display="2:17:46" %}} - what might help understand understand this is when we talk about uh spiritual truth right the truth about who Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8272" display="2:17:52" %}} - and what he did um Jesus says um you know he talking about uh the bread that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8279" display="2:17:59" %}} - comes down from heaven this is John chapter 6 Jesus as the bread of life this is what sustains us as Christians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8286" display="2:18:06" %}} - not even physical food I mean it's a metaphor of course but you know the idea being that uh we man you know also when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8294" display="2:18:14" %}} - Jesus is tested uh Jesus quotes scripture saying man does not live on uh bread alone but upon every worth that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8300" display="2:18:20" %}} - comes from God um not paraphrasing but happens during the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness um this is what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8307" display="2:18:27" %}} - mean by truth is what gives us life um you might also think of uh John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8312" display="2:18:32" %}} - 4 uh with the woman at the Samaritan woman at the well I'm talking about living water that's the truth that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8319" display="2:18:39" %}} - Springs up within us giving us life um this is all over the place in the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8326" display="2:18:46" %}} - so as I say maybe it's a little bit harder to wrap our heads around this one in particular when we say well how does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8332" display="2:18:52" %}} - truth give us life um in fact by just going from the Gospel of John here in John chapter 8 um uh truth will set you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8340" display="2:19:00" %}} - free there's another another verse that talks about how um you will be free indeed right if you believe in the truth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8346" display="2:19:06" %}} - if you abide in the word of God the truth will set you free and uh truly how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8352" display="2:19:12" %}} - we think about this is that are we really living if our lives are in shackles and bondage right we don't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8360" display="2:19:20" %}} - real life we don't have uh an actual appreciation for what living means until  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8365" display="2:19:25" %}} - we submit ourselves to God and we do the things that he would have of us because that's the only time when we are actually truly free as humans um so all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8373" display="2:19:33" %}} - of this to say this idea of uh the God is life and the life that he gives us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8380" display="2:19:40" %}} - being firmly cemented in uh God being truth right God being uh uh filled by uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8387" display="2:19:47" %}} - truth and faithfulness this is God's aspect of his character manifesting in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8393" display="2:19:53" %}} - True Life in this world right Freedom leaving on the words that come from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8399" display="2:19:59" %}} - that speak to the life the Salvation that we have in Christ Jesus um as we talked about in John chapter 6 John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8405" display="2:20:05" %}} - chapter 4 um and other passages besides in the New Testament this is kind of what we're talking about here so again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8411" display="2:20:11" %}} - going to read some of the ichus passages here um so uh I'll read some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8417" display="2:20:17" %}} - paragraph and then we'll go from there as we have the last couple of times so when we talk about God's life we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8423" display="2:20:23" %}} - saving the lives of his creatures is a natural consequence of God's truth and faithfulness so out of the intrinsic  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8429" display="2:20:29" %}} - veracity and trustworthiness of his character God honors his gracious and merciful promise to restore us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8435" display="2:20:35" %}} - himself and thereby to eternal life delivering us from the condemnation of death accre to us in our sinful state so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8442" display="2:20:42" %}} - we say that he is faithful to that promise he made right recognize these words gracious corresponding to love and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8449" display="2:20:49" %}} - merciful corresponding to Justice when God promised to restore us to himself as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8454" display="2:20:54" %}} - he did Adam and Eve in the Proto evangelium that giving of animal skins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8459" display="2:20:59" %}} - to Adam and Eve in the garden at the end of Genesis chapter 3 God kept that promise he redeemed them from Death the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8466" display="2:21:06" %}} - consequence of their sin um right the condemnation of death occuring to us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8471" display="2:21:11" %}} - our sinful State we just talked about this we spent a long time talking about how the consequences of sin or death  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8477" display="2:21:17" %}} - even Eternal death and separation from God so in doing so he has not failed to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8483" display="2:21:23" %}} - resolve the competing demands of his goodness and love on the one hand with those of his Holiness and Justice on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8489" display="2:21:29" %}} - other as evil suggests he must and again tying it back to the Cross we say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8494" display="2:21:34" %}} - this is because God has found a way in accordance with his character to eliminate the wall of sin and consequent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8501" display="2:21:41" %}} - wrath which separates us from him he has taken down the barrier of Separation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8507" display="2:21:47" %}} - that separates Humanity from himself and he's done so through the gift and sacrifice of his only son on our behalf  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8514" display="2:21:54" %}} - meaning that Jesus died and was judged in our place that we might have life um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8520" display="2:22:00" %}} - and so peace that other technical term here Shalom IR in Greek peace is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8526" display="2:22:06" %}} - biblical name for God's life-giving policy of reconciling us to himself on the basis of the work of Jesus Christ we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8533" display="2:22:13" %}} - accept and receive God's offer of Life peace and Reconciliation by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8539" display="2:22:19" %}} - our savior so no different than um how we receive forgiveness how we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8546" display="2:22:26" %}} - justified by accepting Jesus Christ and how we receive God's Redemption by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8551" display="2:22:31" %}} - accepting Jesus Christ so we are reconciled to God through our belief in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8556" display="2:22:36" %}} - Jesus Christ and what he did for us um so uh hopefully that's a good enough  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8563" display="2:22:43" %}} - introduction here to get us talking about the subject here um but this idea of our fullness of life that we have um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8571" display="2:22:51" %}} - I think you might uh consider the passages in Scripture that talk about peace and joy these are characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8577" display="2:22:57" %}} - that we ought to possess as Christians uh that true life living in the power of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8583" display="2:23:03" %}} - the spirit that we ought to have by following Jesus Christ is that we ought to be set free from the shackles and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8589" display="2:23:09" %}} - bondage that characterize those who are enslaved to sin because we have the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8595" display="2:23:15" %}} - Spirit living within us that that springing up to us as a well of living water based upon the truth in the word  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8601" display="2:23:21" %}} - of God that is what we mean by the life that God gives us that peace and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8606" display="2:23:26" %}} - Reconciliation to him that we have through his truth um so uh a you want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8613" display="2:23:33" %}} - pick up from there yeah um get cut off yeah I think I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8620" display="2:23:40" %}} - started talking but I don't hearing H yeah uh how about could you contrast  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8626" display="2:23:46" %}} - life eternal life life with eternal death hear everyone but it doesn't seem like you can hear can you hear me okay I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8632" display="2:23:52" %}} - can hear you now yeah so Lisa just asked a question uh didn't mean it cut off what you were saying but it's a good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8638" display="2:23:58" %}} - question so you want to say something and then we handle it or you want to just jump straight into the question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8643" display="2:24:03" %}} - uh well okay he seems to be having connection problems here Soh I tell you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8650" display="2:24:10" %}} - what aie um I'm G to go ahead and talk and answer Lisa's question and uh if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8656" display="2:24:16" %}} - can sort out the ction problems will certainly give you the mic at the earliest convenience so Lisa's question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8663" display="2:24:23" %}} - here was um can we contrast life with spiritual life with spiritual death um I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8669" display="2:24:29" %}} - think kind of as it relates to what we've been talking about here uh fundamentally spiritual death  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8675" display="2:24:35" %}} - corresponds with with lies it corresponds with not believing the truth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8681" display="2:24:41" %}} - of what Jesus has done for the world um and um I think this kind of gets back  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8686" display="2:24:46" %}} - into what we were talking about with uh God's forgiveness of our sins uh being just uh is that when God gives us life  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8695" display="2:24:55" %}} - he does so um out of out of Truth out of his faithful promise to restore us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8701" display="2:25:01" %}} - himself um he he he doesn't do it just because he arbitrarily promises things but there's weight behind the promises  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8708" display="2:25:08" %}} - of God because of his character because he's perfect and so when he promises to do something that thing is sure and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8715" display="2:25:15" %}} - certain it's not like humans who can be kind of flaky sometimes when God says he's going to do something God will do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8721" display="2:25:21" %}} - it and he does it not arbitrarily you know it's not like he promised to do it and therefore he did it even though it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8727" display="2:25:27" %}} - not fair he did it on the basis of his sacrifice so okay Lisa's question about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8732" display="2:25:32" %}} - contrasting this to spiritual death when we live um a life kind of infected by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8738" display="2:25:38" %}} - death infected by sin um you know our sin nature within us we are separate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8744" display="2:25:44" %}} - from God and part of this life that we're talking about here is not uh people would take this and this is I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8750" display="2:25:50" %}} - don't want to say just an English thing I I bet the connotation very across language but we are really talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8756" display="2:25:56" %}} - fullness of Life on that Hebrew word that we're talking about here Shalom is more than just being alive it's more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8763" display="2:26:03" %}} - than just consuming air in your lungs and eating food and sleeping and our bodily functions as humans it is like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8770" display="2:26:10" %}} - the idea of truly living of having that peace that reconciliation between us and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8775" display="2:26:15" %}} - God and when you think about it unbelievers who are dead in their sins are dead men walking they don't have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8783" display="2:26:23" %}} - quickening of the Holy Spirit to give meaning to their lives um I know I talked about this I have that other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8789" display="2:26:29" %}} - series up on my site going through uh sr4 Satan's World System talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8794" display="2:26:34" %}} - the vanity of the world one of the benefits we have as Christians is that everything we do has Eternal meaning and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8801" display="2:26:41" %}} - purpose behind it we are working out the kingdom of God here in the world we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8807" display="2:26:47" %}} - being used as instruments in the hands of the almighty and so everything we do has meaning and purpose um as contrasted  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8814" display="2:26:54" %}} - to those who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ where for them they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8820" display="2:27:00" %}} - already dead in their sins the things that they do are not contributing to God's kingdom they don't have peace with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8826" display="2:27:06" %}} - God they don't have reconciliation they don't have freedom in the truth I don't know if I need to keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8832" display="2:27:12" %}} - going on and elaborating at least that you can tell me if that's good enough but um it is night and day difference um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8839" display="2:27:19" %}} - and I think It ultimately boils down to what we are talking about is not just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8845" display="2:27:25" %}} - you know breathing air and eating food we are talking about the spiritual aspect of this we are talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8851" display="2:27:31" %}} - truly being alive being connected and one with God through our belief do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8856" display="2:27:36" %}} - do you see it I mean everybody talks about this but that that Matrix movie and the right peel I can't remember if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8862" display="2:27:42" %}} - it's the red peel or the blue peel or whatever you to see things more realistically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8867" display="2:27:47" %}} - you think it's more something like that well uh so even Matrix aside this has been a thing in Philosophy for a long  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8873" display="2:27:53" %}} - time and yes aie I could hear you um when you asked just now um uh there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8879" display="2:27:59" %}} - Plato's allegory the cave talks about this um and the metaphor used there is actually light and darkness um also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8886" display="2:28:06" %}} - commonly comes up in scripture um the the binary contrasts here but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8892" display="2:28:12" %}} - um so is is that what we're getting at yeah I mean you could view it that way for sure um like we are alive because of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8901" display="2:28:21" %}} - the truth we have right um so in Plato's allegory of the cave this corresponds to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8906" display="2:28:26" %}} - not being chained in place looking at a cave wall but actually being out in the world where the there is actually light  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8913" display="2:28:33" %}} - for us as Christians to use that metaphor that is us actually believing spiritual truth having our eyes opened  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8919" display="2:28:39" %}} - and living in it as opposed to being chained in place in Satan's World System  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8924" display="2:28:44" %}} - um and that's getting kind of back to the John 8 verse talking about how the truth sets us free is that we won't live  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8932" display="2:28:52" %}} - fully we will not have complete fullness of life without belief in Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8938" display="2:28:58" %}} - um can you guys hear me now yeah I can hear you so I don't know how much you caught  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8945" display="2:29:05" %}} - of what we were just talking about leis had asked a question uh comparing Spirit like the life we have spiritually with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8952" display="2:29:12" %}} - spiritual death um and so we were talking about that a little bit um okay so spiritual life and spiritual death um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8960" display="2:29:20" %}} - we know that uh that no we lost him again ah how sad  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8969" display="2:29:29" %}} - um you can't hear me well we couldn't for a second um I mean you said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8975" display="2:29:35" %}} - spiritual life and spiritual death and then kind of cut off after that um and we can't hear you now either um I I tell  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8983" display="2:29:43" %}} - you what having connection issues um maybe maybe we'll just keep going here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8990" display="2:29:50" %}} - sort this out Lisa have we have we addressed uh what you were asking more again yeah I do want to give Audi a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8996" display="2:29:56" %}} - chance to talk but it's hard if it keeps cutting out um all right well I tell you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9002" display="2:30:02" %}} - what I'll finish this off here it's unfortunate that we're having connection issues um but hello hello yeah we can we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9010" display="2:30:10" %}} - can hear you but I mean the last times you've you've been talking and then you've just cut out um yeah can't hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9017" display="2:30:17" %}} - you now if you're talking yeah yeah something is wrong I don't know okay um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9022" display="2:30:22" %}} - well we'll finish off here um I think we have been through uh the greater part of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9028" display="2:30:28" %}} - what there is to say on this particular matter um so uh because of our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9034" display="2:30:34" %}} - understanding of the importance of spiritual truth to give meaning to our lives uh to truly let us walk as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9041" display="2:30:41" %}} - ought in Freedom as Christians um again passages I like to support the concept of what we're talking about John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9047" display="2:30:47" %}} - 6 where Jesus talks about him being the bread of life John chapter 4 where we talk about uh the truth of the word of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9054" display="2:30:54" %}} - God being this this spring welling up to Living Water within us right I mean empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9060" display="2:31:00" %}} - of course um these are the things this is what we mean by life when we're talking about life we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9066" display="2:31:06" %}} - spiritual life about being made alive spiritually with God as opposed to spiritually Dead uh through our sin and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9074" display="2:31:14" %}} - not being uh kind of connected to god um so that is the concept of of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9081" display="2:31:21" %}} - have been talking about here with this idea of God is life because God wants that for all of his creatures even those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9088" display="2:31:28" %}} - right now who are not willing to turn to him he has given them that option to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9093" display="2:31:33" %}} - turn to him receive forgiveness for their sins on the basis of the blood of Christ and live these full lives doing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9101" display="2:31:41" %}} - that which he has prepared for them um you know something else uh comes to mind here is uh in Ephesians chapter 2 uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9108" display="2:31:48" %}} - after right after the very famous verses to talk about us being saved by grace through faith we have verse 10 that says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9115" display="2:31:55" %}} - that we've been created in Christ Jesus to do good works uh which God prepared in advance for us to do we have jobs as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9121" display="2:32:01" %}} - Christians again this is getting back to that whole meaning we have a place that we fill in the body of Christ and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9128" display="2:32:08" %}} - gives everything we do spiritual value um that's kind of what we're talking about by being alive and all of this um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9136" display="2:32:16" %}} - from top to bottom is it's all about the truth of God um as contained in the Bible in Jesus The Living Word of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9143" display="2:32:23" %}} - like John chapter 1 talks about um talks about how Jesus is the Divine logos um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9149" display="2:32:29" %}} - the word who became flesh and dwelt Among Us um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9155" display="2:32:35" %}} - so all right well certainly more we could say there but I think that's where we will uh that's where we will close  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9161" display="2:32:41" %}} - out discussion on this section and uh we'll return with the summary of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9166" display="2:32:46" %}} - we've been talking about in this lesson in just a sec  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9172" display="2:32:52" %}} - here all right so that's where we are going to wrap up now uh this discussion that we've been in in this lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9177" display="2:32:57" %}} - talking about God's perfect character so we started out by uh talking about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9183" display="2:33:03" %}} - introduction uh or sorry in the introduction talking about God's idea uh God's moral perfection the idea that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9191" display="2:33:11" %}} - is without flaw he is the greatest that human Minds can possibly comprehend he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9196" display="2:33:16" %}} - has moral perfection um in in a way that we're supposed to emulate as Christians so Matthew 548 says that we're supposed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9203" display="2:33:23" %}} - to be perfect just how our father in Heaven is perfect we talked about uh the Greek word teos there is the adjective  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9209" display="2:33:29" %}} - meaning perfect and it has this sense of completion that maybe doesn't come through as much in that English uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9216" display="2:33:36" %}} - English word here that is the sense of perfect as being full and complete um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9221" display="2:33:41" %}} - and that is what God is in every moral uh sense um he is completely morally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9227" display="2:33:47" %}} - perfect um and in that that naturally leads into uh essential characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9232" display="2:33:52" %}} - of God God is good um the antithesis of evil God is Holy he has to be must be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9239" display="2:33:59" %}} - separate from Evil we talked a little bit about how these things are actually kind of subtly different is that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9244" display="2:34:04" %}} - being good in like an ontological sense is a bit different than him needing to be separate from Evil um you know having  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9251" display="2:34:11" %}} - to condemn evil um we also talked about how God is faithful and true his promises are sure and certain and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9259" display="2:34:19" %}} - we spent a good bit of time uh in the bridge section talking about how all of these things translate into God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9264" display="2:34:24" %}} - sovereignty as de jur ruler of the Universe um the one who on account of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9270" display="2:34:30" %}} - his moral perfection has the authority to judge moral creatures so that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9275" display="2:34:35" %}} - humans and angels in the universe for their actions so we made all these sub  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9280" display="2:34:40" %}} - points here that God possesses The Sovereign authority to demonstrate love to his sinful creatures out of of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9286" display="2:34:46" %}} - own goodness to administer Justice out of his Holiness and to give life out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9291" display="2:34:51" %}} - his truth and faithfulness um and you know we had this a chart that went through all of these things mapped the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9297" display="2:34:57" %}} - essential characteristics of God to their manifestations and creation that process of redemption justification and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9304" display="2:35:04" %}} - Reconciliation that happens uh through the working out of his love Justice and life for us as sinful Humanity um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9313" display="2:35:13" %}} - then we closed by elaborating a bit more uh on on these on these aspects of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9318" display="2:35:18" %}} - character working themselves out in the universe how God is love God is just and God is life and what that means for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9325" display="2:35:25" %}} - as Believers um and as time and again we've emphasized all of this hinges on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9330" display="2:35:30" %}} - centers around the cross of Jesus Christ so we accept God's offer of Life peace  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9336" display="2:35:36" %}} - and Reconciliation that's here this last Slide by accepting receiving the Lord Jesus Christ in just the same way that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9342" display="2:35:42" %}} - we are Justified we receive forgiveness for our sins through accept acting Jesus as our Lord and savior and we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9348" display="2:35:48" %}} - redeemed uh out of God's gracious love for us by accepting him um by believing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9354" display="2:35:54" %}} - in him and so that's where we're going to end this lesson here um so talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9359" display="2:35:59" %}} - here about God's perfect character after we have already come and discussed God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9364" display="2:36:04" %}} - infinite nature and in the next lesson we're going to just be summarizing uh all of the things we've talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9370" display="2:36:10" %}} - here uh in reference to God's Divine Essence um and so that would include his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9376" display="2:36:16" %}} - infinite nature and his perfect character as we've gone over just kind of pulling it all together uh maybe in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9382" display="2:36:22" %}} - more easily digestible summary uh that can be referenced later as kind of shorthand for all of the things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9388" display="2:36:28" %}} - we've gone here that we've gone through here so that's what we will pick up with uh next time

{{< /subjects >}}

God's goodness overflows with love, providing grace for sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says a loving God can't condemn,  
&emsp;He did condemn His Son that we might live,  
&emsp;redeeming us in love with the blood of Christ.

God's holiness overflows in justice, offering mercy to sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says a just God can't forgive,  
&emsp;He did forgive us, by condemning His own Son,  
&emsp;making us righteous through the blood of Christ.

God's faithfulness and truth overflow in life, producing peace with God for sinful Man:  
&emsp;though evil says that a God of integrity can't restore us,  
&emsp;He did make peace between us through His Son,  
&emsp;reconciling us to Himself and granting us eternal life on the basis of the blood of Christ.

{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="40" display="0:40" %}} - words almost coming out poetically here  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="42" display="0:42" %}} - and then we're going to have a picture  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="44" display="0:44" %}} - form this more less a chart that kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="47" display="0:47" %}} - pulls together all of the various  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="48" display="0:48" %}} - characteristics that we've been talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="53" display="0:53" %}} - about so to go over what we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="56" display="0:56" %}} - talking about the last little bit we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="58" display="0:58" %}} - just going to go ahead and review the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="59" display="0:59" %}} - out lines for the lessons that we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="61" display="1:01" %}} - already done in discussion of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="63" display="1:03" %}} - essence of God so the very first thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="66" display="1:06" %}} - that we talked about with the essence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="67" display="1:07" %}} - God was we were just introducing the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="69" display="1:09" %}} - concept we were talking about how the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="72" display="1:12" %}} - essence of God is being he is The Great  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="74" display="1:14" %}} - I Am it is in God's very nature to exist  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="78" display="1:18" %}} - and then we talked about the respondence  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - of God so God is light and that light  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="84" display="1:24" %}} - gets at the sense of his unapproachable  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="86" display="1:26" %}} - ility uh just how you can't stare  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="88" display="1:28" %}} - directly at the Sun and how glory is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="91" display="1:31" %}} - that manifestation of his of his glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="94" display="1:34" %}} - in the world um so sorry the glory is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="96" display="1:36" %}} - the manifestation kind of of that light  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="99" display="1:39" %}} - in the world so God operating through  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="102" display="1:42" %}} - christophanies that came up a bit um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="105" display="1:45" %}} - how we see God's glory manifested in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="107" display="1:47" %}} - world uh very much as uh we can see  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="111" display="1:51" %}} - sunlight um so this these as kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="113" display="1:53" %}} - metaphors to explain the resplendence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="116" display="1:56" %}} - God and then we talked a little bit at  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="118" display="1:58" %}} - the end about how there are are various  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="121" display="2:01" %}} - philosophical positions that people  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="122" display="2:02" %}} - debate in regards to things like Essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="125" display="2:05" %}} - and nature and substance and forms and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="128" display="2:08" %}} - philosophers have these words and how we  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="131" display="2:11" %}} - are going to mostly be limiting  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="132" display="2:12" %}} - ourselves to discussing the essence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="134" display="2:14" %}} - God in terms of what the Bible itself  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="136" display="2:16" %}} - actually says and so we're not going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="138" display="2:18" %}} - necessarily get into the weeds of all  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="139" display="2:19" %}} - that um so this was the introduction of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="143" display="2:23" %}} - some of the things we talked about in uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="145" display="2:25" %}} - this first lesson in this particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="146" display="2:26" %}} - part of the study and then next we moved  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="148" display="2:28" %}} - on to talking about God's infinite  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="150" display="2:30" %}} - nature and so in this we talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="153" display="2:33" %}} - God's abilities uh kind of what he can  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="156" display="2:36" %}} - do and what uh his status as this unique  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="160" display="2:40" %}} - being in the universe is so we started  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="162" display="2:42" %}} - out uh talking about how God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="165" display="2:45" %}} - spiritual God is eternal and God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="167" display="2:47" %}} - immeasurable in a spatial sense and all  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="169" display="2:49" %}} - of these things which are what we would  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="172" display="2:52" %}} - call Essential characteristics of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="174" display="2:54" %}} - independent from creation make God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="176" display="2:56" %}} - unique um and so this was the kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="179" display="2:59" %}} - bridging quality uh that takes us from  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="182" display="3:02" %}} - these initial three to omnipotence  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="185" display="3:05" %}} - omniscience and omnipresence which are  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="187" display="3:07" %}} - how these things end up kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="189" display="3:09" %}} - manifesting in creation itself so  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="192" display="3:12" %}} - because God is spiritual he's omnipotent  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="194" display="3:14" %}} - he can do whatever he pleases in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="196" display="3:16" %}} - material realm because he's Eternal God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="199" display="3:19" %}} - knows everything the end from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="201" display="3:21" %}} - beginning and because he's immeasurable  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="203" display="3:23" %}} - he cannot be bound in a spatial sense he  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="205" display="3:25" %}} - is omnipresent he is everywhere in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="208" display="3:28" %}} - universe so again  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="210" display="3:30" %}} - this uh this particular section uh this  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="213" display="3:33" %}} - lesson in the study going over God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="215" display="3:35" %}} - infinite nature and how that kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="217" display="3:37" %}} - sheds light on his abilities and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="220" display="3:40" %}} - finally we looked at God's perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="222" display="3:42" %}} - character and how that kind of helps  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="224" display="3:44" %}} - illuminate his motives and so for his  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="226" display="3:46" %}} - perfect character we were looking at the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="229" display="3:49" %}} - essential qualities of God that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="231" display="3:51" %}} - good God is Holy and God is faithful and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="233" display="3:53" %}} - true and then our kind of bridge  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="236" display="3:56" %}} - characteristic here was how God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="238" display="3:58" %}} - Sovereign and so this was probably the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="239" display="3:59" %}} - longest section that we went over in  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="242" display="4:02" %}} - these few lessons here talking about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="244" display="4:04" %}} - God is deure a ruler of the Universe on  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="248" display="4:08" %}} - account of being the Creator um so God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="251" display="4:11" %}} - possesses The Sovereign authority to  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="253" display="4:13" %}} - demonstrate love out of his goodness to  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="256" display="4:16" %}} - to administer Justice out of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="257" display="4:17" %}} - Holiness and to give life out of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="260" display="4:20" %}} - truth and faithfulness um and so we had  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="262" display="4:22" %}} - a a handy chart um in this set of slides  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="265" display="4:25" %}} - that kind of like pulled together um how  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="268" display="4:28" %}} - all of this works in terms of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="270" display="4:30" %}} - might call a theological vocabulary of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="273" display="4:33" %}} - redemption um so these these words here  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="276" display="4:36" %}} - Redemption justification and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="278" display="4:38" %}} - Reconciliation kind of describing this  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="280" display="4:40" %}} - process of God's saving sinful man and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="283" display="4:43" %}} - as we emphasize time and again  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="285" display="4:45" %}} - absolutely everything in the plan of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="287" display="4:47" %}} - for saving us hinges upon the cross in  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="289" display="4:49" %}} - the blood of Jesus Christ um so this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="292" display="4:52" %}} - what we were talking about with uh God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="294" display="4:54" %}} - perfect character and then uh we closed  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="297" display="4:57" %}} - off talking about how these aspects  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="299" display="4:59" %}} - manif EST in Creation in how God uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="302" display="5:02" %}} - approaches sinful mankind so God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="305" display="5:05" %}} - goodness is worked out in love God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="307" display="5:07" %}} - holiness is worked out in Justice and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="309" display="5:09" %}} - God's faithfulness and Truth is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="311" display="5:11" %}} - gives us life in this world uh just as  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="314" display="5:14" %}} - we have the metaphor of the water of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="316" display="5:16" %}} - word in John chapter 4 um as well as  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="319" display="5:19" %}} - Jesus saying that uh we must eat his  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="322" display="5:22" %}} - flesh and drink his blood uh in John  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="324" display="5:24" %}} - chapter 6 that's what gives us life um  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="327" display="5:27" %}} - so this is what we have been going over  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="329" display="5:29" %}} - um the last several lessons here and all  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="332" display="5:32" %}} - this is to help us describe God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="335" display="5:35" %}} - essence of who God is what it means for  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="338" display="5:38" %}} - him to be God so this is what we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="340" display="5:40" %}} - been talking about and now we're going  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="342" display="5:42" %}} - to turn to kind of pulling it all  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="344" display="5:44" %}} - together uh maybe in a paragraph or two  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="346" display="5:46" %}} - as well as in a chart to help us  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="348" display="5:48" %}} - summarize everything that we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="349" display="5:49" %}} - talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="353" display="5:53" %}} - about so this is the part of the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="356" display="5:56" %}} - that ichus has that kind of pulls  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="358" display="5:58" %}} - together all of these qualities of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="360" display="6:00" %}} - that we have been talking about um  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="362" display="6:02" %}} - especially this as it relates to kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="364" display="6:04" %}} - redeeming us as sinful man uh from our  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="367" display="6:07" %}} - sins and so as I read this here you'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="370" display="6:10" %}} - notice that uh the paragraphs have kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="372" display="6:12" %}} - of been set as start almost in verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="374" display="6:14" %}} - form and that's because the way that Dr  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="376" display="6:16" %}} - lug M arranged this it sounds very much  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="378" display="6:18" %}} - it has the parallelism uh so to speak of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="381" display="6:21" %}} - poetry I mean it sounds kind of like  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="384" display="6:24" %}} - what you would slip into in some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="385" display="6:25" %}} - Psalms that sort of thing and it really  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="387" display="6:27" %}} - is a very good description of how God  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="390" display="6:30" %}} - has worked out our Redemption um so I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="393" display="6:33" %}} - just going to go ahead and read this um  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="395" display="6:35" %}} - and then we'll go look at after this  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="397" display="6:37" %}} - we'll go look at the chart the picture  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="400" display="6:40" %}} - that kind of represents the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="401" display="6:41" %}} - information but more in a table format  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="403" display="6:43" %}} - but first we're going to go ahead and  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="404" display="6:44" %}} - read uh kind of the verbal  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="406" display="6:46" %}} - representation of God's Redemptive plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="409" display="6:49" %}} - for us so God's goodness overflows with  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="413" display="6:53" %}} - love providing Grace for sinful man  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="416" display="6:56" %}} - though evil says a loving God can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="418" display="6:58" %}} - condemn he did condemn his son that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="420" display="7:00" %}} - might live redeeming Us in love with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="423" display="7:03" %}} - blood of Christ God's holiness overflows  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="426" display="7:06" %}} - Injustice offering Mercy to sinful man  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="429" display="7:09" %}} - though evil says a just God can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="431" display="7:11" %}} - forgive he did forgive us by condemning  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="433" display="7:13" %}} - his own son making us righteous through  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="436" display="7:16" %}} - the blood of Christ God's faithfulness  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="438" display="7:18" %}} - and Truth overflow in life producing  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="441" display="7:21" %}} - peace with God for sinful man though  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="443" display="7:23" %}} - evil says that a god of Integrity can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="445" display="7:25" %}} - restore us he did make peace between us  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="448" display="7:28" %}} - through his son reconciling us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="450" display="7:30" %}} - himself and granting us eternal life on  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="453" display="7:33" %}} - the basis of the blood of Christ and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="455" display="7:35" %}} - you'll notice that just as before when  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="457" display="7:37" %}} - we were going through uh all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="459" display="7:39" %}} - mechanics of this in the character of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="461" display="7:41" %}} - God that absolutely everything here ties  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="464" display="7:44" %}} - back to the blood of Christ um so his  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="467" display="7:47" %}} - goodness overflowing in love Holiness  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="469" display="7:49" %}} - overflows in Justice and faithfulness  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="471" display="7:51" %}} - and Truth overflow in life and all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="473" display="7:53" %}} - this happens um that Redemption the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="475" display="7:55" %}} - justification and the reconciliation all  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="478" display="7:58" %}} - of that happens on the basis of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="480" display="8:00" %}} - blood of Christ just as we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="482" display="8:02" %}} - talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="486" display="8:06" %}} - before all right so now that we've gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="489" display="8:09" %}} - through the text representation of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="6lZG04vtRfY" time="491" display="8:11" %}} - summary here now we're just going to go

### Summary {#introduction-the-trinity-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be starting an examination of a new topic in our study of God: the Trinity. God existing in three persons yet with one shared essence is about as core a concept as any we have in Christianity, which is one of the reasons that heresies related to the Trinity have been among the most existential of all threats to truth in the Church. This being the case, it is very important for us to understand the ins and outs of this keystone doctrine, so that we may stand firm in the truth of the Bible and its teaching.

#### The core definition of the Trinity: God is One in Essence, Three in Person {#introduction-the-trinity-the-core-definition-of-the-trinity-god-is-one-in-essence-three-in-person}

We will examine exactly what this statement means as we continue in our study, but suffice it to say that this idea of "one essence / three persons" (or "three persons / one essence" if you prefer that order to the phrasing instead) is the central point, and what you should always keep in mind when thinking about the Trinity. These two statements together sum up all that is important about the triune nature of God.

<!-- p="Revelation 4:8" -->

In short, no. The Trinity has always been there in the Bible, for those willing to open their eyes and ears to the truth. How later people came to label the idea is in no way related to the fact that this concept has been there in scripture from day one.

{{% ichthys-translation p="Revelation 4:8" %}}
Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord, God, the Almighty  
He who was, and He who is,  
and He who is coming.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

No specific term for the triune nature of God occurs in the Bible. The inspired writers of the New Testament clearly felt that the existence of one God in three distinct persons, the doctrine which we now call "the Trinity", was a relatively straight-forward concept and accessible enough (even with a cursory reading of the scripture) from passages such as the one quoted above.

<!-- --- -->

{{% technical-discussion %}}
To flesh out a bit more why we might make the claim that Revelation 4:8 supports the doctrine of the Trinity, consider:

- The threefold repetition of the adjective Holy (Greek: [ἅγιος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g40/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *hagios*)
- The three titles used: κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ.
  - [κύριος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2962/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *kurios*, means "Lord"
  - [θεός](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *theos*, means "God"
  - [παντοκράτωρ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3841/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *pantokrater*, means "the almighty". It is a compound noun formed from the combination of [πᾶς](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3956/esv/mgnt/0-1/) and [κράτος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2904/esv/mgnt/0-1/).
- The three aspects of God's eternal existence: He who was (ὁ ἦν), and He who is (ὁ ὢν), and He who is to come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος). The first two are, respectively, the imperfect active and present active participles of [εἰμί](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1510/esv/mgnt/0-1/) (Greek's "to be" verb), and the third is a present middle participle, from [ἔρχομαι](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2064/esv/mgnt/0-1/).

Perhaps someone might say that it is not impossible or even particularly uncommon for multiple adjectives and titles to be applied to the same person. Fair enough. But one might also point out this verse's structure of threefold repetition of threes would be somewhat odd unless it were intentional, right? That is, why is it that we have three groups of threes (three Holy's, three titles, and three aspects of God's eternality) rather than some other structure like one/four (two non-three groups), or two/one/three/one (four groups, only one of which is a group of three), and so on?

The explanation that makes the most sense is simply that John, inspired by the Holy Spirit, put things this way intentionally. And therefore it ought not be ignored. QED.

The Apostolic Fathers, the generation that followed the men who actually penned the New Testament, also felt that merely quoting scriptures was an entirely adequate way of discussing the relationship between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Not until the late second and early third centuries did the term "Trinity" itself come into general use as a way of defending (against a variety of heresies which sought to deny various aspects of the unique triune nature of God) what earlier generations of Christians had taken completely for granted based upon their common-sense approach to reading the Bible: that God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all God, and that at the same time they are---in what we may call a "personal" way---also distinct from each other.

God is one. God is also three. And there is no contradiction between these statements.

#### Spelling it out a bit more {#introduction-the-trinity-spelling-it-out-a-bit-more}

As we have said, the core definition of the Trinity is that God is one *in essence*, and three *in person*.

To put the doctrine in complete terms, the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; yet at the same time the Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit, the Son is not the Father or the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son.

{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right so now that we have uh fully discussed the essence of God that's what  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="5" display="0:05" %}} - we've spent the last few lessons talking about we're going to move on to this other section in uh Bible basics part  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="12" display="0:12" %}} - one theology on ichus talking about the uh study of God and now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="18" display="0:18" %}} - move into discussing the Trinity and so this is obviously an important topic for  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="23" display="0:23" %}} - us um in fact it's about as core a concept as any we have in Christianity and that is one of the reasons why it  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="30" display="0:30" %}} - has kind of presented an existential threat to truth in the church um it came under attack early on in Christian  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="36" display="0:36" %}} - history um several different uh flavors of attack you know people who would  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="42" display="0:42" %}} - question the humanity of Christ or the deity of Christ especially in regards to the Trinity saying that Jesus Christ was  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="48" display="0:48" %}} - just a human that he wasn't actually god um and obviously that is a existential  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="54" display="0:54" %}} - threat to our belief as Christians uh we believe that we are saved uh through Jesus Christ who is both full fully man  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="60" display="1:00" %}} - and fully God and died for us on the cross to pay for our sins that is the essence of the gospel and so um attacks  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="67" display="1:07" %}} - on the Trinity very very uh dangerous towards our understanding of the truth  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="72" display="1:12" %}} - and so this being the case it's important for us to kind of understand the ins and outs of this one um it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="78" display="1:18" %}} - something maybe that we should gloss over so much uh because we need to be firm on this so that we can stand firm  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="84" display="1:24" %}} - in the truth of the Bible and its teaching and so here in this lesson uh this is just going to be the introdu  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="89" display="1:29" %}} - trory lesson for talking about the Trinity so we're going to talk about the core definition of the Trinity how God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="96" display="1:36" %}} - is one in essence and three in person that is the the definition uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="102" display="1:42" %}} - simplest and most best way to formulate the doctrine of the Trinity then we're going to talk about uh the terminology  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="108" display="1:48" %}} - here and is the terminology itself important in considering the development of this Doctrine um or is it really not  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="116" display="1:56" %}} - that relevant um so that's a question we'll be considering and then finally we're going to kind of spell it out a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="121" display="2:01" %}} - little bit more kind of make more explicit what this statement here one in essence three in person means in terms  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="127" display="2:07" %}} - of uh all three members of the Trinity are God yet all three members of the Trinity are not each other um and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="134" display="2:14" %}} - you'll see what I mean when we get there U but these are the introductory topics that we're going to be talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="139" display="2:19" %}} - here as we dive into the doctrine of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="145" display="2:25" %}} - Trinity so the core definition of the Trinity as we said is that God is one in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="151" display="2:31" %}} - essence and three in person and so you can't leave off either one of those statements when you formulate the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="157" display="2:37" %}} - Trinity otherwise you run into heresy and so we're going to be examining exactly what the statement means as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="163" display="2:43" %}} - continue in the study but suffice it to say that this idea of one Essence and three persons or three persons and one  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="169" display="2:49" %}} - Essence if you prefer to order it that way this is the central point and what you should always keep in mind when  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="174" display="2:54" %}} - thinking about the Trinity these two statements together sum up all that is important about the Triune nature of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="182" display="3:02" %}} - and so uh in talking about this in how we formulate it this is where we always  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="187" display="3:07" %}} - want to start when we talk about the Trinity and I will say that obviously we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="192" display="3:12" %}} - could jump off from here and get into all sorts of discussions but just because we're introducing things um you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="199" display="3:19" %}} - know any questions that come up um kind of my thought for what we talk about here is uh just maybe people have a hard  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="206" display="3:26" %}} - time understanding like what this means and if we get too off in the weeds I'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="211" display="3:31" %}} - kind of pull us back and and just be like you know we have plenty more lessons in the study of the Trinity to cover what it means and so we don't want  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="218" display="3:38" %}} - to load everything up front here but Audi do you have initial thoughts on just this presentation of how we talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="224" display="3:44" %}} - about it uh this simple definition uh that ichus presents as the starting point for discussing the doctrine I  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="231" display="3:51" %}} - think that um the reason that uh that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="237" display="3:57" %}} - statement is used is that it's really very hard to describe what the Trinity is it's it's really hard even when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="245" display="4:05" %}} - have a certain degree of understanding of it discussing it is very tough um  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="252" display="4:12" %}} - because we're talking about one God and we're talking about three persons in in in our experience of uh of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="260" display="4:20" %}} - life as human beings it's very hard to to to conceive of something of that sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="267" display="4:27" %}} - it's not in our experience at all so so that use of one Essence and three person  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="273" display="4:33" %}} - is is a sort of Genius it's a way of saying we're still talking about one  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="279" display="4:39" %}} - thing even when we're talking about three persons um but if you don't use  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="286" display="4:46" %}} - that terminology in my experience when you try to explain it in any other way you keep running into all sorts of difficulties you end up trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="294" display="4:54" %}} - explain that you're not talking about three gods or you try to explain that you're not talking about one person you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="299" display="4:59" %}} - know um I've tried to make the analogy for example that there are if you were  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="305" display="5:05" %}} - to compare it to being human beings You' say that um well not just human beings but dogs anything that has a particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="313" display="5:13" %}} - nature you'd say well all three persons have this same nature but the trouble  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="320" display="5:20" %}} - with saying that is well they each have their own copy of that nature so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="326" display="5:26" %}} - speak just like um I'm human Ste is human Lisa is human Abby is human these  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="333" display="5:33" %}} - are all human beings right and we share  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="339" display="5:39" %}} - Humanity it's something we have in common but I have my Humanity Stephen  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="344" display="5:44" %}} - has his humanity and Abby has high humanity and Lisa has her humanity and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="350" display="5:50" %}} - JD has his humanity and so on and so forth so when you when you look at it that way  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="357" display="5:57" %}} - you see it doesn't quite describe describe the Trinity because when it comes to the Trinity they all have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="363" display="6:03" %}} - same Essence they don't have similar Essence in that what the father has is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="368" display="6:08" %}} - similar to what the son has which is similar to what the spirit has it's that they all have the same thing they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="375" display="6:15" %}} - one thing that they share in common so in the end it just makes it's easiest  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="382" display="6:22" %}} - and and um probably most accurate to say that they have one essence even though  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="389" display="6:29" %}} - they're three person so that's uh I I I think it's it's really the the only way  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="396" display="6:36" %}} - to describe it without ending up in some really tough places sure and I think the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="401" display="6:41" %}} - way that ikas phrases it um I I actually kind of reward it a little bit just because of how I structure the slides  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="406" display="6:46" %}} - but AAS calls it the simplest and best way to describe it um and I think that's really getting to the heart of this of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="413" display="6:53" %}} - if you start here then it's a matter of clarifying what exactly we mean by this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="418" display="6:58" %}} - right um that's that's a good place to start right not so much that that people are off in the weeds because if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="425" display="7:05" %}} - start to try to explain it by analogy perhaps not that ichus does present several analogies as we'll see so for  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="431" display="7:11" %}} - example visible light the light spectrum right it's all light yet it's of different wavelengths for example um if  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="438" display="7:18" %}} - you start with the analogies it just it's harder to be there because then you have to explain  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="444" display="7:24" %}} - all these things how it's not really quite the same it's just an analogy and so on and so forth and so agree um in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="450" display="7:30" %}} - terms of how we formulate this the reason why we start here um even though usually it will require some explanation  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="456" display="7:36" %}} - because for example what does Essence mean exactly U we'll get into that as we as we continue going on Lesson by lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="463" display="7:43" %}} - in our study of the Trinity here but the reason why we start with this formulation um and and we'll get a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="468" display="7:48" %}} - little bit more to the end about another way to restate this right that uh sort of more full accounting of what this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="475" display="7:55" %}} - statement translates to in terms of logic but why we start here is just because it's the best way for us to dive  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="480" display="8:00" %}} - into this topic which as AI said is just kind of hard to explain um it's just kind of a fact that we have to deal with  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="487" display="8:07" %}} - here that it's hard for us as humans to wrap our heads around this uh one particular thing maybe you might have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="493" display="8:13" %}} - more thoughts on this too is just understanding the unity that's involved in this is not something that humans  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="500" display="8:20" %}} - have a direct analog to in our experience and so um we we we can  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="505" display="8:25" %}} - understand you know being united like as a team perhaps is humans or you know we're in agreement as a group but it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="512" display="8:32" %}} - not the unity that you know the the members of the Trinity have it's of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="518" display="8:38" %}} - completely different nature than that and that's why the one Essence bit is important here because uh if you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="524" display="8:44" %}} - somehow convey that uh the unity uh you know the the sharedness if you will that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="532" display="8:52" %}} - the Trinity members possess then you end up with basically hand waving your way of well we have three people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="539" display="8:59" %}} - really somehow one person and then you become unconvincing um and so uh Unity is a big big part of what we need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="546" display="9:06" %}} - focus on when we explain what the Trinity is and how uh the three members of the godhead function together is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="553" display="9:13" %}} - they have a Unity completely unlike anything that we can conceptualize as humans at least Unity between human  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="559" display="9:19" %}} - beings simply because they are all God um so I I don't know if you want to rip  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="566" display="9:26" %}} - on any of that as I say we'll get into all of this much more as we explain uh in the coming lessons exactly what the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="572" display="9:32" %}} - Trinity is and what it is not um but anything more to say or shall we move on to the next Point yeah we can move on  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="580" display="9:40" %}} - yeah okay great so now kind of having covered this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="587" display="9:47" %}} - initial definition of the Trinity that is that God is one in essence but three in person we're going to be talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="594" display="9:54" %}} - about the terminology here and kind of asking the question if the terminology itself is important when we uh consider  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="601" display="10:01" %}} - the development of this Doctrine and what we mean by that is sort of how people talk about it um if it was  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="606" display="10:06" %}} - formalized to kind of help argue against various heresies in the early church well what does that mean in regards to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="613" display="10:13" %}} - uh whether the doctrine existed in scripture before that you know it didn't just come to exist when we made a label  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="620" display="10:20" %}} - for it right um it existed before that and that's going to kind of be what we emphasize here and so in answering this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="627" display="10:27" %}} - question uh is the terminy itself important in considering the development of the doctrine uh the general answer to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="633" display="10:33" %}} - that question is no uh because the Trinity has always been there in the Bible for those who are willing to open  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="638" display="10:38" %}} - their eyes and ears to the truth um the Bible writes of this you might think um on the road to emus uh you know when  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="646" display="10:46" %}} - Jesus explains uh to those he was walking with you know how the Old Testament spoke of him um a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="651" display="10:51" %}} - fascinating conversation that we kind of wish we had right what passages exactly did Jesus use uh to talk about about  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="659" display="10:59" %}} - himself right as displayed in the Old Testament you know we we might think maybe Isaiah 53 the suffering servant  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="665" display="11:05" %}} - that's a possibility um other plenty of there's plenty of other references in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="670" display="11:10" %}} - the Old Testament uh that are christological in nature that's the jargony way to say they point to Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="676" display="11:16" %}} - Christ um and specifically Jesus Christ as God um but in any case how later  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="682" display="11:22" %}} - people came to label the idea of the Trinity kind of isn't really related to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="688" display="11:28" %}} - the fact that the concept of the Trinity has been there in scripture from day one in fact not just in the New Testament  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="694" display="11:34" %}} - it's been there even in the Old Testament from day one and so that's kind of the important point for us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="699" display="11:39" %}} - recognize here is that the Trinity is it's an aspect of God's existence right we talked about how God is existence God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="705" display="11:45" %}} - exists external to SpaceTime uh so he exists Before Time so to speak and God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="710" display="11:50" %}} - has always been Triune in nature so the Trinity is inherent to God it is in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="715" display="11:55" %}} - in no way conditional upon creation and in understanding that the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="721" display="12:01" %}} - people kind of developed terminology to talk about it more doesn't mean that no one believed in the Trinity before they  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="727" display="12:07" %}} - started using these words um and you might kind of laugh and say well why are we even bothering to say that that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="732" display="12:12" %}} - kind of common sense right but you know there is this idea and I I couldn't tell you why it seems like nonsense to me but  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="739" display="12:19" %}} - it it's there in um biblical studies Academia a bit um people talk about the development of doctrine that may be how  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="746" display="12:26" %}} - they phrase it but the development of the Trinity like it just seems to me  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="752" display="12:32" %}} - very silly and ich this is very clear um you'll see in the formulation so this paragraph up here this was me but this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="757" display="12:37" %}} - is uh ichus specifically I'll actually read this now it says uh that no specific term for the Triune nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="764" display="12:44" %}} - God exists in the Bible and this is where Dr Lugo kind of throws down his Gauntlet and says you know this is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="770" display="12:50" %}} - we need to believe regardless of what other people say he says the inspired writers of the New Testament clearly  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="775" display="12:55" %}} - felt that the existence of one God in three distinct persons the doctrine which we now call the Trinity was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="781" display="13:01" %}} - relatively straightforward concept and accessible enough even with a cursory reading of the scripture from passages  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="787" display="13:07" %}} - such as the one quoted above and then he quotes Revelation 4:8 which we'll get to in a second but the point is is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="794" display="13:14" %}} - it's there in the Bible you know and so the fact that some people started talking about it in a certain way in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="799" display="13:19" %}} - late second and early 3 Century doesn't mean that no one before that actually believed in the Trinity it's complete  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="805" display="13:25" %}} - nonsense um but for whatever reason we actually have to make this because some people apparently think that uh quote  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="812" display="13:32" %}} - unquote Doctrine was developed and I guess that people before that didn't properly understand the Trinity or something like that which I just think  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - is complete nonsense um so that's why we're spending the time here to kind of go over this point and so Dr lugan Bill  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="825" display="13:45" %}} - uses uh this verse here in Revelation chapter 4:8 so I'll go ahead and read it and then on the next slide we're going  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="831" display="13:51" %}} - to kind of go over well if we say this as a kind of evidence be it direct or  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="836" display="13:56" %}} - indirect for the Trinity well kind of how does that work right I had this question when I first saw the verse and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="841" display="14:01" %}} - that Dr luging was using it as okay so if we're using this verse um as one of those passages in the Bible uh that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="848" display="14:08" %}} - makes the Trinity a straightforward and accessible concept as we've been just arguing well how does it do that so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="854" display="14:14" %}} - verse here uh Revelation chapter 4:8 says this holy holy holy the Lord God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="862" display="14:22" %}} - the almighty he who was and he who is and he who is coming so we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="867" display="14:27" %}} - split this down break it down to kind of go into a bit more detail how this verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="872" display="14:32" %}} - which maybe doesn't look on the face of it to have all that much relationship to the Trinity how does this support uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="879" display="14:39" %}} - kind of a trinitarian understanding of God and so to flush all this out a bit more um I don't want to get too bogged  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="885" display="14:45" %}} - down in the Greek here but you know I just I included the Greek words uh just for people who know it who might be  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="890" display="14:50" %}} - interested um the kind of the the core reason why we say this verse supports  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="896" display="14:56" %}} - the Trinity and gives us that kind kind of the feeling of the trium nature of God is that in this verse we have we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="903" display="15:03" %}} - have three sets of Threes right so you know the Trinity obviously composed of three people but we have a three-fold  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - repetition first off of the adjective holy in Greek so in Greek that's the word hagios um we have a three-fold  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="917" display="15:17" %}} - repetition of the adjective holy so rather than just holy we have holy holy holy the Lord God the almighty now of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="924" display="15:24" %}} - course repetition uh is used across languages for emphasis but we have three  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - holies here uh next we have three titles used um so cuos Theos and Ponto right  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="938" display="15:38" %}} - those are the Greek words cuos is the normal word for Lord Theos of course means God and this is the more  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="944" display="15:44" %}} - interesting one Ponto is literally translates as the Almighty we kind of have an English word that translate this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="951" display="15:51" %}} - um but this is made from the Greek word for all and the Greek word for power so the all powerful one the almighty um  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="959" display="15:59" %}} - three titles right so we said uh three repetitions of the adjective holy three titles here and then after that we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="966" display="16:06" %}} - the three aspects of God's Eternal existence right he who was this is the imperfect participle he who is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="973" display="16:13" %}} - present participle and then he who is to come this one's a middle participle so  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="978" display="16:18" %}} - most people probably won't be that interested in this but the point is you know God existed in the past he exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="983" display="16:23" %}} - now and he is to exist in the future past present and future three aspects of Eternal existence so you'll notice here  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="991" display="16:31" %}} - we have three sets of thre and so someone kind of might say well it's not impossible or even particularly uncommon  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="998" display="16:38" %}} - for multiple adjectives and titles to be applied to the same person right so you might think of kings and Emperors  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1003" display="16:43" %}} - throughout history were given epithets or if you're familiar with uh like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1009" display="16:49" %}} - Greek epics for example like Homer various heroes in The Iliad were given  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1014" display="16:54" %}} - epithets you know that it's a title um so different people can have multiple titles multiple adjectives appli to them and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1020" display="17:00" %}} - that doesn't like break grammatical rules or anything so that's fair enough point but you might also point out here  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1026" display="17:06" %}} - that this versus structure of three-fold repetition of Threes would be somewhat  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1031" display="17:11" %}} - odd unless it were intentional so why would we have three sets of Threes in this verse rather than for example uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1039" display="17:19" %}} - you know two sets of things that weren't threes so right what what what if we had like one adjective and four titles or  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1047" display="17:27" %}} - what if we had two adjectives one title the three aspects of God's existence and then one other thing right so having  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - something that's like 2131 rather than 3 three three so four groups only one of which is a group of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - three and so on you know you can come up with other examples here but the very fact that we have three sets of Threes  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1066" display="17:46" %}} - in this verse it just means that the explanation that makes the most sense is simply that John inspired by the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1072" display="17:52" %}} - Spirit put things this way intentionally and therefore we ought not to ignore it uh QED that's how the general argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1079" display="17:59" %}} - here goes is that why would this verse be structured uh in this very specific way with three sets of Threes all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1086" display="18:06" %}} - which Echo the three-fold nature of God if we're not supposed to read something into it um so uh hopefully that's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1093" display="18:13" %}} - little bit helpful in understanding why this verse here in Revelation chap 4:8 kind of helps point us to the idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1099" display="18:19" %}} - the Trinity Now by no means is this the verse on which the doctrine of the Trinity Rises and Falls this is just an  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1105" display="18:25" %}} - example of where we get it in scripture there are plenty of other verses uh that are relevant in this discussion many of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1112" display="18:32" %}} - which we will get to as we continue studying this topic but I just to give you an example of Trinity in the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1118" display="18:38" %}} - well this is one place where we can look as a passage that references it so kind of to turn our attention here back to uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1126" display="18:46" %}} - you know the usage of terminology in the early church and what we should make of that uh so the apostolic fathers which  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1132" display="18:52" %}} - is the generation that followed the men who actually Penn the New Testament so the apostles the apostolic fathers  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1138" display="18:58" %}} - that's what they're called um also felt that merely quoting scriptures was an entirely adequate way of discussing the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1144" display="19:04" %}} - relationship between the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and so to translate translate that into more plain  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1149" display="19:09" %}} - English they didn't get very doctrinal and start building up all these systems and and argumentation about all this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1156" display="19:16" %}} - because they were just like yeah the Bible you know the Bible talks about the father and the Bible talks about the Son and the Bible talks about the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1162" display="19:22" %}} - Spirit and they just kind of shrugged and they didn't make a big deal out of it and so it's not until the late second and early thirr centuries that the term  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1168" display="19:28" %}} - Trinity came into General use as a way of Defending against a variety of heresies which sought to deny various  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1174" display="19:34" %}} - aspects of what we now call the Trinity uh again one of the most prominent ones being that Jesus Christ wasn't actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1181" display="19:41" %}} - god um well they kind of developed this as a way to talk about these things to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1186" display="19:46" %}} - defend against people who were saying that things were not so um so they they  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1191" display="19:51" %}} - came into all of this uh for what early Generations had taken completely for granted based upon their common approach  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1198" display="19:58" %}} - to reading the Bible well now they kind of developed a system to talk about these things but as I emphasized from  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1204" display="20:04" %}} - the beginning here that doesn't mean that people before this point didn't believe in the Trinity or didn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1210" display="20:10" %}} - understand the Trinity this just came about in a specific time and place in human history as a result largely uh to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1216" display="20:16" %}} - help argue against various heresies that were challenging aspects of the Trinity and so that is uh what we are talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1223" display="20:23" %}} - about here this system came into place to make clear the fact that God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1229" display="20:29" %}} - Father the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are all actually God while at the same time uh in what we might  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1234" display="20:34" %}} - call a personal way they're all distinct from each other right that is the Trinity um and the challenge of this and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1240" display="20:40" %}} - also of course why there have been so many challenges to this is because in saying this we are saying that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1246" display="20:46" %}} - one and yet God is also three and that there's no contradiction between these statements but people always want to see  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1251" display="20:51" %}} - a contradiction there and that's why the heresies arose and that's why people started kind of um that's right way to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1258" display="20:58" %}} - put this uh making a system in order to debate these matters to defend the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1264" display="21:04" %}} - doctrine against challenges to it and it got a little bit more formalized but that doesn't mean that even before that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1269" display="21:09" %}} - point that people weren't talking about it or believing in it and things like that so that was introduction here to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1277" display="21:17" %}} - this idea of terminology as it relates to the development of the doctrine of the Trinity so Audie do you have initial  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1283" display="21:23" %}} - thoughts about what we've been talking about here in this section um yeah I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1288" display="21:28" %}} - think just to strengthen what you already said that um Trinity is a is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1294" display="21:34" %}} - word that was invented to capture what was actually in the Bible matter of fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1300" display="21:40" %}} - is um it it it seems as if the Bible is less interested in telling you about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1309" display="21:49" %}} - Trinity and More in just telling you you know about the persons that it's talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1315" display="21:55" %}} - about so it just starts talking about Jesus Christ Christ and just out of the blue starts talking about him as God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1322" display="22:02" %}} - same thing with the father same thing with the Holy Spirit it doesn't seem to um be particularly concerned about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1329" display="22:09" %}} - fact that someone reading that might go wait wait what's happening the Bible just takes for  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1335" display="22:15" %}} - granted that well Jesus is God the father is God the holy spirit is God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1342" display="22:22" %}} - there is one God get with the program you know so but people started to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - an issue of that and that's why just like you said they the word was eventually invented just to make sure  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1355" display="22:35" %}} - that we could talk about these things and make clear what we are saying um we could also conceive of it as a try Unity  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1363" display="22:43" %}} - that's a the perfect Unity of three persons that the unity so perfect and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1371" display="22:51" %}} - complete that it means that they are one God they're not three Gods they're in perfect unity in everything that really  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1377" display="22:57" %}} - counts but they are three three separate individuals so um uh the the term itself  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1383" display="23:03" %}} - the word itself is a word of convenience the Bible presents the whole thing as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1390" display="23:10" %}} - matter of fact and does not really go into how and why and all of that just  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1397" display="23:17" %}} - tells you well um like uh in Zechariah I  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1403" display="23:23" %}} - believe chapter 12 where it said um uh they will look upon me whom they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1409" display="23:29" %}} - pierced and you know the Lord God said to me the Lord God has sent me and so on  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1417" display="23:37" %}} - and so forth you know it's like it just says it like it's the most natural thing in the world why does it confuse you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1425" display="23:45" %}} - know so but the term itself is just for convenience yeah yeah I mean and I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1431" display="23:51" %}} - to bounce off what you said a bit this is the problem that people have when they kind of approach the Bible with a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1437" display="23:57" %}} - precon notion of what it ought to say right so if you are and your faith is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1442" display="24:02" %}} - being attacked by this very convinced guy over here who says you're wrong and you wish you could just find ammunition  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1449" display="24:09" %}} - that directly proved him wrong in the Bible you might throw up your hands and say well why didn't the Bible you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1454" display="24:14" %}} - phrase you know very systematic uh you know basically a systematic study of the nature of God in the Trinity so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1461" display="24:21" %}} - like with Point 1 B2 I might prove my interlocutor wrong well that's just not  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1468" display="24:28" %}} - the purpose of the Bible right and I mean we don't want to get too hand waving talking about quote unquote the purpose of the Bible right but  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1474" display="24:34" %}} - essentially God gives us everything we need to know but there's a reason why he doesn't give us more you know and some  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1480" display="24:40" %}} - of that as the gospels make clear is that uh we are supposed to as Christians exercise our free will to want to dig if  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1487" display="24:47" %}} - we do not dig to understand if we do not try we do not search we do not find  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1492" display="24:52" %}} - teachers who can help explain things to us we will not grow part of this whole process of the reason why we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1498" display="24:58" %}} - imperfect information so to speak is because it gives us the opportunity to choose um and so uh in this particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1506" display="25:06" %}} - instance we would say that the Bible it's not that the Bible doesn't support the Trinity it's that people who want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1514" display="25:14" %}} - deny Christianity on account of the Trinity specifically are given enough room to do so right um and anyone who  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1522" display="25:22" %}} - cares enough to actually read the Bible with an open mind and think and ask questions will come to the understanding  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1528" display="25:28" %}} - that the Trinity is true and that the Bible teaches it and that it's not like the Bible is vague or nebulous about it  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1534" display="25:34" %}} - and you know we'll go over some of the passages that maybe we're just waving our hand now but we will be more convincing about this I promise but the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1540" display="25:40" %}} - whole point is is that the Bible is not systematic in its its outlining of these things right maybe perhaps not how an  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1547" display="25:47" %}} - apologist would desire to May to go use his ammunition against people arguing against his position right and so we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1553" display="25:53" %}} - need to not read in our preconceived notions of what the Bible ought to say you know another example that comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1558" display="25:58" %}} - directly to mind here is people want the Bible to talk about uh you know the creation of the universe as if it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1564" display="26:04" %}} - science textbook right um and For Better or Worse a common argument trotted out  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1570" display="26:10" %}} - in defense of that was that the Bible is you know it's not a science textbook which is true but we don't need to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1577" display="26:17" %}} - like ashamed or feel dirty when we say that because the Bible is everything that God saw fit to give to us and if he  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1583" display="26:23" %}} - thought we needed more information he would have given it to us so uh you know just basically like AI said and and like  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1590" display="26:30" %}} - the early people said we can just shrug and be like well the Bible says this and the Bible says this and the Bible says this and and you know basically why are  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1597" display="26:37" %}} - you getting so upset about uh you know you set up this system of Doctrine and you're like well I see points a and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1603" display="26:43" %}} - points B and point C this doesn't mean that we can't be systematic and rigorous when we study things but we just need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1608" display="26:48" %}} - understand what the purpose of the text that has been given us is right we need to study it in the in the manner and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1615" display="26:55" %}} - way in which God intends for us to use it um am I being too vague AI do you want to bounce off anything I'm saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1621" display="27:01" %}} - or you think the point is sufficient into itself I I think it is I think it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1629" display="27:09" %}} - okay great well I don't have too much more to say here um I do think this is an important point it's why Dr lugan  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1635" display="27:15" %}} - bille I mean I made me chuckle a bit when I was reading it you know the strongness that he comes you know about the here let me some specific words here  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1643" display="27:23" %}} - right the straightforward and accessible nature of this Doctrine right because  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - the reason why this makes me chuckle is because I can think of people specifically atheists or agnostics who  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1654" display="27:34" %}} - would think that these statements are not true right that the Bible is not clear on this matter or at least it  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1660" display="27:40" %}} - could be a whole lot more clear and therefore uh they find fault with God on account of this but this is one of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1667" display="27:47" %}} - things where people who look with eyes of Faith it's there you know um uh in in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1673" display="27:53" %}} - the same way that all of these other beliefs that we carry as Christians maybe even beliefs that kind of cut against the common grain well God gives  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1681" display="28:01" %}} - us minds and he empowers us with his holy spirit to interpret his truth and if we believe we will see the things  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1688" display="28:08" %}} - that are behind uh the material things in this world right we'll see the spiritual realities behind them um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1696" display="28:16" %}} - so in our particular example here all we're saying is that the Trinity is in the Bible and that is sufficient unto  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1702" display="28:22" %}} - itself um if people don't like that if they if they say that we're just a that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1708" display="28:28" %}} - and that uh I don't know that we need to somehow prove it it's kind of their problem um and and you know there it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1714" display="28:34" %}} - not to say that people who are gifted in apologetics cannot engage on this matter or that nothing more could be said or  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1720" display="28:40" %}} - that we can't even defend it from critics right because obviously our forbears uh you know one of the points we made was that they they came up with  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1726" display="28:46" %}} - this terminology uh and ways of outlining and expressing the doctrine and our belief and and I mean not that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1733" display="28:53" %}} - they were perfect or anything but this isn't something that we need to censure them for for right we're defending the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1738" display="28:58" %}} - truth we're standing up for the truth that's a good thing however between us as Christians when we're when we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1744" display="29:04" %}} - trying to explain this to other believers the point is is that the Bible talks about it it's sufficient if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1750" display="29:10" %}} - look for it and with eyes of Faith understanding that this is something that we need to believe about God it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1757" display="29:17" %}} - there you know you don't have to go into mental gymnastic to do it but if you try to convince someone who's skeptical who  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1763" display="29:23" %}} - is set not to believe you're probably never going to convince them no matter what verses you show right  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1769" display="29:29" %}} - um all right so anything more to say on this topic before we move on to the next  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1775" display="29:35" %}} - you're quite right I I don't think that um there is uh much in the way of like I  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1782" display="29:42" %}} - I said before I I I think that it's very deliberate on the part of the Bible that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1787" display="29:47" %}} - it just presents a lot of these things as statements of fact it's more like  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1793" display="29:53" %}} - um why are you confused it's this it's that it's that end of story you know just take it take  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1800" display="30:00" %}} - it as it is so if anyone needs to be persuaded that the Trinity is a thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1806" display="30:06" %}} - that it is what the Bible teaches well let's let's just say you will never succeed at actually convincing them of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1813" display="30:13" %}} - it it's one of those things the Bible says that we will know when we um uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1820" display="30:20" %}} - when when we put off this body when we are we eventually come to be with the Lord because at that time we will have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1828" display="30:28" %}} - faculties that are better able to make sense of um spiritual realities of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1835" display="30:35" %}} - sort but it's sufficient to say he is God he is not a man he is not a creature  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1842" display="30:42" %}} - he's not like the universe he made so we should not expect him to be like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1848" display="30:48" %}} - universe that we made we already talked about um the matter of his existence the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1854" display="30:54" %}} - fact that the way that God exists is different than the way way that the Universe exists we have no concept of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1860" display="31:00" %}} - how something could possibly self- exist it's not in our experience things don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1865" display="31:05" %}} - just exist we we Trace things to their beginning and then we say before they  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1873" display="31:13" %}} - came to exist something happened to bring them to exist we can't make sense of God like that likewise we cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1880" display="31:20" %}} - really make sense of how he is in the composition of his presence so to speak  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1888" display="31:28" %}} - we know that Jesus is God the holy spirit is God the father is God how do  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1894" display="31:34" %}} - we know Bible says it we also know that the father is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1900" display="31:40" %}} - Jesus that Jesus is not the Holy Spirit and that there is only one God we know that because the Bible says that we call  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1907" display="31:47" %}} - it the Trinity because it's a big thing to it's a mouthful if you want to you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1914" display="31:54" %}} - describe the whole thing what we just said now is something you would want to capture in um a few syllables to be able  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1923" display="32:03" %}} - to use it when you have to speak of it and that's why Trinity as a word exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1928" display="32:08" %}} - so if people are not persuaded by that and I've had so many debates so many debates with atheists with agnostics  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1936" display="32:16" %}} - with even fellow Believers about this that I've just realized it's it's really pointless to debate it because the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1941" display="32:21" %}} - statements are just obvious right on the bare face of it I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1947" display="32:27" %}} - I think one of the ones that I just pointed out is that one was pretty mind-blowing when I when I eventually  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1952" display="32:32" %}} - saw it where um Zariah was saying that the Lord God said to him that the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1958" display="32:38" %}} - God had sent him and you know so it was a pretty interesting thing to say and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1965" display="32:45" %}} - there are people I think the the biggest experience of this that I had in my life  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1971" display="32:51" %}} - was with um the Jehovah's Witnesses who are adamant about the fact that Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1977" display="32:57" %}} - not God and they hate the very concept of the Trinity they believe that it's a idea that was imported into Christianity  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1985" display="33:05" %}} - so um when when you talk with such people you come to realize it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1991" display="33:11" %}} - trying to convince an atheist that God exists my experience of such a thing is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="1996" display="33:16" %}} - that it's too obvious to argue and when this is one of the the things I have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2003" display="33:23" %}} - problems with the oldtimers for I mean the so-called Church fathers and church  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2010" display="33:30" %}} - doctors and whatnot I have this issue with them that because they were trying to make sense of the obvious they ended  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2018" display="33:38" %}} - up inventing philosophies that were actually alien to the Bible just to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2024" display="33:44" %}} - sense of something the Bible says it is sufficient that the Bible said it if the person is not willing to accept the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2031" display="33:51" %}} - testimony of the Bible well what more can we say we have nothing more to say at that point there are doctrines in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2037" display="33:57" %}} - Bible that require some work and that where you can say this is how and this is why but in the scriptures we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2044" display="34:04" %}} - have the how and the why um uh the father is not Jesus and Jesus is not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2050" display="34:10" %}} - Holy Spirit and and the three are individually God and yet there is one  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2056" display="34:16" %}} - God we we don't know how that is we don't really know why that is but we we do know that it is because the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2064" display="34:24" %}} - says that it is and I think that's what we should be very satisfied within every conversation we have with people yep I  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2071" display="34:31" %}} - mean I will say specifically if people are unfamiliar with kind of the debates that Audi reference shorthand there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2077" display="34:37" %}} - this concept of Eternal beginning you may have heard this it's even in the Nan Creed right it gets formalized people  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2084" display="34:44" %}} - say this I don't think many people think about it but there's also this idea that the spirit proceeds from the father and  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2089" display="34:49" %}} - the son um you'll hear this this come up from the mouths especially of perhaps  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2094" display="34:54" %}} - Catholic folks or Orthodox folks where they try to explain the Trinity a lot more than what's really there in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2100" display="35:00" %}} - text right um that's some of what we're getting at here um and these systems of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2105" display="35:05" %}} - philosophy where you're you're trying to you're trying to explain something that human beings can't explain right this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2112" display="35:12" %}} - a very very important concept I don't want us to get super off topic but very important concept for us as Christians  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2118" display="35:18" %}} - is basically learning when we need to like stop pushing on something and demanding an explanation from God right  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2125" display="35:25" %}} - um this is one of those areas in fact I will say that many of the areas that we need to be kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2155" display="35:55" %}} - gunshy31 but then we will see clearly Right This Side of Heaven we have no  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2160" display="36:00" %}} - chance of understanding certain things now that doesn't mean we should throw up our hands in cases where we really can  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2167" display="36:07" %}} - explain but we just need to be humble enough to say well the Bible said it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2172" display="36:12" %}} - this case and I'm gonna stick with that even if the system you've invented you know it's it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2179" display="36:19" %}} - self-rationalizing  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2186" display="36:26" %}} - I think that's where we'll cut this section and and the next we will pick up just kind of fleshing out a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2193" display="36:33" %}} - more what that statement means and then that's where we will close out uh this week here our introduction of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2199" display="36:39" %}} - concept of the Trinity so right before we move on to the next bit we actually paused had a couple good good points  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2205" display="36:45" %}} - brought up uh uh good things discussed so uh one thing to start with initially  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2210" display="36:50" %}} - is just that um even in the Bible the time that uh the apostles Paul and John  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2217" display="36:57" %}} - were writing parts of the New Testament we actually already had some of these challenges cropping up so you got to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2222" display="37:02" %}} - careful exactly which corners of scholarship you lean into and so on but uh the Apostle John was writing about  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2230" display="37:10" %}} - the Incarnation of Christ and emphasizing how Jesus Christ was actually a human being and it might seem  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2235" display="37:15" %}} - kind of weird to us especially when we're talking about the Trinity but this is combating an early form of what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2240" display="37:20" %}} - typically called gnosticism this idea that Jesus was just somehow spiritual or something like that um and of course  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2247" display="37:27" %}} - Paul is uh he does reason with people various places in his Epistles but he too is arguing against incipient  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2253" display="37:33" %}} - challenges to a proper understanding of God and the thing to keep in mind in all  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2258" display="37:38" %}} - this so for example when Paul upgrades the Corinthians and uh First Corinthians and so on is that he really got down on  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2265" display="37:45" %}} - them for kind of their over intellectualization uh you know I say that that's a really big word in my intellectual on their over  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2272" display="37:52" %}} - intellectualization of certain aspects of of uh the beliefs that we have as Christians and so um you know if they  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2279" display="37:59" %}} - try to make things conform to platonism neoplatonism Aristotelian logic you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2284" display="38:04" %}} - are are they getting wrapped up in all of this uh intellectual sounding mumbo jumbo rather than understanding what has  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2292" display="38:12" %}} - been passed down to us in the Bible um and so already at that point we kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2297" display="38:17" %}} - run into this idea that um it's not that you know our understanding of the Trinity for example is illogical is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2304" display="38:24" %}} - simply that we can only go up to a certain point and because of that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2309" display="38:29" %}} - just need to acknowledge our own limits as human beings and these limits another Point brought up during discussion these  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2314" display="38:34" %}} - limits apply to all human beings it's not like uh it is allowable for certain  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2320" display="38:40" %}} - people who might consider themselves wise teachers or whatever to be like ah well you don't really understand the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2325" display="38:45" %}} - Trinity just because you're not wise enough unwashed masses of Believers that's not how it works um all of us as  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2333" display="38:53" %}} - human beings are limited in our perspective uh simply because we are bound by space and time and we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2340" display="39:00" %}} - truly understand what all this means in the in the same way that we will in eternity when things are clear for us um  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2345" display="39:05" %}} - but that applies to everybody and we just need to acknowledge uh in humility that we will only understand up to a  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2351" display="39:11" %}} - certain point and again this doesn't mean that this Doctrine is illogical it just means it's super logical it exceeds  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2359" display="39:19" %}} - the bounds of what we can know um and so those are just a couple a couple points to bring up here in closing out this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2366" display="39:26" %}} - discussion the early doctrine of the Trinity maybe how it was discussed so even at the time  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2371" display="39:31" %}} - of the the Bible was being written there were already kind of incipient challenges to proper understanding of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2378" display="39:38" %}} - God and what he meant um I guess one other thing I kind of did this out of order relative to our discussion but we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2383" display="39:43" %}} - kind of talked about uh Believers in the Old Testament as well how some of these things um even though they're there in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2389" display="39:49" %}} - the Old Testament you know we we argued that that these things have always been there in the Bible uh this was one of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2394" display="39:54" %}} - those things that was arguably kind of veiled so Judaism cons always considered  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2400" display="40:00" %}} - to this day even to be a monotheistic religion a one God not Triune God just one God period um but people who read  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2408" display="40:08" %}} - the new the Old Testament honestly AI brought up this example in Zechariah there's also the Messianic Psalm Audi  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2414" display="40:14" %}} - also brought this up in our discussion uh well I guess off the recording but a Messianic Psalm where uh David's saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2420" display="40:20" %}} - and uh the Lord said to my Lord right what does that even mean if it's not trinitarian right um there would have  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2427" display="40:27" %}} - been people in the Old Testament who were looking at the text and were wondering what does the say about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2433" display="40:33" %}} - you know is there more here um but it was actually hidden from them um the so-called Divine Mysteries right this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2439" display="40:39" %}} - one of the benefits we have living in the time that we do is that those things which were once veiled are no longer  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2445" display="40:45" %}} - veiled um and all this to say we don't necessarily get to look down our noses  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2450" display="40:50" %}} - at uh such great Believers as Abraham and David and uh you know maybe Isaac and Jacob and so on um because oh well  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2458" display="40:58" %}} - they didn't understand the Trinity so maybe I'm such a great person now or whatever is because they lived in this time in which they had the same defining  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2466" display="41:06" %}} - faith that we have as Christians in their place and time and God had not yet unveiled all of these things uh perhaps  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2473" display="41:13" %}} - even to the angels there's this verse in First Peter that talks about how even the angels want to look into these things and so part of that obviously is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2479" display="41:19" %}} - the Incarnation of Jesus Christ and his death to redeem us on the cross but uh you know aspects of God nature and how  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2486" display="41:26" %}} - it interacts with creation all of this we don't know exactly but obviously for Old Testament Believers the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2492" display="41:32" %}} - maybe there was a progressive revelation that's the jargony theological term for this stuff that there was progressive  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2499" display="41:39" %}} - revelation here as it came to manifes in God's nature and character and the fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2504" display="41:44" %}} - that he's a Triune God doesn't mean that the Old Testament Believers didn't believe so uh that is some of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2512" display="41:52" %}} - discussed here uh to conclude this section good thoughts here and now we're going to turn kind of to wrapping up uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2519" display="41:59" %}} - this particular introduction to the doctrine of the Trinity before we jump into in future lessons uh some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2524" display="42:04" %}} - specifics of it or we're just going to go ahead and restate the doctrine kind of with a little bit more specificity  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2529" display="42:09" %}} - and that's what we're going to do in the next bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2534" display="42:14" %}} - here so just one last thing to talk about here in our introduction to the topic of the Trinity we've said that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2541" display="42:21" %}} - core definition of the Trinity is that God is one in essence yet three in person  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2546" display="42:26" %}} - and so I kind of said that we' we'd kind of wind our way back to this and aie actually he said this almost word for  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2553" display="42:33" %}} - word uh in one of the things that he was talking about earlier in regards to the middle portion but to kind of put this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2559" display="42:39" %}} - in complete terms when we say that God is one in essence and three in person what that actually means is that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2566" display="42:46" %}} - father is God the son is God and the Holy Spirit is God yet at the same time the father is not the son or the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2572" display="42:52" %}} - Spirit the son is not the father of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is not the father the sun um so um I tell you  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2579" display="42:59" %}} - what actually let me go find this I will we'll we'll we'll get to this picture later on um so I'm going to go find the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2586" display="43:06" %}} - uh section in the study here on ichus where we have the picture of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2591" display="43:11" %}} - um I know it's somewhere here I mean like we'll get to it some point here right this is exactly what we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2598" display="43:18" %}} - um that the father of the Son and the Holy Spirit are all God but they are not each other that is what three persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2604" display="43:24" %}} - one Essence essentially needs um so that is all there is to it this introduction  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2611" display="43:31" %}} - of the doctrine that is what we say we believe when we say that God is one in essence and three in person so Audi any  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2616" display="43:36" %}} - clarifications to make here um anything else to say about what it is we say we believe um and like I said we'll get  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2622" display="43:42" %}} - into all the specifics of this um as we move forward in the lessons but yeah I don't think I have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2629" display="43:49" %}} - further to see it's okay great so that is our introduction here um introduction  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2635" display="43:55" %}} - to the the doctrine of the Trinity and we will be going through um more specifics as we move on in the further  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2641" display="44:01" %}} - lessons in this study here so these are the things that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2648" display="44:08" %}} - covered here in our introduction to the doctrine of the Trinity uh first we talked about the core definition of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2654" display="44:14" %}} - Trinity that God is one in essence and three in person uh then we spent some time talking about uh the terminology  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2661" display="44:21" %}} - itself how the Bible itself speaks to the Trinity and even before people came  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2666" display="44:26" %}} - up with some of the terminology that we now employ um people believed this and they believed it because it's Common  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2672" display="44:32" %}} - Sense from the Bible because the Bible says things like Jesus Is God despite  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2677" display="44:37" %}} - what groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses might say you know it's what it's what John chapter 1 says and so because of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2683" display="44:43" %}} - this um we have these statements the scripture just presents as fact it doesn't it doesn't try to convince us of  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2689" display="44:49" %}} - them or logic um logic them into something we ought to believe it just asserts them it just States them and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2694" display="44:54" %}} - because of that people even before uh some of the so-called trinitarian  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2700" display="45:00" %}} - controversies happened people believe the Trinity because that's what the Bible teaches um and that is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2705" display="45:05" %}} - entirely an uncont uncontroversial position for us to take but it is the position we should take because it's in  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2711" display="45:11" %}} - the Bible is what the Bible says it's what people believed because the Bible clearly states it and so we'll go into  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2717" display="45:17" %}} - more of those places where the Bible clearly states it we did use as an example here Revelation 4:8 this verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2724" display="45:24" %}} - here saying holy holy holy the Lord God or sorry the Lord God the almighty he who was and he who is and he who is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2730" display="45:30" %}} - coming this three-fold repetition of Threes that if you're being kind of honest uh must be intentional and what  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2738" display="45:38" %}} - that points to us uh uh John the writer of Revelation uh you know writing under  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2743" display="45:43" %}} - the inspiration of the Holy Spirit included this and this is one such passage that we use that points us towards the Trinity um and then after  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2749" display="45:49" %}} - all of that discussion of terminology and how people kind of believe it and understand it because it's there in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2755" display="45:55" %}} - Bible and so so we don't need to get all worked up about uh you know did people only start believing it in the third  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2760" display="46:00" %}} - Century or whatever after all that we talked about um just how what this  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2766" display="46:06" %}} - statement of one in essence and three in person means is that uh the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit are all God yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2772" display="46:12" %}} - they are separate and distinct from each other you know we'll come back to this picture uh in the future lesson where it's actually referenced but um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2778" display="46:18" %}} - three uh persons of the godhead the Father the Son and the spirit are all God and yet they are not each other  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2784" display="46:24" %}} - that's what one in essence three in person actually means and so this is where we're going to this is where we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2789" display="46:29" %}} - going to stop our introductory video here and in the next videos we'll actually be picking up uh first off by  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2795" display="46:35" %}} - by stating some things that the Trinity is not um so we're going to be kind of defining what it is um by showing some  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2802" display="46:42" %}} - some things U uh also commonly debated uh in what we'd call historical theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2808" display="46:48" %}} - things that came up um some things that the Trinity is not and that will help us understand better what it actually is  
{{% timestamp videoId="8GMxPLPmj90" time="2813" display="46:53" %}} - and so that's where we will be picking up in coming lessons here

### Summary {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-summary}

In this lesson we kick off a series of discussions we will be having about what the Trinity is *not*, to help throw into starker relief what it actually is. This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that only one person of the Trinity is deity.

#### Our next several discussions: understanding the Trinity in terms of what it is *not* {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-our-next-several-discussions-understanding-the-trinity-in-terms-of-what-it-is-not}

Last lesson we gave the basic definition of the Trinity: "three in person / one in essence" or "one in essence / three in person."

We can better understand what the Trinity is by first considering what it is *not* in terms of the definition given above, so that will be our focus for the next several discussions.

<!-- --- -->

#### Key point: God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that only one person of the Trinity is deity {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-key-point-god-is-one-in-essence-but-that-does-not-mean-that-only-one-person-of-the-trinity-is-deity}

{{< /subjects >}}

God is *three* in person, and all three persons of the Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) are divine. Heresies of the past which have challenged the divinity of members of the Trinity include adoptionism (asserting that Christ is the Son of God only in the sense of adoption), the Ebionite heresy (teaching that Christ had only a human nature empowered by God's Spirit), and Unitarianism (which asserts the uni-personality of God, denying the deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit).

But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are deity. Compare: Is.63:9-14; Matt. 3:16-17; 28:19; Jn.14:16-17; 1Cor.12:4-6; 2Cor.13:14; Eph.4:4-6; 1Pet.1:1-2; Rev.1:4-6.

- [CT 2B: Seven Lamps of Fire](https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2B.htm#Seven%20Lamps%20of%20Fire)

{{% quote src="https://ichthys.com/mail-Seven-fold-Spirit.htm#:~:text=Well%2C%20the%20seven,Savior%20Jesus%20Christ." text="Ichthys" %}}

[T]he seven eyes are said to be "the Seven Spirits", and the Seven Spirits are described in Revelation 1:4-5 as the Holy Spirit, occurring as they do in-between the Father and the Son (please see the link: [in CT 2B, "The Seven Lamps of Fire"](https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2B.htm#Seven%20Lamps%20of%20Fire)). Although it is true in scripture that angels are sometimes described as spirits, these seven angels are said to be stars, but not spirits, whereas in the context the term seven-spirits is a synonym used for the Holy Spirit, demonstrating His perfection. The seven eyes on the stone I take to be the Spirit's anointed of the Messiah (the Rock), as in Is.11 (where the Spirit is likewise described in seven-fold fashion):

{{% ichthys-translation p="Isaiah 11:2" %}}
(2) And the Spirit of the Lord will rest upon Him (i.e., the Messiah), the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

In Revelation 5:6, the seven-spirits are said to be 1) "of God" (an odd representation for angels who of course belong to Him, but an important identifier for this otherwise potentially confusing designation for the Spirit), and 2) to be "sent out into the entire earth"; only God can be omnipresent; seven angels, no matter how energetic, would be hard pressed to keep track of all that is going on in the world at all times, even with large a group of subordinates.

Finally, and perhaps decisively, Revelation 3:1 states: "These are the words of Him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars". This verse distinguished carefully between the two, so that *ipso facto* they cannot be the same.

###### A deeper dive into the interpretation of Ephesians 3:14-15 {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-a-deeper-dive-into-the-interpretation-of-ephesians-3-14-15}

<!-- p="Ephesians 3:14-15" -->

{{% video-only-note %}}

Interpreting Ephesians 3:15 correctly depends upon translating the phrase πᾶσα πατριὰ as "whole family" rather than "every family". (Within its normal usage as an adjective generally, πᾶσα can mean either "whole" or "every." But when interpreting Ephesians 3:15 correctly, it is "whole" not "every" in this specific usage). And so it is that we understand that our global family of believers (i.e., the universal Church---the bride of Christ) "derives its name" from the authority of the Father, just how human families carry the names of their earthly fathers.

{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - hey guys so this lesson we are going to be talking about how all members of the Trinity are deity they are all Divine uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9" display="00:09" %}} - partaking of the shared Divine Essence and so uh in the last lesson we had finished our kind of introduction to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="18" display="00:18" %}} - doctrine of the Trinity uh you know that God is three in person one in essence or one in essence and three in person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="24" display="00:24" %}} - whichever order you want to take it those two things together are the fundamental definition of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="31" display="00:31" %}} - and so while the father is God and the son is God and the spirit is God the father is not the son or the spirit the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="38" display="00:38" %}} - son is not the father or the spirit and the spirit is not the father or the son that is the definition of the Trinity um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="44" display="00:44" %}} - and to help us kind of flesh out our understanding of it what we're going to be doing here um is kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="52" display="00:52" %}} - going through some things uh discussing about what the Trinity is not um so we're going to be talking about what it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="58" display="00:58" %}} - is not and that will help throw into sharper relief what the Trinity actually is at least that's the idea so this week  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="65" display="01:05" %}} - here we're just going to talk a little bit about that about why we're doing that and then we're going to hit the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="69" display="01:09" %}} - first point here about you know how the Trinity does not function and so that is that God is one in essence but that does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="76" display="01:16" %}} - not mean that there's only one person in the Trinity um or sorry that only one person in the Trinity is deity or Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="84" display="01:24" %}} - in essence um so we're going to be talking about as sub points here that the father is God the son is God and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="89" display="01:29" %}} - Holy Spirit is God um so they are all Divine um they all share in that essence of deity and so that's going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="96" display="01:36" %}} - mostly what we talk about this time all right so before we get any further we're just going to talk a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="104" display="01:44" %}} - little bit more about this idea here um so as we kind of started with in the introduction here last lesson we did  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="111" display="01:51" %}} - give the basic definition of the Trinity that three in person one in essence or one in essence and three in person and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="117" display="01:57" %}} - we shared the illustration of kind of the triangle Le here explaining how the Trinity Works in terms of its mechanics  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="124" display="02:04" %}} - and so in discussing it uh later on we'll get to some of the analogies that Dr luginbill uses um imperfect as they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="132" display="02:12" %}} - are um you know we will be examining the Trinity from multiple different facets but here to start uh having gone over  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="138" display="02:18" %}} - the basic definition what we're going to do next is try to understand the Trinity better by first considering what it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="145" display="02:25" %}} - not in terms of the definition given above and so hopefully this will kind of help us Flex out what we mean when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="151" display="02:31" %}} - say that God is three in person and one in essence um rather than just stating that and like I don't know that's great  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="158" display="02:38" %}} - maybe we can say you know repeat those words but we kind of have to understand what it means for us to believe it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="163" display="02:43" %}} - properly and so that's going to kind of be what our focuses in the next several discussions flushing out this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="169" display="02:49" %}} - understanding of what three in person one in essence means um in terms of uh particularly some false beliefs in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="176" display="02:56" %}} - past or or heresies that have come up to challenge uh the Orthodox understanding of the Trinity um and so that's kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="183" display="03:03" %}} - what we are going to be focusing on in the next little bit here um a do you have any thoughts on this approach or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="190" display="03:10" %}} - shall we just go on and get right into it I think we can go on and get into it all right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="201" display="03:21" %}} - great so the first one of these uh things that the Trinity is not or how the Trinity does not function um so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="209" display="03:29" %}} - of the first Counterpoint that we're going to be arguing against to help us illuminate what the Trinity actually is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="215" display="03:35" %}} - is this one here uh the key point being that God is one in essence but that does not mean that only one person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="222" display="03:42" %}} - Trinity is deity um or has a divine nature um so God is three in person and all three persons of the Trinity so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="230" display="03:50" %}} - is the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit are Divine heresies of the past which have challenged the Divinity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="236" display="03:56" %}} - the members of the Trinity include adoptionism this is a a past uh teaching or false belief of certain people and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="244" display="04:04" %}} - adoptionism asserts that Christ is the Son of God only in the sense of adoption so just how human beings have adoption  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="251" display="04:11" %}} - well Christ was adopted as the Son of God rather than being God of course that is a dangerous false Doctrine because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="259" display="04:19" %}} - you know our Salvation as Christians depends upon Christ being fully Divine and fully man paying for our sins upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="266" display="04:26" %}} - the cross as our substitute um and that can only happen if Christ was fully god um because um you know there's some  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="276" display="04:36" %}} - mechanics in the atonement there maybe we won't get off in the weeds but you know this is very important stuff right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="280" display="04:40" %}} - you can't you can't get these things wrong um so that's adoptionism um and then there was also something called the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="287" display="04:47" %}} - ebionite heresy uh teaching that Christ only had only a human nature empowered by God's spirit um so we're not going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="293" display="04:53" %}} - get into the nitty-gritty of some of these things you're certainly welcome to uh you know research them on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="299" display="04:59" %}} - internet find some some past teachings past a certain point they're mostly only useful for us in terms of uh kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="307" display="05:07" %}} - discussing what the Trinity actually is so uh Jesus was not adopted by God and Jesus didn't have and Jesus didn't only  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="314" display="05:14" %}} - have a human nature that was somehow kind of specially empowered he had a full divine nature as well um so those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="321" display="05:21" %}} - are the the things that kind of help us describe what we mean by uh you know all three members of the Trinity uh share in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="328" display="05:28" %}} - the divine nature or they're all deity it's well it's not these things right and there's a third one here as well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="334" display="05:34" %}} - that we're going to just briefly touch on that's called Unitarianism which kind of asserts that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="339" display="05:39" %}} - uh there's one personality of God um denying the deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit um and so uh there are probably  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="347" display="05:47" %}} - other heresies besides you know this is just a sampling that ikus had here to kind of make this point and emphasize  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="354" display="05:54" %}} - that God is one in essence but that does not mean that only one person in the Trinity is deity because they all share  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="360" display="06:00" %}} - in the same Divine Essence um so we're going to go ahead and read some verses here um there is you know quite a lot of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="367" display="06:07" %}} - scripture that we could probably pull in here uh we're certainly not trying to be exhaustive and that's going to be true  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="372" display="06:12" %}} - for all of the scripture we read for uh much of the support that we have in this lesson and the following ones here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="378" display="06:18" %}} - but we're just going to go ahead and go through some uh Ai and I may discuss some of the passages if we think them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="383" display="06:23" %}} - noteworthy um or maybe harder to line up with the points we're trying to make but um it's just good for for us to get in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="390" display="06:30" %}} - that habit of just tying everything directly back to the Bible so that's what we're going to do here um there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="396" display="06:36" %}} - quite a list here but you know there's nothing wrong with us keeping the focus directly on the Bible so that's what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="401" display="06:41" %}} - we're going to do for the next little bit here as we go through these lessons so I'll start here with Isaiah chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="407" display="06:47" %}} - 63 um I'll probably open these in a separate window just so I can see the full passage here um so Isaiah chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="415" display="06:55" %}} - 63 picking up at verse 9 UM and again this is establishing the point here that um all members of the Trinity are Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="425" display="07:05" %}} - so Isaiah 63: 9 through 14 so says in all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="434" display="07:14" %}} - in his love and his Mercy he redeemed them and he lifted them and carried them all the days of old but they rebelled  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="440" display="07:20" %}} - and grieved his holy spirit therefore he turned himself to become their enemy he fought against them then his people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="446" display="07:26" %}} - remembered the days of old of Moses where is where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the Shepherds of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="453" display="07:33" %}} - flock where is he who put his holy spirit in the midst of them who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="459" display="07:39" %}} - of Moses who divided the waters before them to make for himself an everlasting name who led them through the depths  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="466" display="07:46" %}} - like the horse in the wilderness they did not stumble as the cattle which go down into the valley the spirit of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="471" display="07:51" %}} - lord gave them rest so you led your people to make for yourself a glorious name so um this is Isaiah one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="481" display="08:01" %}} - Major Prophets um you can certainly see references in this passage to the spirit of of God and remember this is the Old  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="488" display="08:08" %}} - Testament um and uh we have discussed a little bit last time about how the Old Testament does speak of the Trinity you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="497" display="08:17" %}} - know the Shadows are there it's supposed to lead us to question um to maybe have a sliver in the back of our mind that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="504" display="08:24" %}} - there is more to this than you know there just being uh one God you know um uh uh in terms of monotheistic religion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="513" display="08:33" %}} - that there are there's something there right Ai and I kind of expressed that last week um so aie do you have thoughts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="520" display="08:40" %}} - on this passage and how we're tying it into um the point of all three members of the Trinity sharing in Divine Essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="529" display="08:49" %}} - yeah um not not much right now because I think this one is um it's it's almost as if it's focused  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="539" display="08:59" %}} - but particularly on the Father the angel of his presence is um not very he is there but he's not prominent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="548" display="09:08" %}} - the angel of his presence is is spoken of as you know essentially a messenger but a special messenger obviously we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="555" display="09:15" %}} - know that from other scriptures um then the his holy spirit of course the angle from which I'm looking at things is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="564" display="09:24" %}} - there are people who um are are very big on how there is just one person in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="573" display="09:33" %}} - godhead and he wears so many hats you know so once we are looking at such people this passage may not be all that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="580" display="09:40" %}} - convincing to them um ex except for the the fact that we talked about the angel of his presence and they dismiss that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="585" display="09:45" %}} - angel as being a separate person from God himself so but yes this is one very solid passage that tells you that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="592" display="09:52" %}} - Trinity was involved in what happened with the Deliverance of the um The Exodus generation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="599" display="09:59" %}} - of the of Israel so definitely there is much that is said right here um but it will take a bit of getting into tying in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="610" display="10:10" %}} - with other passages to demonstrate very clearly what we're talking about I mean and it's one of those things where you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="617" display="10:17" %}} - can see the trinity in scripture but you can also see where people throw it out right if they don't if they don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="625" display="10:25" %}} - interpret passages so for example here in verse 11 when we say he who put his holy spirit right um does that mean that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="633" display="10:33" %}} - it is you know we as Believers in the Trinity um and we'll get other passages isn't like it you know Rises and falls  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="641" display="10:41" %}} - on this passage alone but we would interpret this as you know the father sending the spirit right um and people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="648" display="10:48" %}} - who believe in a more monotheistic interpretation you know one person and the godhead would say well it's not a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="655" display="10:55" %}} - separate person it's just his Spirit we'll get into this more um and part of the problem is it's kind of hard to talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="660" display="11:00" %}} - about all this in terms of like right Doctrine without hitting all the facets at once this one specifically we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="665" display="11:05" %}} - trying to argue that they're all Divine we do have another lesson that we will be going through talking about how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="670" display="11:10" %}} - are actually all distinct persons they're not just modes or aspect of a single person um we'll get to that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="678" display="11:18" %}} - that's a next lesson but um you we'll keep going I I don't want to get blocked but I just reading lots of scripture is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="684" display="11:24" %}} - the correct approach to help us kind of get that context here so this one from the New Testament Matthew chapter 3 um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="692" display="11:32" %}} - so um very clear passage here for the the um uh sort of divine sunship is what we would say right this is Jesus's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="701" display="11:41" %}} - baptism by John the Baptist the spirit of God uh descending right so again this is mention of the spirit specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="710" display="11:50" %}} - but also Jesus is described here as the Son of God and we mentioned that there is this concept  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="716" display="11:56" %}} - of adoptionism um but but this passage doesn't say um you know actually I don't want to get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="723" display="12:03" %}} - too far off topic but there's this other passage in the Bible that talks about like this day I have begotten you do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="729" display="12:09" %}} - know what I'm talking about aie um yes Bo it's very vexing because people who get into some of the trinitarian  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="736" display="12:16" %}} - heresies talk about the Eternal beginning of the Sun and all that nonsense and what that passage is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="741" display="12:21" %}} - talking about is the Incarnation right but you can see here in the baptism that what we're actually getting at is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="747" display="12:27" %}} - Jesus is the son of God did become the Son of God he is the Son of God um so yeah I don't know if there's too much  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="754" display="12:34" %}} - more to say here but definitely a passage where you see the spirit of God descending like a dove uh you know very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="760" display="12:40" %}} - uh strong visual imagery here but also of course that well Jesus is the son of God you know very clear proof text right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="768" display="12:48" %}} - um so I believe Matthew 28:19 this next one this is the Great Commission um you know baptizing them into um I this this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="776" display="12:56" %}} - will come up again in one of the other lessons ich this uh talks about this preposition here being into um and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="783" display="13:03" %}} - the idiom of the name of or the person of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit we're talking about spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="787" display="13:07" %}} - baptism here although of course many people in the church teach that this is water baptism but what we're actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="794" display="13:14" %}} - talking about is baptizing them into the person of God um the the the Trinity uh in United um as the three persons um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="804" display="13:24" %}} - it's stronger the trinitarian connection is stronger when you understand that actually because you're saying that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="810" display="13:30" %}} - you're baptizing them into God as a singular person right they're all God um and that's different than just like it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - being some magic incantation you do when you baptize people with water um indeed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="826" display="13:46" %}} - indeed all right keep going so that there's that that um equation of the father to the Son and the spirit in that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="835" display="13:55" %}} - passage which is very significant if if the the if the other two as some people like to say were subordinate to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="843" display="14:03" %}} - father then why why is it the name or the person of the three rather than the name or the person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="851" display="14:11" %}} - father that's yeah and actually in Greek this is what we would call probably I don't know like a Distributive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="858" display="14:18" %}} - construction I don't want to just make up words I don't know if that's an actual grammatical term but you can take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="862" display="14:22" %}} - the name of um you know the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit the name goes kind of all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="869" display="14:29" %}} - right it's not like you have the name of the father and then the Son and the Holy Spirit are separate it's the name of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="874" display="14:34" %}} - father and they kind of implied the name of the son and the name of the holy spirit this is why we get that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="879" display="14:39" %}} - preposition being into is so important um from like it's not a a wrote formula we're talking about the mechanics of of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="888" display="14:48" %}} - becoming part of the body of Christ baptism into god um and so you know like you said this passage will come back up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="897" display="14:57" %}} - um it's actually used in one of the other lessons is talking about the equality between the members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - Trinity like you were saying but I it's hard to discuss all this without getting to all of the bits but um we shall we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="908" display="15:08" %}} - shall carry on um so John chapter 14 this time um so this is Jesus asking the father for the helper right here you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="917" display="15:17" %}} - actually see again all three members of the Trinity this is one of those passages that's really hard to explain  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="924" display="15:24" %}} - of if there's obviously Jesus In this passage who we know clearly to be God in fact Jesus in my opinion is one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="931" display="15:31" %}} - easiest members of the Trinity I think the spirit is harder to see sometimes because you know in John chapter one you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="938" display="15:38" %}} - know the word being God is like it's it's right there right Very Yes um but here you actually see that Jesus who we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="945" display="15:45" %}} - know is God from that passage and others is asking the father um obviously separate from him right to give another  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="953" display="15:53" %}} - helper which is the spirit right and verse 17 says it is the spirit right right and the father can't be the Helper  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="961" display="16:01" %}} - because that doesn't make any sense and Jesus can't be the Helper because he's asking for it right you see this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="966" display="16:06" %}} - where it comes from um and I feel like sometimes people kind of what's the right way to say this they like they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="973" display="16:13" %}} - make light of the evidence that we have right in the Bible and so if you remember last time one of the points we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="978" display="16:18" %}} - made um that I said ikus makes is that ikus is very dismissive of this idea that like you can't get the Trinity from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="985" display="16:25" %}} - the Bible you know that it was like something that took for people to understand and believe or whatever like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="991" display="16:31" %}} - basically like no one actually believed in the Trinity until like the Council of Na or something I think that was 325 my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="997" display="16:37" %}} - days could be a little long but like that's just nonsense because like if you read this verse and I mean like does it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1004" display="16:44" %}} - help that we have church Traditions helping inform us of the doctrine of the Trinity okay fine sure but like it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1010" display="16:50" %}} - right there in scripture you know we're not making huge jumps in logic to get there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1016" display="16:56" %}} - um this is one of those it's right there yeah exactly as a matter of fact um I think I don't know if it was this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1026" display="17:06" %}} - passage or another but I faced off with someone some years ago who was insisting that Jesus is the father and the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1034" display="17:14" %}} - Spirit is is the same that you know he was going off of God is spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1042" display="17:22" %}} - spirit and in truth so he was like well if God is Spirit the father is the Holy Spirit and Jesus is the father and so on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1048" display="17:28" %}} - and so for it was I I faced off with when I was like when you look at this passage it's pretty it's like very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - straightforward was this passage and probably another one I will ask the father you it's not I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1062" display="17:42" %}} - won't ask myself I'm going to ask somebody outside of me and that person will give another helper that's helper  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1069" display="17:49" %}} - that's not me and very clearly if I'm asking this person for another helper I'm not asking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1077" display="17:57" %}} - this person for him himself yeah I'm asking for somebody else so if if nothing else this passage should make it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1085" display="18:05" %}} - very clear that there are three persons in view not one certainly not two so we have we never I think it's like when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1096" display="18:16" %}} - when Muslims would would quarrel with the fact that the Trinity is not in the Bible it's like why does it have to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1102" display="18:22" %}} - in the Bible we did not smuggle it into the scriptures this is what you read out of the scriptures  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1110" display="18:30" %}} - and for ease of communication we just named it the Trinity but it is a thing that's evident in the Bible itself it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1119" display="18:39" %}} - hardly worth a lot of talking about and I think this is why theology as a study on EES is so short because it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1127" display="18:47" %}} - these things are too obvious they are manifestly obvious once you look at look into the Bible for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1133" display="18:53" %}} - yourself yeah all right onwards you know what we will touch on all of this again you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1140" display="19:00" %}} - uh this first section I guess this section will be a little bit long as we go through but it it's not bad to repeat  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1146" display="19:06" %}} - ourselves some in establishing the points um so right uh the parallelism here this is uh the passage in Ephesians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1155" display="19:15" %}} - chapter 12 that talks about how even though we all have gifts our Ministries may be different actually important in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1160" display="19:20" %}} - not shoehorning people into like for example um in the modern Church uh people think that pastors have to be a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1167" display="19:27" %}} - very specific way that's just not there in scripture um but if you look at this we have three-fold repetition here right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1175" display="19:35" %}} - Same Spirit same Lord same God right who works things in all persons um you know I I would say strongest evidence is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1184" display="19:44" %}} - we have spirit and Lord here um separate Divine um yeah the second Corinthians chapter 13 verse 14 um this is one of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1195" display="19:55" %}} - those uh kind of I'm not sure if this is the very end of second Corinthians but it's kind of like one of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1200" display="20:00" %}} - benedictions here very common uh you know like I think Peter starts with one too that talks it mentions all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1206" display="20:06" %}} - people in the Trinity right um so beginnings and ends of a lot of the Epistles you'll see this um the grace of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1212" display="20:12" %}} - the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all right all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1218" display="20:18" %}} - of them are mentioned here directly um yeah yeah and again if you just think about this in terms of the analogies are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1226" display="20:26" %}} - imperfect but if you're kind of name not name dropping what's the right way um if you're talking about someone in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1234" display="20:34" %}} - their titles and their attributes it doesn't make sense to like mention the same person like three times like this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1239" display="20:39" %}} - right um you know like it would just be like uh it just is nonsensical the only way that this sort of uh this sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1248" display="20:48" %}} - greeting or this sort of um um it's the opposite of greeting like I'm thinking of like the the Latin word for I can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1257" display="20:57" %}} - think of the English one valuations valuations huh um but whatever what you say to people when you're telling them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1262" display="21:02" %}} - goodbye um uh that this formula comes up so often it just doesn't make sense unless you have the Trinity there um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1272" display="21:12" %}} - yeah yeah all right just several more um Ephesians chapter 4 verse chapter verses four through six um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - so you know one body and one Spirit one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all this one's actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1292" display="21:32" %}} - probably worthy of a bit more discussion because it seems to be emphasizing the Oneness here right um shared Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1299" display="21:39" %}} - Essence um but just because there's one Spirit doesn't mean that God is one in the sense of not having three persons um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1312" display="21:52" %}} - it's it's just one of those places where it's stamped again like all the other passages we saw one one common  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1318" display="21:58" %}} - denominator of all the passages that we saw is the fact that in in one piece of text you see three persons or at least  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1328" display="22:08" %}} - three times The Mention Of God in several different ways so you have like in this case one Spirit one Lord one God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1340" display="22:20" %}} - and Father you know you could make of that whatever you want but in the end there are three mentions here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - and these three mentions follow the same largely the same formula May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and uh the love  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1358" display="22:38" %}} - of God and The Fellowship of the holy spirit so we when you compare that to what we just saw in Ephesians 4 it goes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1367" display="22:47" %}} - um one Spirit one Lord one God and Father you you go back to Matthew 28 as well and it said in the name of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1377" display="22:57" %}} - father father and which we see in Ephesians 4 again where it says one God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - Father of the son and we see the sun replaced by Lord and of the spirit the spirit is a constant factor in all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1393" display="23:13" %}} - these so it's like you keep seeing this it's it's there and it's telling you see this and understand it it's right in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1401" display="23:21" %}} - your face it's not hidden anymore not like it was in the in the Old Testament it's right there glaring so yes not so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1409" display="23:29" %}} - far a field yes just just a point of clarity the word Lord here in the Greek is the Greek word cuos um so I pulled it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1418" display="23:38" %}} - up here here's a concordance that shows it and of note here specifically in terms of the parallelism that ai's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1423" display="23:43" %}} - noting is that this word here definitely referring to Jesus Christ right Spirit Christ God the father right like you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1430" display="23:50" %}} - said right there um now of course this word can actually be applied to God proper so for example up here uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1438" display="23:58" %}} - know as the Angel um you know uh like you see it used it where it's less clear that is is Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1447" display="24:07" %}} - but um it is used very clearly of Christ and you know in context here that's what we would understand this to be um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1454" display="24:14" %}} - yeah I mean like you said it's right there right um yeah I believe this is First Peter I think I actually mentioned  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1461" display="24:21" %}} - this passage this is another one of those another one of those things in salutation mentioned all three members  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1468" display="24:28" %}} - of the Trinity just super clear right why would you word it this way if they were all the same person you wouldn't um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1477" display="24:37" %}} - yeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't make a lot of sense to word it that way especially given all the repetitions  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1483" display="24:43" %}} - that we keep seeing I mean this is a lot of passages and they're all written by different people Matthew was written by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1492" display="24:52" %}} - Matthew we just read Paul we now see Peter there was John as well and all of them are following largely the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1500" display="25:00" %}} - formula y there is God who is also called the father there is Jesus Christ who is every every now and then in in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1511" display="25:11" %}} - different places replaced by the word Lord and then there's the spirit that's always the spirit so it's like I mean if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1519" display="25:19" %}} - this whole thing is puzzling to you it's got to say well there is something being said here that you should notice that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1527" display="25:27" %}} - one definite thing about it all right and last we're going to pick up this is another one of those greetings here you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1535" display="25:35" %}} - know mentioned the greetings and the whatever the opposite of greetings are called I think there's a word for it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1539" display="25:39" %}} - English it's escaped me um but um we have Grace and peace from him who is and he who was and who is to come right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1548" display="25:48" %}} - from the seven spirits before his throne from Jesus Christ and his God and Father right yeah yeah right there again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1558" display="25:58" %}} - um so um yeah this has been an excellent introduction you know we'll probably hit these passages they will come up as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1565" display="26:05" %}} - make other points about the Trinity but you can just see um by way of introduction even to these this concept  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1572" display="26:12" %}} - of things the Trinity is not it's all over the place in the New Testament um for sure you know that first passage we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1578" display="26:18" %}} - read that was in Isaiah too um it's it's more there in Shadows we talked about that right something that leaves a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1585" display="26:25" %}} - question mark about how exactly what is it mean for Elohim to be plural right is it just a plural of majesty or When God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1591" display="26:31" %}} - says let us make man in our image you know it's plural you know it's there it leaves that it leaves that tendency to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1599" display="26:39" %}} - be like what exactly does this mean um and then in the New Testament boom right here everywhere we see this this talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1607" display="26:47" %}} - about God in terms of Threes it's just all over the place um yeah yeah all right well that is our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1616" display="26:56" %}} - general introduction here to pull this back maybe it seems like I don't know that not all of these passages are so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1622" display="27:02" %}} - directly hitting this one about how uh God is all you know all three members of the Trinity are uh share the the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1630" display="27:10" %}} - Divine Essence they're all deity um one of the stronger arguments uh just to kind of close this out in summary is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1635" display="27:15" %}} - probably that that the one from the Great Commission you know we mentioned they're all mentioned uh if we expected  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1642" display="27:22" %}} - that one of them weren't Divine or that there was subordination within the Trinity they're they're kind of like all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - in the same breath here right the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit you know just you know one right after the other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1654" display="27:34" %}} - not the father and then I don't know exactly how else you would say it in the Greek if you were trying to show  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1659" display="27:39" %}} - subordination but not this right um I mean I think anyone who who has issues with actually seeing the equality of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1668" display="27:48" %}} - three can see that how ridiculous it would be to go baptizing them in the name of the father and of Angel Michael  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1674" display="27:54" %}} - and Angel Gabriel because at that point you instantly see the the Ridiculousness of what you've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1680" display="28:00" %}} - just done you've equated two wellknown subordinates of the father of God to God I mean right you wouldn't put them on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1690" display="28:10" %}} - the same level as the father but here we have the Bible actually saying it's like um when Paul says uh just like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1699" display="28:19" %}} - greeting we saw in Revelation just now um grace to you and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ like um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1707" display="28:27" %}} - okay would you say that would you replace Jesus with any other name there and have that make any sense you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1713" display="28:33" %}} - know what I think reminds me of this reminds me of a little bit um in history you know like when kings knighted people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1719" display="28:39" %}} - or whatever there's kind of like this ritual the formula that goes along with it or whatever or they're giving people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1724" display="28:44" %}} - rewards so they're like in the Name of the King you do this or in the Name of the King you do that now just imagine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1730" display="28:50" %}} - there's this dude off the street who walks in and says in the Name of the King and in my name you know well take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1737" display="28:57" %}} - seriously you know it's just like it doesn't carry the power and the authority and you know we talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1742" display="29:02" %}} - this when we were talking about God's Essence as the de facto and de jur ruler of the universe he is the king the king  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1749" display="29:09" %}} - of kings and Lord of lords that's what we're talking about here right and so yeah when we have this sort of and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1756" display="29:16" %}} - especially like I said the the argument we're making here in Matthew chapter 28 hits so much harder when you understand  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1763" display="29:23" %}} - that what we're talking about is spiritual baptism into the body of Christ not just a ritual it is uh yes I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1772" display="29:32" %}} - want to use the word ontological that's pretty strong philosophical Jaron but you know it's a matter of our who we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1778" display="29:38" %}} - our being um our station how we're connected with the body of Christ you know it's a it's a big powerful thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1784" display="29:44" %}} - and for that to be something that happens with all three members they have to be divine they have to be God that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1791" display="29:51" %}} - the only way it works um yes yes all right well I think we have discussed a lot of good things here but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1801" display="30:01" %}} - this is where we'll leave this bit and uh you know the next ones is not that we haven't already had passages here but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1806" display="30:06" %}} - we're just going to go establish that uh all three members of the Trinity are in fact Divine um that's where we'll turn  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1813" display="30:13" %}} - our Focus the next little bit all right so uh before we move on actually to the next slide in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1820" display="30:20" %}} - series uh we had some good questions about just clarifying certain aspects of the verses that we've just been going  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1827" display="30:27" %}} - through um so one of the first questions here um kind of getting at that concept that we talked about maybe people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1835" display="30:35" %}} - an easier time kind of intuitively understanding how the son is separate from the father um but the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1841" display="30:41" %}} - Spirit can kind of be tricky for us to wrap our heads around um you know we see these passages where he's discussed as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1847" display="30:47" %}} - you know the third person but what is it what does it mean for you know God to be spirit and yet you know we have God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1856" display="30:56" %}} - Holy Spirit and you know how exactly does that work I think one thing that will help us here is that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1863" display="31:03" %}} - fundamentally is not like us he's not like the Angels either so when we talk about human beings we say that we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1869" display="31:09" %}} - um the Flesh and the spirit um right we at least ik this teaches as do I um that we are dichotomous beings we have flesh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1877" display="31:17" %}} - and spirit um we are souls biblically speaking that word that we translate as Soul can also be translated as mind or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1885" display="31:25" %}} - life um and so we are uh flesh and spirit together compose uh who we are as individuals and that is what the soul is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1894" display="31:34" %}} - not to get too often the WS there but um point being when we talk about human spirits that is like the part of us that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1900" display="31:40" %}} - is not physical fleshly um but human beings are composed of both flesh and spirit in fact um it's an important  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1908" display="31:48" %}} - Doctrine in terms of our resurrection that we will be resurrected into bodies rather than um being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1914" display="31:54" %}} - incorporeal uh boy that's a big word um God fundamentally is God God's not like this right Jesus actually has a human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1924" display="32:04" %}} - nature it's very one of the things that ought to blow our minds about the Incarnation and the Dual nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1929" display="32:09" %}} - Christ being fully God and fully man is that he actually does have a human nature um but he also has the Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1936" display="32:16" %}} - Essence of God and that's what we've been talking about here um so maybe all of this doesn't maybe it doesn't help  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1942" display="32:22" %}} - right but what I'm trying to get at is that God doesn't have like I don't know like his his Spirit as something that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1950" display="32:30" %}} - like separate from his being generally not in the same way that we as humans do because our beings are not composed just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1957" display="32:37" %}} - of spirit um and also I'm trying to think about the right way to phrase this too we talked some  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1964" display="32:44" %}} - about how God isn't part of SpaceTime um and so when we say that Angels Are Spiritual they're also Bound by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1971" display="32:51" %}} - SpaceTime and I I I think we spent some time a you might remember better than me we spent some time talking about that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1977" display="32:57" %}} - right um a angels are not as constrained as we are in certain ways but they're also like they're not like God too um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1987" display="33:07" %}} - and so Angels Are Spiritual yes but they're also not spiritual how God is spiritual so I don't know if I'm helping  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="1994" display="33:14" %}} - much other than just saying God is very different than us right um and I think how we talk about it kind of conditions  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2001" display="33:21" %}} - maybe how hard it is for us to understand so a how about how about you go for a bit here see if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2007" display="33:27" %}} - it so I want to assure you that the way you you describe it is exactly right um the the spirituality of God the reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2017" display="33:37" %}} - John John chapter 4 talks about God being a spirit is to was specifically to tell the woman at the well of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2026" display="33:46" %}} - SAA that God was not limited by location the woman had been asking are we supposed to Worship in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2036" display="33:56" %}} - temple in Jerusalem or on the mountains and Jesus was telling her it makes no difference to God where you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2046" display="34:06" %}} - worship because he himself is not bound by any location that was what he was saying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2053" display="34:13" %}} - her so it wasn't so much that God is a spirit so that you start thinking well that must mean that God is the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2064" display="34:24" %}} - Spirit and the father is is the holy spirit Jesus is the holy spirit because the holy spirit is spirit it's talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2072" display="34:32" %}} - about what type of being so to speak and we have to be very careful about that word what type of being God is that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2081" display="34:41" %}} - what it's saying and that is to say strictly speaking the father is a spirit the son is a spir is a spirit the holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2094" display="34:54" %}} - spirit is a spirit so it's not that that God is a spirit and somehow we have to equate the father and the son to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2102" display="35:02" %}} - holy spirit for that reason now holy spirit is a title that the Bible has given to us for the third person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2112" display="35:12" %}} - Trinity it is not in any way a description or a definition of the type of God's being it's just the title given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2121" display="35:21" %}} - to the third person of the Trinity as a matter of fact the only name personal name that we have for God at all in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2130" display="35:30" %}} - scriptures is Jesus Christ Jesus not well Christ Christ is the title too and think about it that name is speaking of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2140" display="35:40" %}} - the fact that God is the savior of the human race we don't have a name in the scriptures just as my name is Odie and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2151" display="35:51" %}} - Steven's name is Steven we don't have one for God in the Bible apart from Jesus Christ we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2158" display="35:58" %}} - titles for God we have descriptive um uh names too like we the the closest you can get we have the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2169" display="36:09" %}} - you know the tetragramaton in that's what I was just talk about we have the the I am name but that I am name is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2178" display="36:18" %}} - speaking to what deity is and basically that was God saying to Moses I am the true God because I am  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2187" display="36:27" %}} - that which is and will always be and will never change that was he was made basically making a claim to Moses I am  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2197" display="36:37" %}} - the true God so when you go to the Israelites tell them that the true God sent you to them that's the the name by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2204" display="36:44" %}} - which I will be known that is I'm laying claim to deity and everything that calls itself deity is alive before me so we we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2214" display="36:54" %}} - get to hear God make a claim to what it is which is self-existence that he he exists entirely on his own will that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2222" display="37:02" %}} - is not subject to any external influence he will never change has never changed will never and and is not changing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2230" display="37:10" %}} - that's what he was saying to um Moses at that point and once once you you you understand all of this you come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2238" display="37:18" %}} - appreciate for example when um Jacob asked the Lord when he was wrestling with him what is your name and he said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2245" display="37:25" %}} - why do you ask him my name saying it's too wonderful for you you you you can't know me that intimately just yet because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2254" display="37:34" %}} - that that degree of intimacy is too much for you to bear and and it's true we can't bear it in the flesh it will take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2260" display="37:40" %}} - our actually um being removed from this body or being in the resurrection body we basically have to be outside of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2268" display="37:48" %}} - flesh to be able to experience God in that degree of intimacy but the point is that when the Bible talks about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2277" display="37:57" %}} - being a spirit it's not saying God is the holy spirit it's saying that that is the type of being that he is now just as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2288" display="38:08" %}} - Stephen has said too there's a difference between God's spirituality and spirituality of everything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2293" display="38:13" %}} - exists and we have to be very clear about this apart from Flora I think that refers to plant life everything else on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2302" display="38:22" %}} - Earth has a spirit that's that's one thing we have to pay attention to Ecclesiastes is very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2308" display="38:28" %}} - clear that even animals possess a spirit so um angels are spirits human beings are spirits that live in in bodies you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2318" display="38:38" %}} - know can I cut in here for a sec I think this will really help it's because spirit in the Bible I pulled up both the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2324" display="38:44" %}} - Hebrew word here ruak and the Greek word Numa both of these and this is such a such a huge thing and it's you can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2332" display="38:52" %}} - miss it because the same word used for Spirit in both the old test and the New Testament they have the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2338" display="38:58" %}} - connotations even across the two languages and Greek and Hebrew are very dissimilar languages right Hebrew is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2342" display="39:02" %}} - Semitic Greek is indoan etc etc um but it means breath as well things that are alive have Spirits spirit and breath are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2353" display="39:13" %}} - synonymous now um Audie has been talking about the title and the the you know sort of this distinction between names  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2359" display="39:19" %}} - and titles the Holy Spirit as we've said it's a title and what it gets to um and this is one of those critical things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2366" display="39:26" %}} - when we talk about the roles in the Trinity uh the adopted roles that how we relate to the Trinity um in their plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2372" display="39:32" %}} - for mankind the spirit is the Unseen empowerer right just how the wind has its effects it's not for no reason that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2381" display="39:41" %}} - this title was chosen is what we're saying exactly exactly that's an excellent way to to describe that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - think that actually puts P to that question so um bottom line is when we see in John chapter 4 God is a spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2395" display="39:55" %}} - it's not telling us in any way that we should restrict the understanding of the godhead to just the Holy Spirit um I was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2404" display="40:04" %}} - going to point out too that there are different types of spirits so to speak there Angelic Spirits there are human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2410" display="40:10" %}} - Spirits there are animal spirits and then there is God God is a spirit in the sense of not being part of the creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2418" display="40:18" %}} - that he made he is not anything like the universe so his spirituality and the spirituality of angels are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2427" display="40:27" %}} - Worlds Apart they're not even similar in that sense because the spirituality of of angels was created the spiritually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2435" display="40:35" %}} - the spirituality of God is what he is it's an uncreated thing I will also say that I think yeah I I think one other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2444" display="40:44" %}} - point to make here um I'm just trying to put my finger on what I was trying to say earlier was that it God doesn't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2451" display="40:51" %}} - anything other than Spirit right and I made this point with humans right but it's not like you talk about the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2457" display="40:57" %}} - of God as if God exists you know as if it's just like part of God right um you know like God has some other thing and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2464" display="41:04" %}} - then God has his Spirit right God is Spirit you know in the in the Divine spirit that we're talking about here as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2470" display="41:10" %}} - distinct from the other types that Audi's mentioned um I don't know if that if that helps  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2476" display="41:16" %}} - but like you can't disentangle it is the thing and when we talk about the capital T Holy Spirit yeah that was a very good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2484" display="41:24" %}} - point particularly too because of when people say that the father sends his Spirit as if he has something other than  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2491" display="41:31" %}} - Spirit yeah he is spirit so if the father is sending the spirit it is Spirit sending Spirit that's just how it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2499" display="41:39" %}} - how that works there is no other but in terms of what we would call Essence or ontology or whatever to use the big  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2505" display="41:45" %}} - words but like but that's not even what those pastors are getting at when we say the father sends the spirit what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2510" display="41:50" %}} - talking about is the father sending the third person of the Trinity as the helper exactly and that's the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2516" display="41:56" %}} - that's the point that is just to say that it's not like the father is like the body something and the spirit is his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2525" display="42:05" %}} - Spirit I've heard those arguments and what you said really gets at the heart of them which is God is not made up of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2532" display="42:12" %}} - multiple parts and and one part of his is is the spirit that he sends forth or something of that sort what we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2538" display="42:18" %}} - saying essentially is that the definition of God in terms of type of being is Spirit that's what the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2547" display="42:27" %}} - tells us so we should stop thinking in terms of oh because the Bible says God is a spirit there must be some way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2555" display="42:35" %}} - reconciling the fact that he is called Holy Spirit and he is called father and he's also called Jesus Christ it must be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2562" display="42:42" %}} - that the holy spirit is the spirit of the father as if the father were an empty husk that has a spirit like we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2571" display="42:51" %}} - human beings we have a spirit or we are a spirit living in a body or something we are made of two comp components or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2580" display="43:00" %}} - something of that sort well just to just to rip on it even more it actually makes no sense from a I want to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2586" display="43:06" %}} - philosophical point of view maybe that's not quite the right word but if God is being and we just use this point that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2592" display="43:12" %}} - things that are alive have breath you see where I'm going with this right yeah how can God not be alive you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2599" display="43:19" %}} - know it doesn't make sense that's why God has to be spirit I hope I'm not pushing the the the words connotation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2604" display="43:24" %}} - too far here but you see where going right that there's no way in which God is somehow not Spirit you know because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2611" display="43:31" %}} - that's that's what defines existence that's what defines being um yes at least in the Eternal sense um so yes um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2620" display="43:40" %}} - yes so that that that that makes a that makes a a great deal of sense okay um it looks like Lisa had a follow-up question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - so her follow-up question here was why couldn't the Spirit come while Jesus was here if they're separate beings so I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - don't think it's a matter of couldn't as this is more a question of why didn't the father send the spirit until after  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2645" display="44:05" %}} - Jesus was ascended and that's not a matter of could or could not that's a matter of God's choice in perfect timing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2653" display="44:13" %}} - right because God go ahead sorry I'm sorry I'm cutting in but the Holy Spirit was actually here on Earth with Jesus at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2662" display="44:22" %}} - the same time not only was he he actually I mean the Bible tells us the spirit of God came to rest upon Jesus at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2669" display="44:29" %}} - at the baptism there was also the fact that the disciples were sent forth with a portion of the spirit on them there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2678" display="44:38" %}} - was John the Baptist at the same time whom of whom it was recorded in Luke that the spirit of God was upon him from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2688" display="44:48" %}} - the womb so I'm not sure I'm not sure we have any basis on which to say that the Holy Spirit was not here at this same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2696" display="44:56" %}} - time that Jesus was they were both on Earth I know I know what the question is getting at though right why didn't the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2703" display="45:03" %}} - Holy Spirit personally indwell most humans until after Pentecost right I it's more along the lines right because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2710" display="45:10" %}} - even people in the old test like David had the Holy Spirit right um Samuel right prophets and we know that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2717" display="45:17" %}} - restraining Ministry of the Holy Spirit has always been present since the beginning and when it's removed I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2722" display="45:22" %}} - it's what second Thessalonians talks about it first Thessalonians maybe you know the remove  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2727" display="45:27" %}} - yes yeah um the removal of the Restraint of the Holy Spirit things will go south real quick and that is the impact of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2734" display="45:34" %}} - spirit being here spirit's always been here right but I I I mean I can't speak for Lisa but I'm guessing that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2739" display="45:39" %}} - question is more what about you know like when we have these passages that says that um Jesus is asking the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2747" display="45:47" %}} - to send the helper right um why why wasn't the helper sent before that maybe that's more where we're going here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2757" display="45:57" %}} - okay can we confirm confirm that uh although we will of course discuss that question as well but yeah Lisa says Lisa  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2765" display="46:05" %}} - says that's what it is yeah okay so go on then uh well more to me I think this gets into the wisdom of the plan of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2775" display="46:15" %}} - um you know uh could people have been indwelt by the holy spirit before Jesus ascended answer to that seems to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2786" display="46:26" %}} - well I mean we certainly had people who acted under the influence of the holy spirit before this point right um I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2793" display="46:33" %}} - think part of it is that you know it's the whole Paradigm Shift of we are no longer under the law we're we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2800" display="46:40" %}} - dwelling under grace Christ has ascended we are positionally our sin has been blotted out in the Book of Life we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2807" display="46:47" %}} - right with the father reconciled to God and we have that Unity um I see the think I'm not sure that the phrasing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2815" display="46:55" %}} - could could not is necessarily the right way to look at this so much as it's a uh being sealed with the Holy Spirit under  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2822" display="47:02" %}} - the New Covenant is the sign of reconciliation with God maybe that's too hand wavy but um I'm interested to see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2830" display="47:10" %}} - what you say um okay so um there's John chapter 7 verse 39 and it goes but this he spoke  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2840" display="47:20" %}} - concerning the spirit whom those believing in him would receive for the Holy Spirit was not yet given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2846" display="47:26" %}} - because Jesus was not yet glorified okay so um the answer is right there might take a little bit of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2854" display="47:34" %}} - unpacking to actually you know see what it's saying but the answer is right there on the face of it Jesus was not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2861" display="47:41" %}} - yet glorified therefore the spirit was not yet given we know that in fact Jesus said to the disciples um the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2869" display="47:49" %}} - who will be in you he is with you now but he will be in you later that's what he said to them just before he went to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2877" display="47:57" %}} - the Cross that's in John chapter 16 I believe it's somewhere between John 14 and John 16  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2883" display="48:03" %}} - so what is this um he's not yet being glorified talking about let's remember what's going on in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2894" display="48:14" %}} - story We Are by Nature God's enemies we're Rebels and while some of us don't quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2904" display="48:24" %}} - well not some of us General we just don't really get what's happening the the relationship that God's Free Will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2912" display="48:32" %}} - creatures were supposed to have with him is one of intimacy it's symbolized by marriage the same way that a man and a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2920" display="48:40" %}} - woman come together and become one flesh that is literally there's no difference between the two of them they're in such  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2927" display="48:47" %}} - Perfect Harmony that they are one thing and this is also what we see in the Trinity which is why Jesus said the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2935" display="48:55" %}} - prayer he said in John 17 that they may be one as we are one that they may be one with us so the idea is that we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2942" display="49:02" %}} - have this same Unity with with with the Trinity that the Trinity has in itself that's what God is aiming for he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2951" display="49:11" %}} - dwelling in us and Us in him that's what he's pushing for now because we were his enemies on what basis then would he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2963" display="49:23" %}} - grant us that Unity so when his Spirit was actually operating on uh prophets and kings and you know Believers of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2973" display="49:33" %}} - old times it was more like I'm doing that in view it's like a uh what would you call it like a credit a credit line  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2982" display="49:42" %}} - or something there's I'm giving you this because of a promise that has been made so Jesus was yet to come and die but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="2992" display="49:52" %}} - because that was a certain thing the Lord granted those uh uh bounds those experiences of him to those who believed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3004" display="50:04" %}} - but in fact that Unity that Binding Together that relationship that was going to be found by the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3013" display="50:13" %}} - coming into us to live in our bodies to share Fellowship in such an intimate fashion with us essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3022" display="50:22" %}} - saying to us you are like you are mine and I am yours that situation was never going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3030" display="50:30" %}} - be a thing in that way unless Jesus had paid the price for our sins and the the way we could know that that that um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3040" display="50:40" %}} - sacrifice had been accepted was that Jesus was going to be glorified that meant he had been restored to the place  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3046" display="50:46" %}} - that he gave up in order to pay that price that is God saying I accepted what you've done and it's wonderful come  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3055" display="50:55" %}} - let's go back to the fellowship we had you know I don't want to get off topic because we don't we don't want to go too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3062" display="51:02" %}} - far field here anyway but um there's this interesting idea in terms of atonement Theory um that's the word used  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3069" display="51:09" %}} - when we're discussing about what exactly is it that God did to reconcile us to himself how were our sins paid for um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3077" display="51:17" %}} - there's this interesting verse um I don't remember exactly I think it's somewhere in Romans that talks about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3083" display="51:23" %}} - you know if if Christ maybe it's not right I don't remember if Christ had not been raised we would have all believed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3088" display="51:28" %}} - for nothing right well if you say well if Christ already died for our sins on the cross wouldn't we have been saved  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3094" display="51:34" %}} - even if he wasn't raised from the dead I don't know if you've ever thought of that um it's one of those things where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3099" display="51:39" %}} - if you if you look at it and you aren't careful with how you phrase your question and how you understand what it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3106" display="51:46" %}} - means the glorification of Christ his the ra his raising from the dead and his Ascension to the father and and sitting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - at his right hand this is God's acceptance of the payment of the Cross right and so um you know God is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3123" display="52:03" %}} - it's not like he couldn't have not accepted it right um in the same way that a just judge would you know render  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3128" display="52:08" %}} - Justice in a case if if a crime had been paid for or whatever um or someone who holds a loan right a just person who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3137" display="52:17" %}} - holds a loan once it is repaid is not going to exact more from the person and so on um but the glorification of Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3145" display="52:25" %}} - is that stamp of approval on the work of the Cross and um just to kind of maybe round out this question a bit more the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3152" display="52:32" %}} - Holy Spirit indwells us after the point of spiritual regeneration once we have become part of the body of Christ we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3160" display="52:40" %}} - you know United with God through the indwelling of the holy spirit that happens on account of what Christ did  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3166" display="52:46" %}} - for us on the cross um so AI mentioned the whole credit thing with the Old Testament Believers um I don't even know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3172" display="52:52" %}} - how profitable it is for us to compare the you know the ministry of the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3177" display="52:57" %}} - upon Believers in the New Testament with the ministry of the Holy Spirit on Believers in the Old Testament I mean we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3181" display="53:01" %}} - know that it's mentioned is having some of these folks having the spirit of God do they have it in the same way that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3188" display="53:08" %}} - have it does it does it really matter you see what I'm saying like I mean like what exactly are the differences Etc is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3196" display="53:16" %}} - that important for understanding I mean like it maybe it's interesting to speculate about but I think the key not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3202" display="53:22" %}} - speculate when you look at Ephesians chapter 4 it's actually pretty straightforward that when he um ascended  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3209" display="53:29" %}} - he gave gifts to men right those gifts did not exist prior I mean yes there were prophets but there were no Apostles  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3217" display="53:37" %}} - there were no Pastor teachers there were Levites who were supposed to interpret the law and even among those Levites  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - they you you saw that it was a special case that you would see that the Holy Spirit came upon someone now consider  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3230" display="53:50" %}} - this fact consider this that Saul first king of well not the first King but still when the when the kingdom was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3237" display="53:57" %}} - established as a thing after Samuel he was the first king um Saul was a Believer right up to the end of his life  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3246" display="54:06" %}} - but there was a point at which the Holy Spirit was taken from him that's a very important difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3253" display="54:13" %}} - between Believers of that time and Believers of today if you don't have the Holy Spirit now in this dispensation in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3261" display="54:21" %}} - this era you're not a Believer any M but he was a Believer who had to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3268" display="54:28" %}} - function without the Holy Spirit and remember Paul David's very stringing cry in in Psalm 53 when he asked the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3277" display="54:37" %}} - not to remove his Spirit from him we have never we Believers have never seen what it is like to love the Lord and not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3286" display="54:46" %}} - have his spirit in us we don't know what that is like it's a horrible existence it's a very painful miserable existence  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3292" display="54:52" %}} - being because this world yeah I just going to say you know I I don't want us to get we we've already talked a good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3299" display="54:59" %}} - bit here um hopefully we've answered the gist of the question I mean I'm sorry to cut you off a bit here sure sure sure I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3304" display="55:04" %}} - have up on the screen here the verse this is exactly what Audi just said this is how we know New Testament that if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3309" display="55:09" %}} - anyone doesn't have the spirit of Christ they're not Believers um Romans 8 uh chapter 8 verse 9 but more what I was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3317" display="55:17" %}} - getting at was it that we can't know certain things about I my point was we don't need to go exercise our minds  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3322" display="55:22" %}} - about what exactly was different you know because one difference like you pointed out is that the spirit could be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3327" display="55:27" %}} - removed like it was removed from Saul and it can't today well that's a difference right but I mean I I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3333" display="55:33" %}} - know how how how how like useful it is to go compare and contrast what their version you know like how having the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3341" display="55:41" %}} - Spirit uh the blessing of the spirit or the anointing of the spirit um as David had for them is different than what all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3348" display="55:48" %}} - believers have now it's just the point is is that regardless for us the spirit was given because of Christ's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3355" display="55:55" %}} - glorification because of the acceptance of his payment that's kind of the the answer to the the underlying question I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3362" display="56:02" %}} - think so let's pause for a sec make sure we we kind of got all the uh points hit on that one so that's where we're going  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3371" display="56:11" %}} - to close out here this conversation about um uh the spirit of God and and how does God have the spirit and is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3378" display="56:18" %}} - different from the Holy Spirit and also why wasn't the Holy Spirit sent um until the Ascension um and now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3385" display="56:25" %}} - turn to discussing the Sevenfold spirit of God as it's mentioned in Revelation so this was kind of where we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3393" display="56:33" %}} - were going to pick up next um in the verse that we were reading in Revelation which we were focusing primarily upon uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3401" display="56:41" %}} - the aspect of three persons of the Trinity mentioned in this verse but one of the questions we had here when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3407" display="56:47" %}} - paused was um we have this mention of the seven spirits who are Before the Throne and this is here in Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3414" display="56:54" %}} - chap 1 1 veres 4-6 um of the seven spirits who are before his throne um and so the question was we kind of had a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3423" display="57:03" %}} - feeling that we recalled other places where we had these sevens come up um they come up in Zechariah Chapter 3  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3431" display="57:11" %}} - Verse n talking about seven eyes on the stone and then in the next chapter as well Zechariah Chapter 4 um several  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - places if we search for the word seven you'll see that it shows up here um and uh as well you know we just went search  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3445" display="57:25" %}} - so if you've never done this before you can actually search for things on ikas specifically using this search parameter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3451" display="57:31" %}} - you know you limit it to the site specifically and yeah verily there was a email question and answer on this and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3458" display="57:38" %}} - um Audi I don't know if you wna you want to give some conversation before um but ichus does talk about this point you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3464" display="57:44" %}} - know it talks about uh this passage here Revelation chapter one where we were um it cross references it with Isaiah 11  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3472" display="57:52" %}} - verse 2 um you know here seven the seven old Spirit of the Lord in Isaiah chapter 2 um and then in Revelation chapter 5 as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3481" display="58:01" %}} - well um yeah um I mean you could actually go to uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3489" display="58:09" %}} - ct2b that particular uh discussion he had there because that's where he went into the discussion but um it suffice to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3497" display="58:17" %}} - say that the seven spirits are not seven spirits they it's it's the Holy Spirit in the seven roles you might say he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3509" display="58:29" %}} - plays or the seven works that he he does so he has seven Ministries it's like how do I you could think of it this way that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3519" display="58:39" %}} - the holy spirit is doing one work one perfect work and in seven different Ministries and Ministry Services as as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3531" display="58:51" %}} - we know uh he he perfects this this work it brings it to Perfection so the the you would see that Revelation starts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3541" display="59:01" %}} - with talking about the seven spirits Before the Throne of God and then proceeds in chapters uh the same chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3548" display="59:08" %}} - one it talks about the seven lamb stands and the seven spirits of the seven churches then in chapters 2 and three it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3556" display="59:16" %}} - talks about the seven churches there's a reason that it's talking about things like this it's referring to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3562" display="59:22" %}} - Perfection of a plan that God has that the spirit is working out so this is what the seven spirits of God is really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3573" display="59:33" %}} - about it's not that there are seven Holy Spirits we should remember what we're talking about we're talking about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3581" display="59:41" %}} - and God is the infinite one you don't need seven of anything of him that's just the fact so we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3590" display="59:50" %}} - seven things that the spirit does to bring his perfect work to fruition not seven Holy Spirits it's not a really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3599" display="59:59" %}} - difficult concept to grasp unless we get often the way Weeds about it it says seven it says seven here and it's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3608" display="01:00:08" %}} - only the only place in the Bible where it actually states that explicitly and in fact in some translations you will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3615" display="01:00:15" %}} - see um the thing written as Sevenfold spirit of God we all have a spiritual appreciation a common sense appreciation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3621" display="01:00:21" %}} - of the fact that we're talking about the Holy Spirit and um as we see from uh Professor Robert's discussion of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3629" display="01:00:29" %}} - and I think this uh Q&A he says what I have up here we had up the Q&A here which links to the part of part 2B of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3639" display="01:00:39" %}} - the coming tribulation which we were at here which talks about the seven lamps of fire showing up in Revelation it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3644" display="01:00:44" %}} - actually also in uh here let me go let me go back it's also also in uh part five of the Bible basic series which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3654" display="01:00:54" %}} - uh the study the the Holy Spirit you'll see there's the section of the sevens here seven spirits lamps eyes seals same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3660" display="01:01:00" %}} - thing if we go back to this this is in that section lots of discussion about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3666" display="01:01:06" %}} - this concept as well so I will probably go ahead and post these links when I post the notes for this week because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3673" display="01:01:13" %}} - these are all good places to look um yeah yeah okay so it's bottom line we're not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3682" display="01:01:22" %}} - talking about multiple spirits of God we're just talking about the um Perfection of the thing that the holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3689" display="01:01:29" %}} - spirit is doing to realize the plan of God that's it the reason the seven is in view is because of what John is about to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3699" display="01:01:39" %}} - teach that's the the point in in Revelation 2 and three we kind of see it because uh the seven churches are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3708" display="01:01:48" %}} - actually seven divides in time of the progression of the church how the church is not really iterating but developing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3718" display="01:01:58" %}} - you could say and in each of these eras so to speak we see the Holy Spirit doing something specific at a specific time in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3727" display="01:02:07" %}} - preparing this Bride for the Lord and remember that the focus of all the work that God is doing before the return of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3738" display="01:02:18" %}} - the Lord Jesus is to replace the angels that rebelled that's the plan he has and what the holy spirit is doing toward  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3747" display="01:02:27" %}} - that is his ministry that's the work he is doing and it's captured in this Sevenfold description that we find in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3755" display="01:02:35" %}} - the Bible that's that's all there is to it yep I think that's a good way so that's where we'll wrap up this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3764" display="01:02:44" %}} - one so last question here from this initial set of questions we had after going through a lot of the scripture uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3772" display="01:02:52" %}} - to bolster the point we were making uh was this question kind of about how uh when we say that we are baptized into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3779" display="01:02:59" %}} - the person of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and Matthew chapter 28 verse 19 in the Great Commission well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3786" display="01:03:06" %}} - what does that mean exactly how can we be put into the person of God if God is divine and has all these attributes as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3793" display="01:03:13" %}} - we talked about in God's Essence before um we are not deity we can never be deity not in the way that God is and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3801" display="01:03:21" %}} - what does it mean for us to become part of the body of Christ Christ um I think let's start off by uh the wrong way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3809" display="01:03:29" %}} - looking at things kind of how we were doing with the Trinity here um so there are certain branches of of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3816" display="01:03:36" %}} - self-professed Christians who talk about us becoming like God being transformed to be like him there's this word in uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3824" display="01:03:44" %}} - particularly Orthodox theology called theosis um you may have heard that um some of this is more or less  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3831" display="01:03:51" %}} - objectionable because we are supposed to be transformed formed uh to follow after our our you know Jesus Christ as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3838" display="01:03:58" %}} - firstborn of the Resurrection we're supposed to reflect his glory so in a certain manner of speaking yes we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3843" display="01:04:03" %}} - going to become like God but not in you know ontological being not in nature um we will only ever be human uh even in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3852" display="01:04:12" %}} - eternity um now uh the book of Hebrews is very clear that uh once humans are resurrected and exalted at least Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3861" display="01:04:21" %}} - as the human Paul goes out of his way well if you take Paul to be the writer of Hebrews which I do U Paul goes out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3867" display="01:04:27" %}} - his way in Hebrews to show how Jesus is superior to the angels um in the resurrection State um but Jesus Is God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3875" display="01:04:35" %}} - we won't be God um so I don't want to ramble um to the the main thrust of this question uh when we are baptized into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3883" display="01:04:43" %}} - the person of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit we are baptized into the body of Christ we become indwell by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3890" display="01:04:50" %}} - Holy Spirit um this metaphor for us as as acting as one body gets to the unity of the church it does not mean somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3899" display="01:04:59" %}} - that we become I don't know this sounds super technical but we don't become like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3905" display="01:05:05" %}} - partakers of the Divine Essence in what some people mean by that um uh by a certain way of description that is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3913" display="01:05:13" %}} - we do as Christians by communion we are washed clean in the blood of Christ through his body and his blood but not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3920" display="01:05:20" %}} - in the way that people talk about that um you know it's not like we live upon I don't know eating the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3927" display="01:05:27" %}} - literal Flesh and Blood of God because people have very wrong ideas about communion and that um so I know I've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3933" display="01:05:33" %}} - gone a lot of different directions a you want to pick up any of the the threads I've introduced here and go with it yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3938" display="01:05:38" %}} - um I think you've really hid the nail on the head because when we think about well we're we're going to be made one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3946" display="01:05:46" %}} - with God but we're not going to become deity how does that make sense well think about marriage for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3951" display="01:05:51" %}} - example um we we become one with our spouse and if the Bible says that it doesn't really matter what anything else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3959" display="01:05:59" %}} - in the world says when you get married you become one with your spouse but the woman does not cease to be a woman and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3968" display="01:06:08" %}} - become a man and the man does not cease to be a man and become a woman we don't lose our personality we don't lose our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3974" display="01:06:14" %}} - makeup we just find ourselves in this very and it it doesn't matter how perfect that relationship is even if it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3981" display="01:06:21" %}} - was Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the the fall we still see that in that position Eve was Eve and Adam was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="3992" display="01:06:32" %}} - Adam even though they were one flesh so it's the same thing in our relationship with God when we are brought into this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4001" display="01:06:41" %}} - Unity this Oneness with him we don't become God and we should keep that we should keep in mind that it's impossible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4009" display="01:06:49" %}} - for anything that is not God to become God it's it's impossible plain and simple to be become God because God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4016" display="01:06:56" %}} - that which is that's it it it does not become and it did not used to be it is so we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4027" display="01:07:07" %}} - never become God and God is not never going to be other than God so it's not like God will become us he's always  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4036" display="01:07:16" %}} - going to be God but the thing is we will enter an a perfect intimate relationship with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4044" display="01:07:24" %}} - him where things that he has he can share very freely and fully with us that's this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4053" display="01:07:33" %}} - also where something that I've I've puzzled over for a little while starts to make sense I I thought for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4061" display="01:07:41" %}} - how how does one how does this thing that Paul said that in that day we shall know as we ourselves are are known today  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4071" display="01:07:51" %}} - we see dimly we see darkly as in the Mir era but then we will know as we ourselves are know when you think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4080" display="01:08:00" %}} - that this is actually hinting very strongly as at something that sounds very much like omniscience that is crazy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4090" display="01:08:10" %}} - how could we possibly contain that much information but this is and now I don't want to speculate on what that might  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4098" display="01:08:18" %}} - actually mean in terms of how we possess knowledge of that sort but it will be perfect knowledge is what it is it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4104" display="01:08:24" %}} - actually saying that we possess perfect knowledge but I don't know if it's perfect knowledge of all things or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4109" display="01:08:29" %}} - whatever but we will not have the difficulties that we are having today in understanding what God is about and what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4116" display="01:08:36" %}} - where we are headed with the Lord so here's the question then how do we have that only as a gift from the Lord now  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4125" display="01:08:45" %}} - imagine this that um you were adopted into a home they're very wealthy they have loads of books and they have loads  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4134" display="01:08:54" %}} - of cars and all sorts of things it's all there right now that you've been adopted into that home you have rights to all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4142" display="01:09:02" %}} - that you can pick up anything you want to read you can get in any car and drive you can sit at any table have any meal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4150" display="01:09:10" %}} - you want it's all yours now you have equal rights to it but it doesn't mean that you have ceased to be you and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4158" display="01:09:18" %}} - you've become the people that adopted you or that the people that adopted you cease to be themselves and became you so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4165" display="01:09:25" %}} - it's the same way we can look at this that we have been brought into an intimate relationship with the Lord such  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4172" display="01:09:32" %}} - that he shares himself with us without losing himself or us becoming something other than what we are you know I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4181" display="01:09:41" %}} - I think maybe the best way to get to this and this is kind of what I was trying to put my finger on when I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4186" display="01:09:46" %}} - started was that it's it's a metaphor it's not literal um and and I mean I'm laughing a bit here because this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4194" display="01:09:54" %}} - same problem that people have with the communion passage in John chapter 6 about eating the flesh and blood of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4200" display="01:10:00" %}} - Christ and they say well you see the Bible says is so therefore it must be somehow that we are consuming the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4206" display="01:10:06" %}} - essence of God or whatever you know which we we think is complete nonsense right we are memorialists it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4211" display="01:10:11" %}} - metaphor well so to is us being the body of Christ we are not literally ontologically speaking the body of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4218" display="01:10:18" %}} - Christ whatever but like where people get wrong is by that's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4227" display="01:10:27" %}} - metaphor it's what it's supposed to be we are the you know we are the bride of Christ we're also the body of Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4233" display="01:10:33" %}} - these things are metaphors right um marriage is supposed to teach us about sub uh uh submitting to Christ you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4240" display="01:10:40" %}} - that that is a direct analogy it's one of the reasons why the Bible uses this metaphor it's is very helpful in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4245" display="01:10:45" %}} - structuring our understanding but fundamentally it is a metaphor we are not ontologically speaking the body of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4251" display="01:10:51" %}} - Christ whatever that would mean um the fact that some people go there well I mean they're missing the point that it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4259" display="01:10:59" %}} - not it's not a technical description of God's existence his being that we're talking about here it's how we function  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4267" display="01:11:07" %}} - with that Unity what our relationship to God is um collectively as a group is as a wife properly submits herself to her  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4275" display="01:11:15" %}} - husband in marriage and the husband uh that is Jesus in this analogy uh you know loves his wife in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4281" display="01:11:21" %}} - self-sacrificing way it's supposed to teach us something right but it has nothing to do with about like God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4287" display="01:11:27" %}} - being or us somehow becoming one with God's essence or whatever else people kind of like get up to be right I mean I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4297" display="01:11:37" %}} - will add I will add this to that that um today we understand that we we want as children of God as Christians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4308" display="01:11:48" %}} - those who believe in Jesus Christ to be instruments of God's will that's literally what we want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4314" display="01:11:54" %}} - to be Servants of his will and if he wants things done this way or that that's what we want to do now if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4322" display="01:12:02" %}} - appreciate what that means that is precisely what it means to be the body of Christ we are agents of his will now  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4331" display="01:12:11" %}} - in in the in eternity when we have Resurrection bodies and God has filled all things just as Colossians says the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4341" display="01:12:21" %}} - idea here is that we are in such perfect harmony with God that what we want is aligned with what he wants so that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4352" display="01:12:32" %}} - actions we carry out the interactions we get involved with the way we treat the universe in which we live is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4360" display="01:12:40" %}} - expression of himself so we are not him but we become like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4368" display="01:12:48" %}} - um not just you could think of conscious tools you could you could think think of AI or but AI is a very bad analogy for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4377" display="01:12:57" %}} - this well not a bad analogy it's a good analogy but still it has limits the idea here is that we are conscious creatures  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4385" display="01:13:05" %}} - who are very happy being in ourselves the means of carrying out God's will in the creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4396" display="01:13:16" %}} - that he makes that's what we are trying to do today in our spiritual growth we're learning to align ourselves with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4402" display="01:13:22" %}} - the Lord and walk diligently with him every day that's why the Bible talks about our our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4409" display="01:13:29" %}} - being changed in the way we think so that we become like the Lord in the way we think so that he does not have to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4416" display="01:13:36" %}} - dictate to us as external things for himself but rather that because we are in such close um connection to him the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4426" display="01:13:46" %}} - way he thinks and the way we think are the same so what we want to do is what he wants done and we we become we become  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4435" display="01:13:55" %}} - the conduits the means through which he exercises his will in the creation that he made so this again leads us back to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4444" display="01:14:04" %}} - what Jesus said that he will be in us and we will be in him that's the idea this this very tight connection of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4453" display="01:14:13" %}} - Hearts is essentially what this is how Moses and I mean there was a relationship between Moses and Aaron but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4461" display="01:14:21" %}} - uh just going to to Moses Moses was to do what God Said and he did until yeah did until he didn't and so that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4469" display="01:14:29" %}} - that's the body what you're talking about what Moses was doing in obedience and what Jesus actually was doing in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4476" display="01:14:36" %}} - obedience is the body we we need to be no okay yeah exactly now Jesus in his kosis I would say that is a good way to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4486" display="01:14:46" %}} - look at it um in his divine nature he was always completely United with the father in essence but in his kosis  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4493" display="01:14:53" %}} - Jesus submitting himself perfectly to the father's will is exactly the unity that we're getting at here um I also say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4501" display="01:15:01" %}} - one other point if we are getting hot and bothered about this idea of uh you know us being united with the Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4508" display="01:15:08" %}} - Essence of God well what about the taking it the other way you know this is perhaps an easier more falsifiable thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4515" display="01:15:15" %}} - if we say that we are one body meaning that we are all perfectly United with each other well like just look around a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4523" display="01:15:23" %}} - little bit and you'll see that what some people seem to mean by that can't be true right um yeah because if if we take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4532" display="01:15:32" %}} - this thing as we collectively as a church are the body of Christ whatever whenever people get into making more out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4539" display="01:15:39" %}} - of that than the metaphor it is well in as much as we are one with Christ in that we are also one with each other and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4546" display="01:15:46" %}} - if you just look around I mean sure we as Christians are supposed to be more united than many other people in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4552" display="01:15:52" %}} - world that is a trademark characteristic of the church when it is functioning properly but it is not whatever those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4558" display="01:15:58" %}} - people mean right um so that's very true very true that's a very good test yeah all right well I think that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4568" display="01:16:08" %}} - a good place to leave this um when we are baptized spiritually into the body of Christ you know not the ritual of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4575" display="01:16:15" %}} - water baptism but the the meaning of spiritual baptism such that in Romans 8:9 it says that anyone who does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4581" display="01:16:21" %}} - have the spirit is not of God um what we are getting at is that we are made spiritually alive we have that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4588" display="01:16:28" %}} - connection that the close relationship with God such that we submit to him and we respect his will and he loves us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4596" display="01:16:36" %}} - that self-sacrificing love uh that Jesus laid down his life for us but we have that tightness of connection and also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4603" display="01:16:43" %}} - that Unity with one another in the church all submitting ourselves to Christ that is what we're getting at for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4610" display="01:16:50" %}} - us to be part of the body of Christ um not that we are somehow you know like becoming God or um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4618" display="01:16:58" %}} - you know like linked to God in our being or whatever um you know past what it means for all of us to be created and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4625" display="01:17:05" %}} - dependent upon God for existence but um it it's just that idea of the unity we have with one another and with God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4632" display="01:17:12" %}} - through our submission um right all right well I think that's probably where we'll leave this one um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4641" display="01:17:21" %}} - good questions good discussion here on um clarifying some of the concepts that have come out in these passages as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4648" display="01:17:28" %}} - discuss the Trinity so having spent some time talking through some of the questions we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4657" display="01:17:37" %}} - had after going through initial passages talking about how all the members of the Trinity are deity now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4663" display="01:17:43" %}} - turn and look at some specific passages for each member of the godhead so first we're going to start with the father um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4671" display="01:17:51" %}} - so uh obviously the point of uh this particular lesson that we're going through is that all three members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4677" display="01:17:57" %}} - Trinity are deity all of them are Divine they are all God and so starting with the father uh we're going to look at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4684" display="01:18:04" %}} - some passages uh that kind of establish the Divinity of the father then the Divinity of the Son and the Divinity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4690" display="01:18:10" %}} - the Holy Spirit I'm just to bolster that point that all three members of the Trinity are God so we'll start here in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4699" display="01:18:19" %}} - Matthew chapter 9 or sorry Matthew chapter 6 verse 99 um which says uh this is uh Jesus in The Lord's Prayer  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4706" display="01:18:26" %}} - teaching us how to pray says Our Father who is in heaven Hallowed be your name um should be pretty familiar to most  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4712" display="01:18:32" %}} - Christians I'd think but the point here is that God the father is in heaven he is God right um because beings in heaven  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4721" display="01:18:41" %}} - I mean I suppose we'd say angels are in heaven too but very clearly this is an indirect support for the father being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4728" display="01:18:48" %}} - Divine um the father being God uh so a do you have much to say there I mean I think that one is pretty straightforward  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4735" display="01:18:55" %}} - honestly um yeah like you said pretty straightforward um I think the key thing is our father yeah he is in heaven um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4744" display="01:19:04" %}} - are the Angels but our father and then the next thing is May your name be holy yeah or May the Holiness of your name be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4753" display="01:19:13" %}} - preserved or something of that sort and that is particularly speaking to the uniqueness of his person right now we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4762" display="01:19:22" %}} - talked about this the last couple times but when we talk about God's name the Holy Name Of God you know as in Exodus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4768" display="01:19:28" %}} - chapter 3 that completely gets to God as deity AI has I think done a good job explaining this uh several times we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4777" display="01:19:37" %}} - talked about it is that God is existence right is the very thing that makes him God is that quality of isness and that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4786" display="01:19:46" %}} - the name we're saying is Holy right uh God's God's name God's existence as the being that simply is um so in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4795" display="01:19:55" %}} - the characteristic or quality of deity we might say um that is in fact entirely what is in view  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4802" display="01:20:02" %}} - here yeah we we we should keep in mind too that hot speaks to the fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4810" display="01:20:10" %}} - that God's name is unique that is Holiness is speaking to separateness being aart being not like other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4819" display="01:20:19" %}} - things so this is acknowledgement of the deity of the father yep all right next verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4827" display="01:20:27" %}} - here that Dr lugan bille uses is in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 says yet for us there is but one God comma the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4836" display="01:20:36" %}} - father comma from whom all things and for from whom are all things and we exist for him and one Lord Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4845" display="01:20:45" %}} - by whom are all things and we exist through him um so this is what is in grammar known as apposition um this this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4853" display="01:20:53" %}} - this phrase with commas kind of uh giving another way of re restating the thing that comes directly before it um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4861" display="01:21:01" %}} - so there is but one God the Father you know from whom all things are made like I you literally cannot make this verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4869" display="01:21:09" %}} - say anything other than the father is god um it's what the verse directly says um this is I I should I should interject  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4879" display="01:21:19" %}} - here that of all of the members of the Trinity I think the father is the easiest to support as being God right no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4885" display="01:21:25" %}} - one ever thinks the father isn't god um most heresies in fact I can think of off the top of my head in the past we went  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4892" display="01:21:32" %}} - through several adoptionism for example or aryanism most of them deal with members  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4897" display="01:21:37" %}} - of the Trinity that aren't the father I I can't think of too many heresies off the top of my head where somehow people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4903" display="01:21:43" %}} - think the father isn't god um but nonetheless we're just going through dotting our eyes crossing our tees this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4910" display="01:21:50" %}} - is another Bible verse and I'm sure there's others besides the ones that we're going through that clearly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4916" display="01:21:56" %}} - supports the idea of God the father being deity of being Divine anything to say there Audie or shall we just go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4924" display="01:22:04" %}} - ahead and go on to the next one yeah nothing much to say either I think what you said is exactly right I don't think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4931" display="01:22:11" %}} - there's there's ever a question whether the father is God I mean you could say the father is Jesus you could say the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4938" display="01:22:18" %}} - father is the Holy Spirit you could say the father is the god from whom whom the Holy Spirit and Jesus proceed a lot of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4946" display="01:22:26" %}} - things have been said but I don't know of anyone who has a question about whether the Bible teaches the father is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4952" display="01:22:32" %}} - God it's pretty straightforward so so like you said dotting eyes Crossing teas yeah we just say here are the places  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4960" display="01:22:40" %}} - that the Bible says the father is god well so I I remember we we made this point um introducing this uh Dr lugan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4969" display="01:22:49" %}} - Bill stated and I agreed with him that the trinity is obvious from the Bible right um we spent some time and breath  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4976" display="01:22:56" %}} - discussing how it didn't just come about in the thir Century you know 325 Ad Council of NAA this wasn't like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4983" display="01:23:03" %}} - first time that people had like understood the Trinity from scripture um it's right there it's in the text it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4989" display="01:23:09" %}} - the common sense understanding of of how God is discussed in the New Testament and so what we're doing here is showing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="4997" display="01:23:17" %}} - you well here's where you get it right these are some of those passages by which the early believers would have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5002" display="01:23:22" %}} - understood that God is Triune in nature right from the text of the Bible uh we don't need tradition or church councils  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5009" display="01:23:29" %}} - to get this point because the Bible itself teaches it um that just is an important thing for us to keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5015" display="01:23:35" %}} - emphasizing as we go here is that we believe the Trinity not because a council of old men sat and voted about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5022" display="01:23:42" %}} - it but because the Bible teaches it um now a lot of people probably wouldn't say they believe it because of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5029" display="01:23:49" %}} - church councils but I don't know um we just need to be very careful in how we uh uh basically justify our belief in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5038" display="01:23:58" %}} - things because we know that the only true basis for our belief as Christians is scripture itself so-called solos  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5045" display="01:24:05" %}} - scriptura right that's a pretty fundamental Canon for us as Evangelical Protestants you know those are the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5050" display="01:24:10" %}} - labels that people would apply to us um and that's why we're kind of emphasizing this point so all that said uh next one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5059" display="01:24:19" %}} - here in Ephesians chapter 3 um so eans come on I'll click on the more link Ephesians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5067" display="01:24:27" %}} - chapter 3: 14- 15 um so says for this reason I bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5076" display="01:24:36" %}} - Earth deres its name um so you know another pretty clear straightforward um how could every  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5085" display="01:24:45" %}} - family in heaven on Earth derive their name if the father wasn't God it just would not make sense um this one might  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5091" display="01:24:51" %}} - be helpful to get a little bit more context to see what is in view here in Ephesians chapter 3 um so it's Paul  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5100" display="01:25:00" %}} - beginning a prayer here um praying for the Ephesians the church in Ephesus um so uh this isn't quite I don't think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5111" display="01:25:11" %}} - title is quite the right word it is a um uh Paul Paul using this phrase here um as a a description a qualifier of who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5123" display="01:25:23" %}} - we're talking about who God is and particularly how that affects us as humans here um so this isn't the only  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5130" display="01:25:30" %}} - place in scripture where this comes up um reasonably common actually you know for Paul or one of the other Apostles  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5136" display="01:25:36" %}} - you know Peter John writing to be you know God uh who has done this for us or who has affected these things um that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5145" display="01:25:45" %}} - God that's the one we're talking about actually I think pretty commonly comes up as God uh the god of your father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5151" display="01:25:51" %}} - Abraham and Isaac and Jacob right you know that kind of set aside this is the god this is the being we're talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5158" display="01:25:58" %}} - about that sort of thing but here just inferential evidence again that the father whom we are talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5166" display="01:26:06" %}} - about is most certainly god um I mean if if all the family in Heaven and Earth derives its name from him you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5175" display="01:26:15" %}} - know how we have family names that's to speak to his authority over Heaven and Earth so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5183" display="01:26:23" %}} - that is pretty I mean it might not seem immediately apparent to people who are looking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5190" display="01:26:30" %}} - for things to quarrel about but it's a pretty straightforward statement if if all the family in Heaven and Earth is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5198" display="01:26:38" %}} - deriving its name from the father then the father is the head of all this family yeah and that position is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5208" display="01:26:48" %}} - position now I will say that the English words father and family don't seem that related right um but uh you know Lis had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5216" display="01:26:56" %}} - mentioned this earlier when we were talking before the recording today well that is an English problem so to speak  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5223" display="01:27:03" %}} - um in Latin and Greek actually at least those are languages I'm familiar with family is intrinsically tied to the word  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5229" display="01:27:09" %}} - for father so um you know Latin P Patria right um this is what we speak these things are dead related to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5239" display="01:27:19" %}} - each other in the text it's right there um so if hit stronger in Latin and Greek is what I'm saying um this connection  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5246" display="01:27:26" %}} - between God the father and us as his family the family is the members belonging to the father so to speak  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5253" display="01:27:33" %}} - right that's how it works biblically in the biblical understanding of family and when we say that God is our father the F  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5261" display="01:27:41" %}} - the family doesn't exist apart from the father I mean I don't want to get into like philosophy or whatever but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5266" display="01:27:46" %}} - like that is the connection we have to God the Father um it's pretty strong is what I'm saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5272" display="01:27:52" %}} - um can you address can you address the name part of this deres its name aie you want to you want to take that or oh yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5282" display="01:28:02" %}} - okay okay um like I said it's like having a family name um most families are identified somehow like I come from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5291" display="01:28:11" %}} - the AR wo family in fact I come from the Isaac Car World of family so my family deres its name from my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5301" display="01:28:21" %}} - father the larger Clan deres its name from um our patriarch uh like my grandfather and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5311" display="01:28:31" %}} - then we have the Uki Clan which is my great-grandfather and so on and so forth so when we talk about the the derivation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5321" display="01:28:41" %}} - of a name we're saying who is it by whose identity a family is known that is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5329" display="01:28:49" %}} - head of the home the head of the clan and um that is that is God in this in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5338" display="01:28:58" %}} - sense we are Christians that's what the world calls us or called us back in the days of uh Paul in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5347" display="01:29:07" %}} - Antioch but you could call us Believers you could call us followers of Christ you could call us followers of the way  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5355" display="01:29:15" %}} - you call us whatever you will but in the end you're saying we belong to God's family and that is true of the angels as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5364" display="01:29:24" %}} - well and of those who have gone before us so that identity that we possess as members of that family derives from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5375" display="01:29:35" %}} - father and that is actually an argument or a statement of you know presupposed fact it's like well that's obvious since  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5385" display="01:29:45" %}} - he is God I mean I think this gets back to what philosophers would call the uncaused cause or the prime mover you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5394" display="01:29:54" %}} - want to use that word from philosophy you know people get their names from somewhere right and if you think of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5402" display="01:30:02" %}} - human uh the the tree of humanity you know starting with Adam and Eve throughout history um families derive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5410" display="01:30:10" %}} - from you know an initial starting point again after the flood um where Noah and his family survived and repopulated the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5417" display="01:30:17" %}} - Earth well even all of those people didn't come from nowhere they came from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5422" display="01:30:22" %}} - all of existence um and I I mean I don't want to stretch it right this passage is clearly talking about the idea of family  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5431" display="01:30:31" %}} - what does that mean for us to be the family of God right we are not literally like I I don't you know like how uh for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5439" display="01:30:39" %}} - example like baby deer are still deer right well even though we are God's children we are not like baby Gods so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5446" display="01:30:46" %}} - speak um we we are in some ways you know we have the image of God we have choice we are Godlike in our Capac to choose  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5453" display="01:30:53" %}} - but we are not like God in nature um we spent a long time um in kind of the first core part of this series talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5460" display="01:31:00" %}} - about how God is completely separate from everything in creation um but where I'm going with this is that God is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5467" display="01:31:07" %}} - one being who doesn't himself have a father so to speak right the one being from whom all of the other families  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5475" display="01:31:15" %}} - derve um it's the uncaused cause now one thing I wanted to mention here I I I have a a family twist on this as well um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5482" display="01:31:22" %}} - so you've probably heard of last names like Johnson or Jacobson right in my own family I have a lot of relatives from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5489" display="01:31:29" %}} - Norway there is a group of folks on my dad's side who still live in rural Illinois and they are the spencon and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5497" display="01:31:37" %}} - there was someone in my family history named Sven and then his family were Sven and his sons the sons of Sven Svenson um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5506" display="01:31:46" %}} - and so I don't know I I I find it funny because I know it's like my great great grandfather or something his named Sven  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5512" display="01:31:52" %}} - spencon um anyway um that is an example here of the family name being derived from uh uh sort of the the leader of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5522" display="01:32:02" %}} - family um I was that is that helpful Lisa um did we kind of get to the core of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5528" display="01:32:08" %}} - you're asking like why your names coming up here um yeah no I guess I'm still a little fuzzy because it's every family  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5534" display="01:32:14" %}} - it's not just the Believers it's every right in heaven and in Earth and now the the Heavenly they don't marry so they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5541" display="01:32:21" %}} - don't have like cousins and brothers and sisters I would be right I mean we we there's a lot we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5551" display="01:32:31" %}} - don't know about for example how angels are organized um so we know that there are clans of angels um you know the 24  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5557" display="01:32:37" %}} - Elders Before the Throne um Aus talks about in its Systematic Theology part 2A of angels talks about the Angelic  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5564" display="01:32:44" %}} - hierarchies and stuff um this verse like not to I I I don't think we need to go all that far down in the week reads  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5572" display="01:32:52" %}} - there um the verse is getting at that all groups of organizations right everything that we would call a family  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5579" display="01:32:59" %}} - and of course we have a human idea of what that means but all organizations derive back to God um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5587" display="01:33:07" %}} - is the one in whom everything exists everything has been created um I get that with the uh Authority structures  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5596" display="01:33:16" %}} - that he set up you know I think it's Romans that tells us to obey authorities so I can see that that is also implied  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5602" display="01:33:22" %}} - here yeah I think I think that um this passage is actually speaking Yeah I I don't like how the NIV puts it because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5614" display="01:33:34" %}} - um well could you could you take a look at the Greek and tell me what it says exactly please sure let me let me first  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5621" display="01:33:41" %}} - I'll pull up a different translation so this is nasb here says from whom every family in heaven and on Earth derives  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5629" display="01:33:49" %}} - its name I I kind of what I'm curious about is what this word is um so we are looking at Ephesians 3 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5637" display="01:33:57" %}} - 15 Ephesians 35 this is uh site that easily lets you pull up intral linear there are multiple sites  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5646" display="01:34:06" %}} - um Blue Letter Bible is one free online site that quickly lets you pull up an Interlinear or reverse Interlinear here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5654" display="01:34:14" %}} - so we are looking at this verse here so starting here this is in heaven or actually it's in the heavens plural  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5663" display="01:34:23" %}} - stative plural and upon the Earth Earth singular um interestingly article here this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5672" display="01:34:32" %}} - word I'm more interested in the every family part okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5679" display="01:34:39" %}} - so this right here that's the every family um Passa is uh adjective here for all and Patria this is a singular noun  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5691" display="01:34:51" %}} - meaning family so from whom this is this is the relative this is the relative Clause from whom every family in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5701" display="01:35:01" %}} - heavens and upon the Earth and then here's the verb um if if I wanted to say all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5711" display="01:35:11" %}} - family right if I wanted to say all the family in Greek how would I say it so okay this this word here pass pass upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5722" display="01:35:22" %}} - this is the adjective in Greek it can mean all or it can mean every depending on context here let me pull the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5729" display="01:35:29" %}} - adjective um so individually um each every any all um so okay that's precisely why I wanted  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5736" display="01:35:36" %}} - to find out because I don't like those translations now I think it is defensible uh you know not to get too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5742" display="01:35:42" %}} - far off in the interpretive weeds here it is defensible to translate this because it is family singular right it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5748" display="01:35:48" %}} - depends if you distribute this adjective or not um you do you make it each or every or do you make it all or the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5755" display="01:35:55" %}} - because if you were to translate this verse here as from whom the whole family in heaven and on Earth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5762" display="01:36:02" %}} - drives I I actually I see where you're going with this and I think that is probably the better translation there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5768" display="01:36:08" %}} - one single family of God right yeah and it's not it's not every every family on Earth there is just one family is it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5777" display="01:36:17" %}} - the family of see nasby actually footnotes it here um the whole um so if you take it in a Distributive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5783" display="01:36:23" %}} - sense it's every if you take it in a uh you know emphasis of the unity sense it's the whole um and this is why side  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5791" display="01:36:31" %}} - tangent not to get you off the weed this is why translation is tricky business right both of those things are valid  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5799" display="01:36:39" %}} - meanings for that word in Greek which one is meant well that is up for you as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5805" display="01:36:45" %}} - translator now this is why um there is a pretty famous quote from a guy named I think it's tacitus in Latin basically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5813" display="01:36:53" %}} - the translates to English is all translators are traitors um in English we don't have a word that can mean both  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5822" display="01:37:02" %}} - every or the whole like the same word means both we don't have a word that has that connotation both of them so we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5828" display="01:37:08" %}} - to pick one in English you don't have to pick one in Greek because the same word means both things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5836" display="01:37:16" %}} - um go ahead you were gonna say something oh yeah uh I think you're make very solid Arguments for the idea that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5845" display="01:37:25" %}} - um there are multiple uh meanings being held together in that one word so it doesn't have to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5852" display="01:37:32" %}} - be an either or the reason I actually come down pretty strongly on the um the whole or the all the uh family um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5863" display="01:37:43" %}} - interpretation is that um this is where we get yet another  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5872" display="01:37:52" %}} - uh insight into what God is trying is doing what God is accomplishing in creation there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5880" display="01:38:00" %}} - a family that he wants it's his family and as we saw right from Genesis most people wanted their own identity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5889" display="01:38:09" %}} - separate from him and that of course is what led him to or what led to the creation of Israel as a nation and we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5899" display="01:38:19" %}} - know that Israel is the church and the church is Israel and ultimately we are going to be sorted into the family that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5906" display="01:38:26" %}} - is Israel you know and so on and so forth so when Paul says this he is speaking to the God of all believers in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5916" display="01:38:36" %}} - Jesus Christ essentially pointing out that it's both the angels and believing humans who belong to this family who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5927" display="01:38:47" %}} - derive their name that is their identity from this father so he's speaking it's it's kind of again it's not like he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5938" display="01:38:58" %}} - arguing for this is uh this is how the father is God it's more like he's he's making a forgone conclusion man he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5945" display="01:39:05" %}} - obviously God because after all the the the whole family of Believers which is the point of all of creature history  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5955" display="01:39:15" %}} - right derives from him so I I agree you know I I don't think anything we were saying before was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5962" display="01:39:22" %}} - wrong but I would translate this if I pick one in Translation and footnote the other one see that nasb here translated  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5970" display="01:39:30" %}} - is every and footnoted the whole I would translate the whole and footnote every um that's how I would do it because it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5976" display="01:39:36" %}} - makes a lot clearer that point that Audi just made that we're talking about the the definite article family of God which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5985" display="01:39:45" %}} - is composed of both humans and Angels uh the elect you'll hear scripture use that word as well people who chose for god um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="5993" display="01:39:53" %}} - in who we have our identity um we derive our name we derive our identity from being part of that family the Eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6003" display="01:40:03" %}} - family self- selecting for god um so I really would rather we not go ahead I like it thank you you got it okay yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6014" display="01:40:14" %}} - uh let's go back to the passages we're talking about um so that we say at least mostly on topic here um so um we here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6025" display="01:40:25" %}} - have now covered several passages supporting um the oops wrong side of slides here supporting the Divinity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6032" display="01:40:32" %}} - God the father and like Audi said um you know we did a tangent a little bit there it was a good question I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6038" display="01:40:38" %}} - discouraging questions um but the reason why we were talking about this verse um uh aie said something to the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6045" display="01:40:45" %}} - Paul wasn't using this particular thing as an argument to prove God's deity like that's not the point of this passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6052" display="01:40:52" %}} - this is completely a tangential aside I mentioned it's kind of similar how uh people when referencing God will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6058" display="01:40:58" %}} - reference you know God the the father of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob it's like that it's just in a side of this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6066" display="01:41:06" %}} - God we serve and this God we serve is from whom the whole family of God deres its name um it's just that's who we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6074" display="01:41:14" %}} - talking about here so Paul very much takes it for granted that the father is Divine and eternal and you know the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6084" display="01:41:24" %}} - person from whom we all self-organize into the family of God like it's just it's he's not proving it he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6091" display="01:41:31" %}} - arguing for it it's just taking as brute fact um that was ai's point and I think that is the right way to look at this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6097" display="01:41:37" %}} - passage all right any closing thoughts here on this idea of God the father being god um not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6106" display="01:41:46" %}} - really I think I think you satisfied the point in the the discussion quite well and to be very clear like we said this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6114" display="01:41:54" %}} - is the easy one so to speak um people throughout history do not get tripped up by thinking that somehow God the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6121" display="01:42:01" %}} - is not God um or that he's not deity he's not Divine um it's the other members of the Trinity which have had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6128" display="01:42:08" %}} - more heresy traditionally in trinitarian theology so we will now turn to talk about the sun next and then we'll get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6135" display="01:42:15" %}} - the Holy Spirit after that next we're going to be talking about the Divinity of the Sun so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6144" display="01:42:24" %}} - second member of the Trinity here and just like the first one going to go ahead and be uh reading uh some verses  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6151" display="01:42:31" %}} - here to support this um one uh passage that really comes to mind you see this is the uh the verse used uh you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6158" display="01:42:38" %}} - kind of on the slide itself or in the in the study itself is in John chapter 1 uh the word becoming flesh and dwelling  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6165" display="01:42:45" %}} - Among Us the Incarnation of the word the Divine logos who we know is the son um because through him all things were made  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6174" display="01:42:54" %}} - going back here looking at this um uh this passage from 1 Corinthians chapter 8 that we just talked about you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6181" display="01:43:01" %}} - where this passage does say very clearly that the father is God you know just says it straight out but also talks  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6187" display="01:43:07" %}} - about how um in you know by whom are all things all things were made through him you'll see that used other places in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6195" display="01:43:15" %}} - scripture well that's what John chapter 1 says the Gospel of John the very beginning part of the go goel of John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6201" display="01:43:21" %}} - says that the world was made through him second member of the Trinity the agent Jesus Christ um he is the Divine log us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6209" display="01:43:29" %}} - he is the word this same one was present with the father in the beginning or was present with God in the beginning  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6216" display="01:43:36" %}} - talking about God the Father Here in context of this passage now of course there are people who they don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6223" display="01:43:43" %}} - translate this passage correctly right we got into a little bit about translation in our previous discussion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6229" display="01:43:49" %}} - just now about how um you know different words in Greek maybe we don't have an exact English  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6235" display="01:43:55" %}} - equivalent for the word and so you have to pick translating it one way or the other way well commonly in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6240" display="01:44:00" %}} - particular passage in John chapter 1 uh there's this thing called a definite article which is where we put the God so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6246" display="01:44:06" %}} - people will say Jesus is not God as in the god definite article he is a God uh group of people who does this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6253" display="01:44:13" %}} - Jehovah's Witnesses or jws well so happens that I'm not going to get into the the specifics of GR  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6261" display="01:44:21" %}} - but obviously we're talking about God the Father here um in context um they are a group of people who don't think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6269" display="01:44:29" %}} - that but they like their interpretation of this passage is heavily colored by presupposing that somehow Jesus isn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6275" display="01:44:35" %}} - God this is not the only place in the Bible too um so log rambley preface aside this passage here in John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6281" display="01:44:41" %}} - 1 this is the second person of the Trinity this is who we are talking about uh through him was the world made right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6289" display="01:44:49" %}} - I mean he was God in his own right you know obviously this translation we have up on the screen this comes from ichus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6295" display="01:44:55" %}} - what you see in Brackets is not present in the original Greek these are words or phrases that Dr lugan bill has added  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6302" display="01:45:02" %}} - that he views as implied and this is clarifying the meaning of this passage now if you read these verses with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6308" display="01:45:08" %}} - added bits the things in Brackets it becomes very very clear what the text is saying um if you read the Greek without  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6314" display="01:45:14" %}} - this or the English which comes from the Greek without this it's not maybe quite as clear but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6320" display="01:45:20" %}} - this is what the text means when we interpret it properly so some of those other passages this is why I say it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6326" display="01:45:26" %}} - doesn't rest upon this one alone that talk about Jesus being god um we'll start with uh John 5 Verse 18 here um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6339" display="01:45:39" %}} - this is a pretty clear assertion in the gospels in John chapter 5 the Jews were seeking to kill him because he was not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6347" display="01:45:47" %}} - only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own father making himself equal with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6353" display="01:45:53" %}} - God now this is a report but people were seeking to kill him because Jesus was claiming God as his own father making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6363" display="01:46:03" %}} - himself equal to God now if you read the words in the gospels you see this too but you know uh it's what Jesus claimed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6372" display="01:46:12" %}} - um with his own mouth and uh just as an aside from a argument for probability Jesus wouldn't be making this argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6380" display="01:46:20" %}} - wouldn't be putting himself equal to the father I don't know to like gain followers or something um you know so if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6386" display="01:46:26" %}} - you think about where's the motive in it if Jesus were lying about this he got crucified essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6394" display="01:46:34" %}} - because of this because he claimed to be the Son of God remember a you uh pilate put up on the gravestone you know here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6400" display="01:46:40" %}} - lies the king of the Jews and the Pharisees got really angry and they said no he's not he says he's the king of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6406" display="01:46:46" %}} - Jews right um well this gets to that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God he claimed that you know he and the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6414" display="01:46:54" %}} - were one that's another verse that we'll get to and it made no sense for him to claim that unless he actually was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6421" display="01:47:01" %}} - because if he was trying to claim that to get money or power or fame what it got him instead was it got him crucified  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6428" display="01:47:08" %}} - so that is not a good argument um anything to say here on this point aie um this passage in John 5 and just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6436" display="01:47:16" %}} - generally speaking Jesus claiming to be the Son of God and equal to the father just in his words and the gospels  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6443" display="01:47:23" %}} - generally yeah this is this is actually a passage that uh most people I have run into who have debated uh me on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6453" display="01:47:33" %}} - matter seem to have issues believing I mean how is claiming to be the Son of God making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6462" display="01:47:42" %}} - himself equal to God is is a person equal to his father simply because he is his father's son but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6471" display="01:47:51" %}} - but the point here is that the two are of a kind and then you think again about how how prophecy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6482" display="01:48:02" %}} - Works they knew that what he was saying was that he had come from God so that meant that he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6495" display="01:48:15" %}} - essentially claiming to be the Savior who was I I don't think I remember the passage well it's in Isaiah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6504" display="01:48:24" %}} - where he said I am God your savior your only savior something of that sort I'll try to remember it but my brain is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6511" display="01:48:31" %}} - glitching a bit so the idea here is if he was from God he was the Christ and the Christ was weird he was not a normal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6522" display="01:48:42" %}} - person by their estimation that was why um the disciples I believe it was Peter who said it uh said uh well we know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6532" display="01:48:52" %}} - when the Christ comes oh maybe it wasn't the disciples when the Christ comes he will remain forever that is he will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6538" display="01:48:58" %}} - continue forever because he's not supposed to die he's he's not like the rest of us who who are subject to death  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6546" display="01:49:06" %}} - they didn't see death happening to the to the Christ the Messiah because he had to be God or something very like God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6556" display="01:49:16" %}} - now Jesus was claiming to be from God that's the idea of being the Son of God he Pro he came from God just like a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6565" display="01:49:25" %}} - man would come from his father right well and it helps to appreciate uh the term that Dr Lugo commonly uses for this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6573" display="01:49:33" %}} - is prophetic foreshortening the idea is the perspective like artists might have this if you have a mountain range you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6581" display="01:49:41" %}} - only see the first mountain in the range you can't see the ones behind it right this getting to the suffering servants  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6588" display="01:49:48" %}} - versus the Conquering King thing all of the people at the time when Jesus came were waiting for the king to come  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6594" display="01:49:54" %}} - in and kick out the Romans but instead they got the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 and so you may hear this kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6602" display="01:50:02" %}} - poetically phrase stumbling over the cross when reaching for the crown right um for the Jews they didn't want their  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6610" display="01:50:10" %}} - Messiah to get crucified they wanted their Messiah to go beat the Romans right um sorry I don't want to get off  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6616" display="01:50:16" %}} - on a tangent but it's very interesting point of Prophecy here um and it does characterize what Jesus was claiming um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6624" display="01:50:24" %}} - like Audi was saying he was claiming to be the Messiah the Christ and exactly what the Jews of the first century  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6630" display="01:50:30" %}} - understood that claim to mean we are you have to understand we are culturally removed from this as well right um we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6638" display="01:50:38" %}} - aren't under the oppression of Rome for one thing but we are also not culturally Jewish we didn't grow up hearing you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6646" display="01:50:46" %}} - know stories read about the Messiah as you know the the person come to rescue our people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6653" display="01:50:53" %}} - specifically um this is one of the things that will make the regathering of Israel so powerful during the end times  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6660" display="01:51:00" %}} - is that the the witnesses the 144,000 the Revelation mentioned are for God's family for Israel eological Israel we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6668" display="01:51:08" %}} - are God's family now as Believers you know Israel and the church are one like Audi said Romans chapter 11 for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6674" display="01:51:14" %}} - um but it is strong stuff what Jesus was claiming when he said he was the Messiah um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6680" display="01:51:20" %}} - and you know so that point that aie made here about how is claiming that God is his father making himself equal to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6687" display="01:51:27" %}} - it is as AI said it's because he's saying this is where I am from um God sent me um that is the claim here uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6697" display="01:51:37" %}} - know and actually it's interestingly um you may hear this phrase in the New Testament kind of like um you know is is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6703" display="01:51:43" %}} - he of God or is he of his father the devil you know the uh Pharisees would say he was doing his Signs by the power  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6712" display="01:51:52" %}} - of Satan right um you know let me actually I I don't I I'm trying to think of the verse right off the top about his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6719" display="01:51:59" %}} - father there's a very specific verse I'm thinking of um so this is Jesus talking about how Satan is a liar and the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6727" display="01:52:07" %}} - of Lies devil um let's John 8:44 I I'm thinking of it people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6736" display="01:52:16" %}} - accusing Jesus of having his power come from sat um do you know what I'm talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6742" display="01:52:22" %}} - aie um or am I just yeah I do um yeah um he Stephen is it is it the one where um Jesus replies to them that Satan can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6755" display="01:52:35" %}} - drive out Satan is that right right right right right well that's not quite I want that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6765" display="01:52:45" %}} - context here let's try Matthew 12 so it's Matthew 122 27 or Luke 11:15 also Mark 3 yeah 2 to 27 I believe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6780" display="01:53:00" %}} - yeah so yeah okay maybe maybe it doesn't have the word father there I thought it did um by Prince demons  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6791" display="01:53:11" %}} - but you know like the idea being that if Jesus were sent from Satan he would be employing Satan's power he'd be an agent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6797" display="01:53:17" %}} - of Satan more or less and this is the opposite of who Jesus actually is right but it was kind of it was kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6806" display="01:53:26" %}} - driving home the point that to the interlocutors being sent by the person being an emissary um you know this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6814" display="01:53:34" %}} - another thing that boy we just have a hard time with the language here in English in our culture um you know in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6820" display="01:53:40" %}} - the Gospel of John how how you have all this stuff about Witnesses and Jesus goes on and on about how he was sent and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6828" display="01:53:48" %}} - the one who sent him do you know what I'm talking about and like it seems kind of strange to us reading this in English  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6834" display="01:53:54" %}} - like why is he why is he saying this why is he emphasizing this point and the reason why he is is because of what that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6841" display="01:54:01" %}} - claim means um so in English we'd be like you know if I I don't know like let's say I have a you know like a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6850" display="01:54:10" %}} - young boy who's running an errand for me you know I gave him money I say hey go buy me bread and milk at the grocery  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6854" display="01:54:14" %}} - store or something right he's been sent by me that is not the sense that Jesus means when he's sent by the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6862" display="01:54:22" %}} - right he's not he's not like an errand boy he is an emissary the very boy you know like best I I can't think of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6869" display="01:54:29" %}} - putting it better than Hebrews chapter one right um God's you know like in these last days he's spoken to us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6877" display="01:54:37" %}} - through his son right this is the son is the radiance of God's glory the exact representation of his being sustaining  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6884" display="01:54:44" %}} - all things through his powerful word it's the Emissary of God's power right it is not Jesus as Aaron boy it is Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6893" display="01:54:53" %}} - as the standing for the deity of the father um I know AI has made the point that within the Trinity which we'll get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6900" display="01:55:00" %}} - to a little bit further on in the study the father is seen as the representation of deity within the godhead Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6909" display="01:55:09" %}} - that deity represented to us upon Earth as the messenger um but it is the messenger carrying the scepter of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6916" display="01:55:16" %}} - king so to speak not like an under um so I don't want to ramble but this is important stuff in on on on Luke 11  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6926" display="01:55:26" %}} - verse2 it said but if I cast out demons with the Finger of God surely the kingdom of God has come upon you right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6933" display="01:55:33" %}} - you said Luke 11:20 or 20111 1120 okay yeah I flip the references there mine's NK nkjv on mine yeah I think that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6945" display="01:55:45" %}} - parallel passage to the one that we were we were looking at in Matthew chapter 12 right all right anything else you want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6953" display="01:55:53" %}} - to you want to say aie um I mean I I I do think the language of sent and being sent and the one who sent me um we could  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6960" display="01:56:00" %}} - go look at some references in the Gospel of John uh to examine that concept but it's very interesting and it gets to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6966" display="01:56:06" %}} - this point of what Jesus is claiming when he says he was sent by the father as the Son of God um yeah I I think uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6976" display="01:56:16" %}} - that's um that word was they like like we said they knew exactly what he meant to us today it would be a bit ridiculous  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6984" display="01:56:24" %}} - but they knew what he was saying because I mean while they in Jewish system they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="6994" display="01:56:34" %}} - would have understood that we ultimately come from God because he made us they also knew that the Angels could be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7002" display="01:56:42" %}} - called sons of God in the sense of their activity on behalf of God and their power and the domains and spheres of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7011" display="01:56:51" %}} - authori that they maintained for God but this one was not a son of God he claimed to be the Son of God the one who was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7023" display="01:57:03" %}} - true representation of the father's will so like they they knew what it meant they knew we today it's not really the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7032" display="01:57:12" %}} - way we think but it was the way they thought and they knew the the scriptures they knew prophecy they knew exactly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7039" display="01:57:19" %}} - what he how about the definite article Angel of the Lord from the New Testament or sorry  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7044" display="01:57:24" %}} - from the Old Testament it's the same thing um why shall we say cultural implication what he was claiming was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7051" display="01:57:31" %}} - clear so that to tie us back into the QED here so that when Jesus called God his father that's why they equated it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7061" display="01:57:41" %}} - context in cultural context they read between the lines and know and they knew that that claim was that he was equal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7067" display="01:57:47" %}} - with god um that's why the things are equivalent sorry we take a little bit of a round about path to get there but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7074" display="01:57:54" %}} - that's this verse um all right next one we're g to look at um John chapter 10 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7083" display="01:58:03" %}} - 30 pretty straightforward I and the father are one right Jesus claims it as well it's not like we just have to read  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7092" display="01:58:12" %}} - between the lines um so uh recall that we had just estblished that the father is God and if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7101" display="01:58:21" %}} - Jesus says that he is one with the father then Jesus Is God too that's how that works logic wise um so this is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7109" display="01:58:29" %}} - well beyond what a a typical Prophet would have said right sure I mean we would say that folks like let's say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7117" display="01:58:37" %}} - famous Old Testament prophets Elijah Samuel maybe they were given the words of God but what we mean by that is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7126" display="01:58:46" %}} - equivalent to them being God or basically they can't act like as if they have the authority of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7132" display="01:58:52" %}} - God they have not been delegated that Authority right so you might think about this of uh in Warfare times and places  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7140" display="01:59:00" %}} - throughout history the king might send an emissary a representative to conduct like an alliance for example with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7148" display="01:59:08" %}} - someone that person is acting with the authority of the King right but not every messenger has the authority of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7156" display="01:59:16" %}} - king see what I'm saying um there's this there's this sense of who is the represent in fact it's even stronger  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7163" display="01:59:23" %}} - than that in the parable of the vineyard you remember how the owner of the vineyard sends people to try to reason  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7171" display="01:59:31" %}} - with the tenants and then they they kill these people and then he sends his son saying certainly they will listen to my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7177" display="01:59:37" %}} - son right we have this idea of the son being literally the family representative right um you know in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7187" display="01:59:47" %}} - way that that people who simp simply work for you or not you know God sent his one and only son to us that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7194" display="01:59:54" %}} - stronger than God sending a beloved servant to us right although the Bible is very clear that Jesus perfectly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7200" display="02:00:00" %}} - followed the father's will right that that adopted kenosis Etc um you know like the Jesus's status as fully  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7209" display="02:00:09" %}} - submitting to the father's will but the point is is that Jesus had this Authority he was the representative of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7217" display="02:00:17" %}} - the father um yeah the full representation of the father's Authority they knew they knew um um in this case I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7227" display="02:00:27" %}} - and the father are one um whatever you think of the father is applicable to me whatever you do to me you do to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7235" display="02:00:35" %}} - father they knew precisely what he was saying that's why they tried to Stone him Jesus made the the claims based on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7242" display="02:00:42" %}} - this other places where anyone who Rejects My Testimony rejects the father's testimony right again again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7249" display="02:00:49" %}} - Gospel of John uses this language a lot um when Jesus says that it's because he has been given the authority right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7257" display="02:00:57" %}} - that's that's why he says this is because his words carry the very weight of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7263" display="02:01:03" %}} - God uh you know to use a close contrast I mentioned the Old Testament prophets Lisa had asked well this is definitely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7270" display="02:01:10" %}} - stronger than just the prophets right consider uh the John the Baptist um you know we use this phrase sent from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7279" display="02:01:19" %}} - you know this was something that the Pharisees went you know they were afraid that the people thought that John had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7284" display="02:01:24" %}} - been sent by God right this comes up in the gospels and so was John the Baptist asking or operating on God's power the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7291" display="02:01:31" %}} - answer to that question is yes of course but he was not the Messiah you know in fact John the Baptist goes well out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7298" display="02:01:38" %}} - his way to make that clear I am not even worthy to untie his sandals right um that's the difference in yeah St so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7309" display="02:01:49" %}} - speak of those we talking about yeah good stuff so next one um also John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7318" display="02:01:58" %}} - chapter 10 ver 33 you know this is making it very clear that Jesus was claiming to be God um you know if they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7328" display="02:02:08" %}} - were stoning him and he wasn't actually saying this he would have been like wait hold up guys um well I mean I say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7335" display="02:02:15" %}} - but there are other places like in John chapter 6 where he talks about eating his flesh and drinking his blood where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7340" display="02:02:20" %}} - everyone takes him completely the wrong way and he doesn't correct them right because the idea is people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7346" display="02:02:26" %}} - actually interested will ask what it means rather than just assuming and picking up Stones um but Jesus really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7353" display="02:02:33" %}} - did claim to be God as the thing um and so you know just another verse making it very clear that that's what everyone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7362" display="02:02:42" %}} - understood this to be um it it it wasn't like they got this out of nowhere right um that they were picking up stones to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7372" display="02:02:52" %}} - Stone him for his claims of being one with the father making himself out to be equal to God just like that they like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7379" display="02:02:59" %}} - they got them all wrong basically and that's why they were doing this right um now of course you know we don't want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7385" display="02:03:05" %}} - get too reductionistic in it but they knew this in a way that maybe like we've been saying isn't as so clear to us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7391" display="02:03:11" %}} - our cultural context but it is very much what Jesus was claiming um yeah and they understood it as such  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7400" display="02:03:20" %}} - um yeah and so basically the testimony of the of the actions of the Jews was to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7408" display="02:03:28" %}} - say we know what you're saying and we reject it and those of us today who go well um he didn't say it that's how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7416" display="02:03:36" %}} - understood it and they were wrong in understanding it that way but kind of missing the point I I I don't know if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7423" display="02:03:43" %}} - you guys know but there are people who are making an issue that um Jesus never claimed to be God in any part of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7431" display="02:03:51" %}} - scriptures well uh this was one of those places where he did make that claim and when they made this accusation against  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7440" display="02:04:00" %}} - him that he was claiming to be God his response was not oh you got that wrong I wasn't making that claim but he actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7448" display="02:04:08" %}} - told them well if the scriptures call those to whom the word of the Lord came Gods because you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7457" display="02:04:17" %}} - the scriptures say are Gods he says how much more the one whom the father has Sanctified set apart for himself the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7466" display="02:04:26" %}} - who is not like any other human this is I will tell you this is one of those things where it is the hardness of heart  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7473" display="02:04:33" %}} - that God gives us so much room to reject him because all these people are like like come on man just answer the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7481" display="02:04:41" %}} - question are you God yes or no and Jesus says for the Bible says ye are gods and how much more you see what I'm saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7488" display="02:04:48" %}} - like he doesn't answer yes or no um and he he does this on purpose though um this is the rhetorical strategy of Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7498" display="02:04:58" %}} - so to speak um he answers this he doesn't say it like that because it is supposed to get us to think about what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7508" display="02:05:08" %}} - this means to give people that opportunity to turn away um so yeah and and and even even further he did tell  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7516" display="02:05:16" %}} - them that he was God he told them I am the father or one you know this is actually it's it's the same the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7524" display="02:05:24" %}} - chapter this is the same two two verses before um yeah yeah he had told them I am the father of one and they picked up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7533" display="02:05:33" %}} - stones to Stone him and he asked them what did I do which good work are you stoning me for not for a good work it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7540" display="02:05:40" %}} - because you're claiming to be God well why is that a problem when God calls some of you Gods to whom the word of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7549" display="02:05:49" %}} - came I mean if he could call some of you Gods how much more the one whom he has set apart for himself the one who is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7557" display="02:05:57" %}} - unique among all human beings that will ever exist right this was one person of all the mass of humanity that God had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7566" display="02:06:06" %}} - set apart for himself there was no one like Jesus Christ before him and there will never be anyone like Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7573" display="02:06:13" %}} - after him this was the one person who was both God and man at the same time that's what was actually saying it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7580" display="02:06:20" %}} - very clear like actually this reading this passage together right these two verses Dr lugan is citing them you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7586" display="02:06:26" %}} - one after the other here but this passage they were stoning him because they said that it was blasphemy that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7592" display="02:06:32" %}} - was claiming to be like it is that's what that claim says Jesus said that that's what they thought it meant that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7597" display="02:06:37" %}} - is what it meant right exactly exactly exactly and of course I love I love the way that Jesus phrases this right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7606" display="02:06:46" %}} - they pick up stones to Stone him and he ask for which good thing I've done are you starting me um you know it is uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7614" display="02:06:54" %}} - yeah try but you know um anyway um John chapter 10 real clear right um next one we're gonna look at Romans chapter 9  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7626" display="02:07:06" %}} - verse 5 right this one's a little bit harder um I don't know how well this comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7634" display="02:07:14" %}} - through in the English but um who's are you know here let me I'm going go look at the full context  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7641" display="02:07:21" %}} - here Romans nine it's talking about Israel yeah being yeah but this this version let's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7651" display="02:07:31" %}} - see this is NIV um let's see what what version did we pick it up is nasb 95 probably a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7657" display="02:07:37" %}} - little bit more literal here it's probably closer to what the Greek says but NIV brings out the meaning more here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7664" display="02:07:44" %}} - that they're saying that the Messiah is God right um like this is is a I can actually check here if there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7671" display="02:07:51" %}} - relative pronoun in the Greek um let's check it's Romans but I'm just curious that's all um yeah so it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7682" display="02:08:02" %}} - depends what you take the antecedent of this pronoun to be right here so this is the Greek relative pronoun ha which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7688" display="02:08:08" %}} - we would translate in English as who it's called a relative pronoun it starts a relative Clause right uh relative  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7695" display="02:08:15" %}} - pronouns have what are called antecedents that means they point to something that came before um and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7702" display="02:08:22" %}} - question here is what does it point to well this noun right here hristos this is the Messiah Christ right um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7713" display="02:08:33" %}} - something along the lines of um Christ you know according to the flesh right who pointing back to Christ is how you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7722" display="02:08:42" %}} - should translate this this is where the relative pronoun points to which means this text I you know I Sor I don't want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7729" display="02:08:49" %}} - to get super technical there but the point is that this translation when the NIV here translates that the Messiah is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7734" display="02:08:54" %}} - the antecedent of this relative pronoun so that s we saying that Messiah is God that is the correct way to translate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7740" display="02:09:00" %}} - this um so yeah yeah and again that's not the point of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7750" display="02:09:10" %}} - this passage it's just there um you know like a just an aside about the Messiah the Messiah who is the messiah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7758" display="02:09:18" %}} - God overall um and Jesus claimed to be the Messiah therefore Jesus claimed to be God read yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7767" display="02:09:27" %}} - exactly all right 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 this is this one we saw the last time  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7775" display="02:09:35" %}} - too we said from whom all things exist and we exist for him that's the father and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7783" display="02:09:43" %}} - all things it's what we were talking about in John chapter 1 and we exist through through him we exist for the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7790" display="02:09:50" %}} - father exist through Christ you know clear reference here to John chapter 1 um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7796" display="02:09:56" %}} - yeah yeah yeah so just as all things um sorry what was that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7806" display="02:10:06" %}} - passage again sorry uh 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 yeah just as all things all things exist for the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7816" display="02:10:16" %}} - and from the father all things exist by Jesus Christ and through through him so that's that's quite an equation to me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7827" display="02:10:27" %}} - yeah and like I said I in my mind this is a very clear reference to the agency of the Sun in creation um right if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7836" display="02:10:36" %}} - say in whom when Paul says in whom all things hold together other places in in the Bible we kind of get the sense that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7842" display="02:10:42" %}} - he has the father in mind there but we know that Jesus Christ is said to be the agent in creation it's what John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7850" display="02:10:50" %}} - 1 says um yeah yeah yeah all right Colossians chapter 2 verse 9 I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7861" display="02:11:01" %}} - know this is why I'm chuckling I don't know how people somehow don't believe this right um just just read it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7870" display="02:11:10" %}} - Colossians 2 verse 9 talking about Jesus Christ here by the way for in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7877" display="02:11:17" %}} - form I mean like that's what we're talking about right um yeah yeah the fullness of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7887" display="02:11:27" %}} - deity that means he's God yes I mean like how else let me ask you people who oppose the deity of Christ what else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7897" display="02:11:37" %}} - does this passage mean if not that Jesus is god um you know and I'm sure they have their they have their their the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7904" display="02:11:44" %}} - ways in which they twist scripture to make it not so right I mentioned the Jehovah's Witnesses in John chapter one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7910" display="02:11:50" %}} - earlier squabbling over the definite article when it's very clear that the passage says that Jesus is god um so too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7916" display="02:11:56" %}} - here I'm sure people have their arguments all of which are complete rubbish I'm sure but this verse says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7923" display="02:12:03" %}} - that Jesus is god um full stop end of story um or we could look at a bit more of the context it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7932" display="02:12:12" %}} - confusing yeah I mean a lot of what we're reading doesn't require this is actually one Reon that the Trinity the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7939" display="02:12:19" %}} - the the teaching of the Trinity is not really that advanced it's not even an advanced Doctrine it's not something we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7946" display="02:12:26" %}} - need to you know know so much to understand it's pretty straightforward all of these things are claims that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7953" display="02:12:33" %}} - Bible is making explicitly about the members of the Trinity how each of them are God in this particular case um um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7963" display="02:12:43" %}} - sorry I I need to see that passage again uh we are in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 it's right here says for in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7972" display="02:12:52" %}} - Christ all the fullness of the deity Liv for yeah that's that's just not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7981" display="02:13:01" %}} - experience anyone else has this is unique to Christ that the fullness that is everything that is deity everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7989" display="02:13:09" %}} - that is deity lived in a bodily form it was well not contained but it was fully expressed right well this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="7999" display="02:13:19" %}} - is theology terms which we'll get to probably if we did if we ever get to christology we we'll get to this it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8006" display="02:13:26" %}} - called the hypostatic Union right um that's the theological jargon for fully God yet fully man how does that work  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8016" display="02:13:36" %}} - it's what that teaching is about yes important I heard this girl say that um one time somebody asked her about God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8025" display="02:13:45" %}} - and she said well if you've seen me you've seen my father and she was going off the you know that the spirit of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8033" display="02:13:53" %}} - dwells in her as a Believer but this is very different and that was wrong for her to claim  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8040" display="02:14:00" %}} - that I mean here's how I view it first Corinthians I think second Corinthians chapter 3 talks about us reflecting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8046" display="02:14:06" %}} - God's glory we mirrors right Jesus Christ was not a mirror he radiated God's glory actively see the difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8055" display="02:14:15" %}} - we reflect he radiates completely different things I don't know if that's a helpful analogy but um yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8062" display="02:14:22" %}} - you know like Jesus Christ is a light source we merely reflect light those are two completely different things um like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8070" display="02:14:30" %}} - Moon does the sun right good analogy too um but yeah you you're we are correct when we say that the fullness of deity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8080" display="02:14:40" %}} - living in bodily form for no one else does the fullness of De live in bodily form right that's not what it means for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8086" display="02:14:46" %}} - us to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit that's not what this is getting at this is getting at the second member of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8092" display="02:14:52" %}} - Trinity taking on flesh becoming a human being to die for us that's what we're talking about here um all right one more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8102" display="02:15:02" %}} - and good stuff yeah um Hebrews chapter 1 verse3 I think I quoted this before right this is talking about Jesus being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8110" display="02:15:10" %}} - God's last message to humanity I love Hebrews chapter 1 um these first few verses of Hebrews are some of my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8116" display="02:15:16" %}} - favorite just because of how strong they are this is the epicness of human history if you will right so we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8122" display="02:15:22" %}} - speaking of Jesus and why God sent him and he says he is the radiance of his glory his being God God's glory and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8129" display="02:15:29" %}} - exact representation of his nature and upholds all things by the word of his power when he had made purification of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8136" display="02:15:36" %}} - sins he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high so words here exact representation of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8145" display="02:15:45" %}} - nature this is another thing that is quote unquote Jesus only so to speak right we as human beings are indwelt by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8153" display="02:15:53" %}} - the Holy Spirit but we are not the exact representation of God's nature right um so and actually you know that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8162" display="02:16:02" %}} - that metaphor where we just using about Jesus radiating the glory of God and US reflecting the glory of God look at this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8169" display="02:16:09" %}} - right here says Jesus is the radiance of his glory let me pull that passage up from 2  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8176" display="02:16:16" %}} - Corinthians chapter I think this is talking about like the veil in Moses as well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8182" display="02:16:22" %}} - um uh you know we talked about this when we were talking about lightting Glory right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8188" display="02:16:28" %}} - um I don't know if this there's another passage I think that talks about going from glory to glory maybe that's here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8194" display="02:16:34" %}} - anyway point being Jesus is the radiance of the glory of God um the radiance of his glory that is different than us um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8205" display="02:16:45" %}} - Jesus here is expressely said you know we could go look at like I said I love Hebrews chapter 1 um but he's explicitly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8212" display="02:16:52" %}} - said you know first off to be sent by go oops Hebrews 1 not 11 um right now actually verse two very good reference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8222" display="02:17:02" %}} - for this too Universe was made through Jesus Christ right um yeah it doesn't work unless he's God uh but yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8234" display="02:17:14" %}} - yeah yes there really isn't much to say about all of all of this I agree I mean I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8241" display="02:17:21" %}} - don't it is not a waste of time for us to go through the passages though it's why we're doing also note also note  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8248" display="02:17:28" %}} - we've talked about this before uh compared to some of the other parts of this study in uh Bible basics theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8255" display="02:17:35" %}} - is kind of short and if you look it's not like I just skipped paragraphs I like I didn't copy into the slides for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8262" display="02:17:42" %}} - the points that we're doing here these are the points this is all that the study says um it just is literally a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8268" display="02:17:48" %}} - list of Bible references right because we have talked through some of this we're trying to explain to fill in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8275" display="02:17:55" %}} - little bit maybe get a little bit more picture of what these passages are saying but it's right there in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8283" display="02:18:03" %}} - passages right we we aren't we aren't going through a complicated set of steps to no you know find evidence for that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8290" display="02:18:10" %}} - which we are discussing um yeah all right well yeah uh I think that's where we will wrap this one um this has been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8299" display="02:18:19" %}} - establishing that the sun is divine the sun is god um so we started talking about how the father is God now we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8306" display="02:18:26" %}} - talked about how the son is God next thing we'll talk about is how the spirit is God as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8314" display="02:18:34" %}} - well so now we are going to talk about how the holy spirit is God so having talked about how the father is God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8323" display="02:18:43" %}} - the son is God we've gone through many scripture passages to help support these points we've made we are going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8330" display="02:18:50" %}} - doing the same thing for the spirit and in some ways as I know we have noted in our past discussions this is perhaps the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8338" display="02:18:58" %}} - one that trips people up the most that has a tendency to perhaps not seem quite as straightforward as the other two  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8347" display="02:19:07" %}} - members of the Trinity but as we'll see there are a number of passages that make the point clear enough that we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8354" display="02:19:14" %}} - have to guess at this it just like the other two members of the Trinity is something that is right there in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8360" display="02:19:20" %}} - scripture if we just have eyes to see so with that we're just going to go ahead and go through the passages just how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8366" display="02:19:26" %}} - we've done for the last couple starting with uh the actually the second verse of the Bible here in Genesis chapter 1 um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8375" display="02:19:35" %}} - now for those of us who follow ikus uh this is a familiar verse because this is the primary verse uh when you interpret  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8384" display="02:19:44" %}} - the Hebrew here for uh kind of translating formless and void uh also you know shows up in the book of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8391" display="02:19:51" %}} - Jeremiah uh the Hebrew here toou Vu can translate as ruined and despoiled and we have the the was here uh the Earth was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8402" display="02:20:02" %}} - um if you translate it a certain way based on the disjunctive Clause that comes after you can also translate it as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8409" display="02:20:09" %}} - became and so if you translate this as the Earth became ruined and despoiled suddenly that's a lot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8415" display="02:20:15" %}} - different right um so this is how ikus explains the Genesis Gap that's what this verse comes so not to get too off  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8423" display="02:20:23" %}} - on a tangent there but the operative Point here is that the spirit of God shows up in the creation narrative here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8429" display="02:20:29" %}} - in Genesis chapter 1 um and in fact if we go look at the rest of Genesis you know it is very clear that uh God is in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8439" display="02:20:39" %}} - view oops Genesis one uh God is in view during the creation narrative um so in the beginning God created the heavens  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8446" display="02:20:46" %}} - and the Earth and then in the very same breath as that statement then we have the spirit of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8453" display="02:20:53" %}} - coming in the next verse and then in verse three we have just God again and so it would be kind of strange here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8461" display="02:21:01" %}} - within the narrative for us to go from God to spirit of God who would somehow not be God and then God again uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8469" display="02:21:09" %}} - know in terms of what we would call narrative structure even if you have like a narrator or characters in a book  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8477" display="02:21:17" %}} - not that the Bible is a novel per se but you you just don't switch subjects like that uh especially going from one to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8485" display="02:21:25" %}} - other and then back to the the initial one in just a sentence later uh so this is what I would call strong inferential  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8492" display="02:21:32" %}} - evidence that the spirit of God is God that they are one and the same um now of course we know from the Gospel of John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8501" display="02:21:41" %}} - in John chapter 1 that the agent in creation was the son um there are other passages in the Bible that talk about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8508" display="02:21:48" %}} - how through him all things were made um or maybe that's in John too at any rate um the son is the agent of creation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8517" display="02:21:57" %}} - within the context of recreation at least that's what we would say Genesis chapter 1 is if you believe in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8525" display="02:22:05" %}} - Genesis Gap or the idea that we have the world has been restored after the Judgment that God rendered upon the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8532" display="02:22:12" %}} - universe for the rebellion of Satan and the angels um that the spirit of God is involved here in this chapter within the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8542" display="02:22:22" %}} - same breath within the same breath as God you know in verse one and verse three immediately preceding and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8549" display="02:22:29" %}} - immediately following um so AI do you have thoughts on this verse as it supports the point of the spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8559" display="02:22:39" %}} - god um uh not not really I think it's a pretty straightforward thing there is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8568" display="02:22:48" %}} - an agent so to speak someone who is actually doing something and then um we see someone else in view which seems to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8578" display="02:22:58" %}} - suggest that just like you said uh it certainly has to be well if we don't say the same person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8587" display="02:23:07" %}} - well they they are of a class they're of the same class um some God is doing the creating something happened to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8596" display="02:23:16" %}} - creation and God is still featuring we don't see any other person here so if the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8603" display="02:23:23" %}} - of God is here then um it's a pretty strong uh uh correlation being made here that's that's it's pretty much what you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8613" display="02:23:33" %}} - said so I don't really have anything for to add and I think maybe just to riff I know we've talked about this before I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8618" display="02:23:38" %}} - don't remember in exactly which segment but how God is not some sort of husk that is inhabited by a spirit right we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8625" display="02:23:45" %}} - talked about the differences between our makeup as humans where we have flesh and spirit combined we are dichotomous  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8633" display="02:23:53" %}} - beings uh spirit is what gives us life the word for Spirit in both Greek and Hebrew actually means breath uh we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8641" display="02:24:01" %}} - talked about all of this for the makeup of humans and then we said God is Not B uh God does not have this second part  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8648" display="02:24:08" %}} - like how we do as humans God is Spirit but when we talk of the spirit of God it's not as if the father is somehow the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8656" display="02:24:16" %}} - shell that Spirit resides in or or any sort of wrong-headed idea like that so uh you know just reiterating that point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8665" display="02:24:25" %}} - that we've made before when we talk of the spirit of God it is not as if we say the spirit of God is to the human spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8673" display="02:24:33" %}} - in a onetoone sort of correlation um it's not the same thing and of course Angels Are Spiritual but they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8681" display="02:24:41" %}} - different from both us as humans and from God so um I think we talked Over All that in the past but just making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8688" display="02:24:48" %}} - that point again so in my opinion actually there were there's obviously quite a few passages here this was one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8694" display="02:24:54" %}} - of the ones that I don't think it's maybe quite as clear it's inferential is what I would say um if you say somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8700" display="02:25:00" %}} - that the Spirit In this passage is not God then you have some explaining to do um I don't think it's as logically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8705" display="02:25:05" %}} - airtight as some of the other passages which we'll go through in a moment here so next one we're going to look at Psalm  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8713" display="02:25:13" %}} - 139:7 um we have established previous L that one of the characteristics of God is omnipresence we talked about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8722" display="02:25:22" %}} - running away from God is futile just like Jonah because no matter where you go God is there um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8729" display="02:25:29" %}} - omnipresence is this idea that within material creation God is everywhere um and here in Psalm 139 we see that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8740" display="02:25:40" %}} - spirit here of God has this quality which as we have argued in the other section is what we would call an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8749" display="02:25:49" %}} - essential characteristic of God um at least in applied with respect to Creation you know the essential  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8755" display="02:25:55" %}} - characteristic I suppose we would say is immeasurability but within creation that manifests as omnipresence and so if that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8762" display="02:26:02" %}} - is something that characterizes God and the spirit has that then the spirit is God QED sort of how this verse supports  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8770" display="02:26:10" %}} - the idea um anything more you want to you want to add um not really I think that's exactly the argument um we cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8781" display="02:26:21" %}} - escape from the spirit of God wherever we go his presence is there so that that is essentially saying that the spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8792" display="02:26:32" %}} - God I mean it's not saying it explicitly but it's right there you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8800" display="02:26:40" %}} - y all right good deal um this one somewhat clear right I mean that's still a couple hops in logic to get there but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8808" display="02:26:48" %}} - once you understand that immeasurability and omnipresence are unique characteristics of God as in God is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8814" display="02:26:54" %}} - only being to possess those then that's how you get there um so that's these two now we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8822" display="02:27:02" %}} - get to one of the ones that I think is dead clear um you really really have to do explaining away if you try to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8829" display="02:27:09" %}} - the spirit not God In this passage and this is in Acts chapter 5 uh with ananas and saf withholding some of the sale of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8837" display="02:27:17" %}} - their land now this passage uh I won't get on a super big side tangent here but uh people sometimes interpret this one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8845" display="02:27:25" %}} - wrong so this idea that um basically if we don't give all our money to the church then God's going to strike us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8852" display="02:27:32" %}} - down dead is not quite the point of the passage um the point is lying to God uh deception uh basically and specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8862" display="02:27:42" %}} - to cement the apostles Authority and this is one of the things that makes this passage kind of tricky to interpret  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8868" display="02:27:48" %}} - uh from what we might call a hermeneutic point of view is like what are we to get out of this how are we supposed to apply  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8874" display="02:27:54" %}} - to our own lives that sort of thing is that the apostles were given a good deal more Authority even than Pastor teachers  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8880" display="02:28:00" %}} - today and they did signs and uh God empowered them to cast out spirits and things like this um and here in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8889" display="02:28:09" %}} - context this is tied up in that to a degree so we see a little bit further on in the passage that the people are given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8896" display="02:28:16" %}} - to fear on account of this um so ananas and his wife struck down on account of deceiving um or attempting to deceive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8906" display="02:28:26" %}} - rather the apostles and as we see here um because fundamentally it is an affront to God himself um but doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8915" display="02:28:35" %}} - quite apply in the same way today so we're going to kind of leave all that aside of just a little bit of background  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8919" display="02:28:39" %}} - on this passage right so I'm going to go ahead and read this this is Acts 5: 3 to 4 says uh but Peter said in IAS why has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8927" display="02:28:47" %}} - Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land while it remained  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8933" display="02:28:53" %}} - unsold did it not remain your own and after it was sold was it not under your control why is it that you have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8941" display="02:29:01" %}} - conceived this deed in your heart you have not lied to men but to God so in verse three we have lying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8950" display="02:29:10" %}} - the Holy Spirit and then in verse four Peter said that you lied to God slam dunk right there is very little way that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8959" display="02:29:19" %}} - you can interpret this without going to Great contortions to somehow say that you know that Peter is saying that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8966" display="02:29:26" %}} - Anan Li to two separate people here um the by far the clearest way to interpret this text is that Anan eyes lying to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8974" display="02:29:34" %}} - Holy Spirit dwelling within him and that the subject or sorry the person being lied to in verse three and verse four is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8981" display="02:29:41" %}} - the same and that the holy spirit is god um questions on how that fits fits together or aie do you have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8988" display="02:29:48" %}} - more to say for this one no not nothing to say on this one right like I said in my opinion this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="8996" display="02:29:56" %}} - one of those ones that is this is one of the slam dunk ones this is the one where even if people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9003" display="02:30:03" %}} - don't buy the other ones maybe you can't get out of this um this is very very clear yeah all right Acts chapter 5  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9013" display="02:30:13" %}} - verses three to four um this one is a little bit a little bit less clear in my opinion this is another one where we we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9019" display="02:30:19" %}} - have some work to do here um so this is 1 Corinthians chapter 12 um now well it opens up in not a very pretty view here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9029" display="02:30:29" %}} - let me this is logos um Bible study software um so uh picking up at verse 11 we are talking about the distribution of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9038" display="02:30:38" %}} - spiritual gifts within the body so 1 Corinthians 12 uh one of the primary passages in the Bible talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9047" display="02:30:47" %}} - analogy of the church as one body and uh you know Ephesians 4 mentions gifts distributed to different people in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9055" display="02:30:55" %}} - church but Ephesians 12 also heavily hits that uh Verses 4 through six actually hit all three members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9063" display="02:31:03" %}} - Trinity I'm not sure if we actually went over this bit but it's another one of those places where all three show up and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9069" display="02:31:09" %}} - Audi and I previously made the argument that once you start seeing the threes all over the New Testament the the only  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9077" display="02:31:17" %}} - good way to explain it is that the three members are God that they are the Trinity you know this is why we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9084" display="02:31:24" %}} - continue to argue all all during our discussion here that the Trinity is is in the Bible we don't have to rely on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9091" display="02:31:31" %}} - church councils or later people to uh somehow say that we didn't understand intell then or whatever because uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9098" display="02:31:38" %}} - scripture itself obviously speaks of this Doctrine um so Verses 4 through six talk about how there's a variety gifts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9106" display="02:31:46" %}} - but the Same Spirit variety of Ministries and the same Lord and a variety of effects but the same God who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9111" display="02:31:51" %}} - works all things and all persons so we take God there to be the father um so once we hop down you know in the context  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9118" display="02:31:58" %}} - of this passage um you know I'll just read actually picking up at verse 7 just so we get the context right before verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9125" display="02:32:05" %}} - 11 so it says but to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good so we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9131" display="02:32:11" %}} - spiritual gifts here for to one is given the word of wisdom through the spirit and two another the word of knowledge  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9137" display="02:32:17" %}} - according to the same spirit and to another Faith by The Same Spirit and to another Gifts of healing by the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9142" display="02:32:22" %}} - spirit and to another the effecting of Miracles into another prophecy and to another the distinguishing of spirits to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9149" display="02:32:29" %}} - another various kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues now some of these spiritual gifts that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9155" display="02:32:35" %}} - we just went through those verses 7 through 10 uh were what we would call the transitional gifts During the period  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9163" display="02:32:43" %}} - of Acts uh this is what ichus teaches that during that time before the close of the Canon and before widespread  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9170" display="02:32:50" %}} - copies of scripture were available uh certain gifts prophecy tongues and the interpretation of tongues were used sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9178" display="02:32:58" %}} - of in an overtly Supernatural way to communicate God's truth in the absence of the closed Cannon or the availability  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9184" display="02:33:04" %}} - of the closed Cannon um okay so leaving that aside that's when we get to our verse here that Dr  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9191" display="02:33:11" %}} - lugan Bill's reference verse 11 which says but one in the same Spirit works all these things Distributing to each  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9198" display="02:33:18" %}} - one individually just as he Wills um so I am not exactly in Dr lug Bill's head um you know it took me a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9207" display="02:33:27" %}} - to try to figure out why is he using this verse to support uh you know the spirit's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9212" display="02:33:32" %}} - Divinity here um I think one of the clearer things is that um the spirit has agency here um and I know we've talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9222" display="02:33:42" %}} - about uh the spirit sort of being the impersonal member of of the Trinity the one who is in the background empowering  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9230" display="02:33:50" %}} - things but he's the direct subject in the sentence as in um he has a verb coming I'm trying to think about the way  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9240" display="02:34:00" %}} - that doesn't sound super grammatical here um like like he's the agent you know he's doing something here actively  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9246" display="02:34:06" %}} - um and uh a do you do you have thoughts um you know I I don't want to sound unconvincing but this was one of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9252" display="02:34:12" %}} - verses where I mean I think the entire passage in context supports the Trinity but on this one supporting the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9260" display="02:34:20" %}} - being God directly I was kind of curious why Dr luganville pick first 11 um oh okay um I think you just if if you take  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9270" display="02:34:30" %}} - the whole thing together you know it makes sense that um 11 would be would stand out the way that it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9278" display="02:34:38" %}} - does the we have we have um where does it talk about the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9287" display="02:34:47" %}} - Yes varieties of effects the same God varieties of Ministries same Lord Rises of gifts Same Spirit this is this is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9300" display="02:35:00" %}} - it's like a how do how do we express it it's more like these three are are of a Kind they're of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9308" display="02:35:08" %}} - class if if there are no varieties of gifts there will be no Ministries and there will be no effects so the this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9316" display="02:35:16" %}} - a connection of equals and then in verse 11 one and the Same Spirit works all these things Distributing to each one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9324" display="02:35:24" %}} - individually just as he himself Wills that's the sort of language that you would actually apply to God you know so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9331" display="02:35:31" %}} - I think I would actually look at it a bit more obliquely instead of um thinking in terms of these passages  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9338" display="02:35:38" %}} - support the the Trinity it would be more like this pass these passages essentially you know they they they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9346" display="02:35:46" %}} - assume the Trinity that's essentially the point but because um is is the spirit you know Distributing to each one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9356" display="02:35:56" %}} - individually as God Wills as the father Wills as you know as basically he is not doing so on his own authority as God but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9367" display="02:36:07" %}} - he does it on his authority as God he distributes to each one exactly as he pleases it's it's not as if he needs to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9374" display="02:36:14" %}} - be told who to give what so he distributes the gifts according to his own will that's a very significant  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9382" display="02:36:22" %}} - statement to make about the spirit of God you know so for those who struggle with um I I don't think it needs to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9390" display="02:36:30" %}} - exactly clinical you know to speak to what we're saying the Bible just assumes it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9398" display="02:36:38" %}} - does not actually you know profer um what would I call it it doesn't profer an explicit teaching of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9406" display="02:36:46" %}} - the Trinity just as it does a lot of things it's more like well here it is it's it's just it's just something it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9413" display="02:36:53" %}} - assumes and and presents in so many different ways that it essentially says don't you see it I mean it's kind of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9420" display="02:37:00" %}} - point I mean don't you see it it's it frames the entire thing it's trying to say or it is saying it's it doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9429" display="02:37:09" %}} - focus on it as a thing so um yeah that's what I would say about this verse 11 I think it's actually a pretty it's a it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9439" display="02:37:19" %}} - a it's each one that that we mention is even even when it seems to be a bit uh obscure is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9449" display="02:37:29" %}} - actually by itself so enough because how would you say that the one and the Same Spirit works all these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9458" display="02:37:38" %}} - things and it distributes to each one individually as he Wills I mean we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9466" display="02:37:46" %}} - um what God is looking to accomplish in the church and the spirit is acting on his own will you know that's a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9472" display="02:37:52" %}} - significant thing to say so you know I guess you know how we had one of the other ones basically obliquely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9479" display="02:37:59" %}} - referencing omnipresence right yeah you remember I I made the argument when we were talking about omniscience uh when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9487" display="02:38:07" %}} - it comes to molinism and this idea of how does God know best before things have happened that requires for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9493" display="02:38:13" %}} - knowledge and omniscience I I suppose you could you could say that this verse is very much getting at omniscience  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9500" display="02:38:20" %}} - right how could the spirit possibly know what gifts to distribute perfectly according to God's plan if he was not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9507" display="02:38:27" %}} - God um I I don't know necessarily if that's exactly what Dr lug and kind but you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9515" display="02:38:35" %}} - know you can get there you know as you say um it if the spirit is not God what does this verse mean that is a fair  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9524" display="02:38:44" %}} - question yeah you know I mean I I I really and you know that's one of the things where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9530" display="02:38:50" %}} - um we are not necessarily teaching this Doctrine from the perspective of what I might call an apologetic fashion um as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9538" display="02:38:58" %}} - in if I were talking to a skeptical crowd and I was like and they want me to show a verse where like it's logically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9546" display="02:39:06" %}} - inescapable that the spirit is God I would lead with Acts chapter 5 that passage because in that particular one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9552" display="02:39:12" %}} - it's like I said it's more of a slam dunk Passage in this particular one it's it's more evidence right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9559" display="02:39:19" %}} - because the most clear straightforward way to interpret this is that the spirit is God because he's taking this action  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9566" display="02:39:26" %}} - in this way which would have to perfectly align with the plan of the other members of the Trinity for it to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9571" display="02:39:31" %}} - make any sense and that just if he's not God why does it happen like this right suppose you could make an argument that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9579" display="02:39:39" %}} - he was just doing as he commanded but then why does it say as he Wills rather than as the father Wills for example you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9585" display="02:39:45" %}} - know I mean you can get there it's just you know yeah I I get it I get it I suppose  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9592" display="02:39:52" %}} - I just um I I don't particularly uh uh you know frame it with respect  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9600" display="02:40:00" %}} - to um people who want to see it literally stated it's it's more like we much as we are looking at each passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9609" display="02:40:09" %}} - in isolation in the end we're really looking at the Bible as a whole so each passage is part of you know the context  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9616" display="02:40:16" %}} - it's part of the um whole thing so it's essentially saying look here it's mentioned again here is it's imp passing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9623" display="02:40:23" %}} - you know it may not be in your face or or explicit as you might expect but all of these passages only make sense when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9632" display="02:40:32" %}} - you assume the Trinity once you don't assume the Trinity meaning is lost the thing does not make sense anymore so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9642" display="02:40:42" %}} - what would it mean if you say that the spirit one one and and the same spirit is is is giving these gifts and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9651" display="02:40:51" %}} - distributing them entirely as he pleases as he himself Wills what does that mean for those who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9660" display="02:41:00" %}} - say oh to make sense of the spirit of God you have to think of him as a force well what force is willing anything what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9667" display="02:41:07" %}} - force is having a pleasing a a sense of this pleases me this is what I would like to do that an impersonal Force have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9675" display="02:41:15" %}} - that sort of thing okay so let's not talk about an impersonal Force this is the spirit of the father well you still  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9682" display="02:41:22" %}} - have have to deal with the context of this particular statement one and the Same Spirit Works in all of these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9687" display="02:41:27" %}} - well yeah that's like saying um uh Aima um there are there are varieties of gifts but the same Aima and there are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9700" display="02:41:40" %}} - varieties of Ministries but the same here noi basically it's the same person is referencing just using different  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9707" display="02:41:47" %}} - words for emphasis okay great let's work with that then when when you make these arguments and you put in the rest of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9716" display="02:41:56" %}} - of of of the statements from the scriptures does it make sense no you find yourself still having to deal with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9724" display="02:42:04" %}} - things that don't fit together but once you just when you've taken all of these things together you you you come down to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9733" display="02:42:13" %}} - there are three persons here and one of them is the spirit you it's just a natural Fallout of the reading y I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9742" display="02:42:22" %}} - specifically this passage uh you know we'll get to the other thing uh soon enough talking about how there are three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9748" display="02:42:28" %}} - distinct persons in the Trinity right we are not Mists as Christians we don't believe there's one God with three modes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9754" display="02:42:34" %}} - or aspects this is a good passage for that actually because the passage makes no sense interpretation wise if you say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9761" display="02:42:41" %}} - it's all just the same being right um yeah well you know sufficient there too is our discussion I think um one more of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9771" display="02:42:51" %}} - what I would call the slam dunk references that we're going to go through here um this involves a passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9776" display="02:42:56" %}} - from the Old Testament being quoted in the New Testament and you'll see why this is important in its reference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9785" display="02:43:05" %}} - so this is Hebrews chapter 3 so the writer of Hebrews says therefore just as the holy spirit says today if you hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9793" display="02:43:13" %}} - his voice do not Harden your hearts as when they provoked me in the day of trial in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9797" display="02:43:17" %}} - wilderness uh and then so on talking about the hardness of Hearts of the generation that wandered in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9804" display="02:43:24" %}} - wilderness for 40 years so this is Hebrews chapter 3: 7 through 11 says therefore just as the holy spirit says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9810" display="02:43:30" %}} - and then this is quoting Psalm chapter 95 and uh you know verse seven in Psalm  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9818" display="02:43:38" %}} - chapter 95 says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you would  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9824" display="02:43:44" %}} - hear his voice his being uh definite having the antecedent of God here um do not Harden your hearts as in marah as in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9833" display="02:43:53" %}} - the day of mass in the wilderness so here his voice is said to be God and then when Paul quotes it or the writer  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9840" display="02:44:00" %}} - of Hebrews if you don't take HEB to be Paul um says that the holy spirit says this the holy spirit is directly equated  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9848" display="02:44:08" %}} - with god um because it's directly quoting uh this Psalm here like the wording that you see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9855" display="02:44:15" %}} - here is like it it is I mean so Hebrews the book of Hebrews is written in Greek um Psalm 95 would have been written in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9863" display="02:44:23" %}} - Hebrew whether it's a direct quote from the seant or whether the writer of Hebrews paraphrased from the Hebrew  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9869" display="02:44:29" %}} - directly um either way I actually don't know off the top of my head for this one which one it is um but either way this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9876" display="02:44:36" %}} - is a very clear quotation of Psalm 95 and so that's where we get the direct equivalence made between uh God's voice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9884" display="02:44:44" %}} - here uh in verse 7 of Psalm 95 and the Holy Spirit being the one speaking in verse chapter 7 of Hebrews chapter 3 or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9894" display="02:44:54" %}} - sorry verse seven of Hebrews chapter 3 so uh this is actually one of my favorite passages for defending the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9903" display="02:45:03" %}} - Trinity whenever I've had to engage with uh atheists and others about the Trinity I would always say especially those who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9912" display="02:45:12" %}} - insist that the holy spirit is not a person and like well makesense you know right Mak sense of this and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9921" display="02:45:21" %}} - again we we are not even close to exhausting all the references and scriptures to the persons of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9929" display="02:45:29" %}} - and you know all the all basically all the references that have anything to do with with the Trinity these are just a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9937" display="02:45:37" %}} - sampling and some of them are really a very strong obvious sampling we if we correlate um Hebrews 3 with Psalm 95 we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9947" display="02:45:47" %}} - can I think Psalm 97 sorry which one is it it's Psalm 95 here yeah that's Psalm 95 yeah so um if we if we were to put  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9959" display="02:45:59" %}} - them side by side we can see oh at least Paul takes uh the the the psalm to be referring to the Holy Spirit but you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9970" display="02:46:10" %}} - know then you have people who have absolutely no respect for the Bible saying well Paul might have been wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9977" display="02:46:17" %}} - there or we know that Hebrews has this problem or that problem so we can't admit it as evidence or you know they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9984" display="02:46:24" %}} - come up with all sorts of excuses for rejecting that um bottom line is in so far as you accept Hebrews as part of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="9992" display="02:46:32" %}} - Bible you have to accept that the holy spirit is speaking with the authority of God and he's speaking as a person there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10001" display="02:46:41" %}} - so but then I what I found um really first of all I don't like making I'm not interested really in persuading people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10010" display="02:46:50" %}} - about what the scriptures teach and what they don't teach I want to lay out exactly what I've seen in the Bible and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10016" display="02:46:56" %}} - each person can make their decisions as say please but I've seen that when when I had to deal with arguments that were  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10026" display="02:47:06" %}} - about for example the um personality that that is that that the holy spirit is a person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10035" display="02:47:15" %}} - when I've had to deal with that okay no when I've had to deal with the argument that the Holy Spirit and Jesus are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10042" display="02:47:22" %}} - separate persons from the father it has been very very tough because if you were to present this passage to such a person  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10049" display="02:47:29" %}} - they would be like sure it's still the father speaking we're not saying that the spirit does not speak we're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10054" display="02:47:34" %}} - that the father and the spirit are the same so of course the spirit can't speak well that that makes no difference you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10059" display="02:47:39" %}} - know so those who are models so to speak wouldn't have any problems dealing with these passages the spirit is speaking oh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10068" display="02:47:48" %}} - sure the spirit speaks so what we're not saying he doesn't speak we're just saying that he's the father was saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10074" display="02:47:54" %}} - he's the same as as the son and I've actually argued with someone I've debated someone who actually said look  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10082" display="02:48:02" %}} - that when Jesus went into the water and Rose up out of the water it was himself speaking from Heaven to himself and also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10093" display="02:48:13" %}} - a lighting from heaven upon himself it was like how can you make this how does it work in your head all of this stuff  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10103" display="02:48:23" %}} - you can put it together in one mind and it works for you but that's exactly how people can get when it comes to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10111" display="02:48:31" %}} - truth we have we can't we can't underestimate people's um capacity to reject the truth and to make up their  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10119" display="02:48:39" %}} - own excuse their own um uh contortions and and Replacements and substitutions for the truth so what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10129" display="02:48:49" %}} - can say definitively without any doubt is that the Bible presents the Holy Spirit here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10134" display="02:48:54" %}} - as speaking and as having a will of his own because he is reacting in a way that I mean a lot of people who like to think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10141" display="02:49:01" %}} - of the Holy Spirit as retiring and shy and all of that would be pretty shocked when they actually see that what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10147" display="02:49:07" %}} - being said in Hebrews 3 is that he was angry with his generation and swore that they would never enter his into his rest  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10154" display="02:49:14" %}} - some something that seems to fit more um with the personality of the father than you would expect of the Holy Spirit and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10162" display="02:49:22" %}} - yet this is the holy spirit of whom it is being spoken so um yeah everything we see here speaks to what we have seen in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10173" display="02:49:33" %}} - the Bible that there are three persons and one of them is the holy spirit that's that's it yep well uh sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10182" display="02:49:42" %}} - interesting aside here we know from Hebrews chapter four actually that the rest of God you know the continuous  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10187" display="02:49:47" %}} - Sabbath rest we actually enter that through the indwelling Holy Spirit now that we are all indwelt by the spirit in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10193" display="02:49:53" %}} - the New Testament I'm not so far I'm not so sure I would go so far as to say that that is explicitly in view but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10200" display="02:50:00" %}} - it does come right after Hebrews chapter 3 so interesting side note there um when he talks about my rest holy spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10208" display="02:50:08" %}} - the gatekeeper of that because it is through the spirit that we in the modern day um indwelt by the spirit re go into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10217" display="02:50:17" %}} - that continual Sabbath rest of God that Hebrews chapter 4 talks about um so fun fact um so I'll leave these verses up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10225" display="02:50:25" %}} - we'll come back to them um as we go through uh the next uh the next study which will be that there are three  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10234" display="02:50:34" %}} - persons in the Trinity but this was the last passage that we had here for um supporting that the idea that the holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10243" display="02:50:43" %}} - spirit is God I'm actually we have a verse from 2 Corinthians up on the slide as well 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10250" display="02:50:50" %}} - Lord is the spirit and where the Lord's spirit is there is freedom um uh interesting that the Lord is the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10257" display="02:50:57" %}} - so modus would be cool with that but then the way it's worded is that we have you know uh the Lord being possessive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10265" display="02:51:05" %}} - here um so be probably genitive in Greek um before spirit so the Lord is the spirit and where the Lord's spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10273" display="02:51:13" %}} - is makes no sense unless they're both God right um so all these verses as we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10281" display="02:51:21" %}} - saying is not completely representative of literally all the references to the trinity in the Bible you know we've gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10287" display="02:51:27" %}} - across quite a few here with respect to the father and the son and the spirit um but the point is the Bible all over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10295" display="02:51:35" %}} - place supports this notion that the members of the Trinity are God um so uh a you have anything else else to say on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10305" display="02:51:45" %}} - the spirit specifically uh before we close out this lesson uh no I think I think it's it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10312" display="02:51:52" %}} - it's quite enough so far yeah okay good deal so now that we have finished discussing the spirit we have gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10323" display="02:52:03" %}} - through all three members of the Trinity talking through many verses supporting each so in this lesson we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10331" display="02:52:11" %}} - talking about how all three me members of the Trinity are deity so God is one in essence but that does not mean that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4l_OzkCbJxg" time="10340" display="02:52:20" %}} - only one person of the Trinity is deity or is divine or is God and so we've talked about how the father is God the

### Summary {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-distinct-persons-summary}

This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is only one person (merely displaying three modes or aspects of Himself).

God is three in person, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are distinct persons rather than manifestations of a single, multifaceted person.

Heresies of the past which have challenged the distinct personalities of members of the Trinity include modalism (the idea that Christ and the Spirit are mere "modes" of the Father's personality), and docetism (the notion that Christ only seemed real and was in reality merely a phantom of sorts representing the Father's plan). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons.

{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1" display="00:01" %}} - all right guys so in the next lesson of our study of the Trinity here going through Bible basics part one theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="9" display="00:09" %}} - we are going to be talking about how all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons so in terms of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="17" display="00:17" %}} - essential points we're going to be going over we're going to be introducing this General Point uh talking about how even  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="23" display="00:23" %}} - though God is one in essence it does not mean that the Trinity is only one person merely displaying three modes or aspects  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="31" display="00:31" %}} - of himself um and so that is the point that we are making here um and if you recall we had discussed how the practice  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="39" display="00:39" %}} - that we are going through right now is kind of talking about what the Trinity is in terms of what it is not and so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="46" display="00:46" %}} - this particular aspect um or this particular point in that uh sort of way of thinking about things that we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="54" display="00:54" %}} - organizing our study with uh is basically making the point that God is not just one one being God is three  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="61" display="01:01" %}} - distinct well I gotta be very careful how I say this God is one in essence so he is one being that's what one in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="66" display="01:06" %}} - essence mean but he has three persons um God is not one person um so if you recall the general definition of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="75" display="01:15" %}} - Trinity that we argue for is three in person one in essence or one in essence three in person and this is defending  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="82" display="01:22" %}} - the three in person part and so uh we don't have quite as many verses this time as we did in uh the last section  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="88" display="01:28" %}} - going over all three MERS of the Trinity being God we just kind of have a one for most of these points here but we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="96" display="01:36" %}} - going to be talking about how the father is a unique person is own right for he's distinct from the son the son's unique  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="102" display="01:42" %}} - person's own right for he's distinct from the father and the Holy Spirit is a unique person in his own right because  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="108" display="01:48" %}} - he acts as a distinct person so these are the points that we're going to be going over as we establish uh The Wider  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="114" display="01:54" %}} - point that just because God is one in essence does not mean that the Trinity is only one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="123" display="02:03" %}} - person so when we say that God is one in essence but not one in person um kind of what we're getting at here is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="134" display="02:14" %}} - God uh sorry is that all three members of the Trinity are distinct rather than all being manifestations of a single  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="142" display="02:22" %}} - multifaceted person so um typically in theology um you'll hear this referred to as modalism the idea that the son or the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="152" display="02:32" %}} - spirit are somehow just modes of God um so uh that believe is is down here right here modalism um there's another one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="162" display="02:42" %}} - docetism the notion that Christ only seemed real and was sort of a phantom of sorts representing the father's plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="169" display="02:49" %}} - probably not not quite as common um something that you might come up against in terms of the Trinity it is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="176" display="02:56" %}} - historical heresy relating to uh this particular point that we are making here but by far most common challenge to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="184" display="03:04" %}} - proper understanding of the Trinity is this idea of modalism that Christ and the spirit are just modes of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="189" display="03:09" %}} - father's personality rather than being separate persons in their own right um and just to take a step back and talk a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="196" display="03:16" %}} - little bit about why do we even have to do this it's because it's really hard to think about how United the three members  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="204" display="03:24" %}} - of the Trinity are without getting the notion that they're one person and the reason for that is because for as humans  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="210" display="03:30" %}} - if you take three people and you stick them together and even if they agree on so many things they do not have the sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="219" display="03:39" %}} - of unity that the Trinity has um the Bible's very clear about that human beings we don't share an Essence we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="225" display="03:45" %}} - not one in the same being even people like identical twins right um so the scientist would say that they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="232" display="03:52" %}} - identical genetic code yet it's very obvious to us as humans that they are not the same they don't have the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="239" display="03:59" %}} - way will if you will um so they don't have the same human spirit is what we would say um they are separate beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="246" display="04:06" %}} - very obviously separate beings because they choose different things um they do not have that Unity of will that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="254" display="04:14" %}} - said is having and so why we kind of have to spend some breath arguing this point that we're making here is because  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="260" display="04:20" %}} - God is described as having one Essence being perfectly United in will and yet not just being one person and so we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="269" display="04:29" %}} - to spend some time on that not one person thing because for us as humans we don't have a good analog in the human  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="275" display="04:35" %}} - world for this because anytime you have multiple persons you do not have the unity of will that God has said to have  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="281" display="04:41" %}} - and so it's why it's just kind of hard for us to kind of metabolize and why it's worth spending some time talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="287" display="04:47" %}} - about it's not just because there were some people in the past who didn't believe this and and you were trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="293" display="04:53" %}} - lead everyone away in heresy or whatever it's it's not as if this is just a historical thing that we're kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="298" display="04:58" %}} - covering because gwiz some people in the past were wrong it's because it is actually difficult for us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="304" display="05:04" %}} - conceptualize in our head properly what it means for God to be three in person but yet have that Unity uh uh unity in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="312" display="05:12" %}} - action that the Trinity manifests so this is the topic that we're going to be covering here Audie do you have initial  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="320" display="05:20" %}} - thoughts on this point that we're going to be making here before we jump right into establishing it for each member of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="326" display="05:26" %}} - the Trinity not really I think we can okay great so picking up we are going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="337" display="05:37" %}} - talking about how scripture is very clear that the father is a unique person in his own right because he's distinct  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="344" display="05:44" %}} - from the son so I did kind of mention how we don't have as many passages um given as support here for the last point  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="351" display="05:51" %}} - that doesn't mean that these are any less certain uh truths that we ought to believe it's just just we don't we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="358" display="05:58" %}} - haven't listed as many here here um so the passage that we are going to be using here to support the notion that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="363" display="06:03" %}} - the father is unique in his own right because he's distinct from the son is this passage from Daniel chapter 7 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="370" display="06:10" %}} - 13 so I'll go ahead and read this and then we'll talk about it a bit so Daniel 7113 says I was looking during my vision  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="377" display="06:17" %}} - of that night and behold with the Clouds Of Heaven one like a son of man was coming up and he approached the Ancient  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="384" display="06:24" %}} - of Days that is the father and they brought him before him well first him is Son of Man second hym is the Ancient of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="393" display="06:33" %}} - Days so why are we using this to establish that the father is separate from the son is because the son of man I  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="402" display="06:42" %}} - mean I suppose you have to do some interpretation to get there um now Daniel is one of those eological texts  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="408" display="06:48" %}} - this is this is specifically prophetic here um but the son of man is Jesus Christ um when you interpret it when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="416" display="06:56" %}} - interpret it correctly that's definitely who the son of man is um so the son of man is Jesus Christ the son in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="422" display="07:02" %}} - Trinity and the Ancient of Days when you interpret it correctly um again I suppose you have to do some L work to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="428" display="07:08" %}} - get there but the Ancient of Days is very clearly the father um and so how can the son come before the father if  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="437" display="07:17" %}} - the son is the father it just makes no sense to say that um this doesn't stop people from saying it but they're just  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="444" display="07:24" %}} - wrong is the thing um because no matter how they try to explain this it always ends up getting all twisted and messed  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="451" display="07:31" %}} - up because it just doesn't fit with what the text is saying how can you have one being who comes before himself in two  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="459" display="07:39" %}} - separate forms it just that's not how that's not how we say a being has that Unity right  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="468" display="07:48" %}} - um so how is one being split in actually two separate beings uh you know like for example when we face when we Face  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="476" display="07:56" %}} - ourselves in the mirror we understand that's just the reflection of light we aren't actually two separate beings but  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="481" display="08:01" %}} - what you would have to argue that God is one person it has two separate aspects of himself here is that there are one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="491" display="08:11" %}} - being kind of manifesting in two ways at the same time which is kind of the very definition of what we would call  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="498" display="08:18" %}} - different persons right um so uh I don't know maybe I'm not doing a very job in terms of like philosophical jargon  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="506" display="08:26" %}} - saying the right things in like a formal flow of logic but that's the idea here that's why we say the son cannot be the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="514" display="08:34" %}} - father because it just doesn't make sense given what this passage says aie would you like to add any points to what  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="520" display="08:40" %}} - I've started with um Can can you hear me yeah I can hear you can you all hear me yeah I can hear you can you hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="530" display="08:50" %}} - us okay um so uh I don't I don't I don't think there is much to say actually in the previous discussion we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="541" display="09:01" %}} - were having I think um many of those passages actually present this same discussion uh father being unique in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="550" display="09:10" %}} - own right being distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit um that's actually how we know  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="558" display="09:18" %}} - because as you read through the Bible you keep seeing these things that don't make sense when you think of God as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="565" display="09:25" %}} - single as a single person in his personhood you know some things that are said of him wouldn't uh line up then um  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="576" display="09:36" %}} - so that we see that the father uh is demonstrated to be a person um by himself that makes sense the passage in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="586" display="09:46" %}} - Daniel 713 um may not be very popular among Believers but it's um there are many things in that Gem of a story  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="596" display="09:56" %}} - including how the Leake of fire is formed formed and all of that stuff but critically there was one who was like a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="604" display="10:04" %}} - son of man who was brought to this Ancient of Days we know that the son of man being spoken of there was the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="610" display="10:10" %}} - Jesus himself and um the the ancient of these is is presented as being separate from this son of man so yeah it there  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="623" display="10:23" %}} - are other passages too in the Bible that that lead us to these um appreciations that um the father is a unique person  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="632" display="10:32" %}} - separate from the other two members of the um Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="638" display="10:38" %}} - yeah all right well that's where we'll do as I say just a single passage here for each member so this is the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="646" display="10:46" %}} - being distinct from the son um next we're going to talk about how son is distinct from the Father which you kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="651" display="10:51" %}} - of get from this one we'll look at another passage in just a moment so just as we talked about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="661" display="11:01" %}} - the father's distin from the son well kind of it goes both ways but we're going to look at another passage here  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="667" display="11:07" %}} - also on this particular uh Point saying that the son is unique person for he distinct from the father so uh for this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="675" display="11:15" %}} - we're going to look at Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 um it says behold I have arrived in the scroll of your book it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="682" display="11:22" %}} - written about me to do your will oh my god um so and we open up more of the surrounding in context here in Hebrews  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="690" display="11:30" %}} - chapter 10 uh Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 is where we are uh so the person speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="697" display="11:37" %}} - here is Christ because that's what verse 5 in Hebrews chapter 10 says so I'll actually go ahead and read this whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="701" display="11:41" %}} - passage it says uh chapter uh chapter 10 verse 5 therefore when Christ came into the world he said sacrifice and offering  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="708" display="11:48" %}} - you did not desire but a body you prepared for me with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased then  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="715" display="11:55" %}} - I so I being Christ said then I said here I am it is written about me in the scroll I have come to do your will my  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="724" display="12:04" %}} - God so how would we say it makes sense for  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="731" display="12:11" %}} - Christ because Christ is the one Speaking here um to speak about so actually interestingly this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="740" display="12:20" %}} - NIV um in the translation here which I suppose comes from ichus we have a y  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="749" display="12:29" %}} - it might be pronoun there I could go check the Greek I suppose but basically either way I'm sorry that was just me  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="756" display="12:36" %}} - getting curious um the point being is that it's very clear that Christ is saying that he came into the world from  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="762" display="12:42" %}} - the father's will right the will of another we would say um although of course there's one you know the unity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="769" display="12:49" %}} - the members of the Trinity means that when things happen they all will it because of that Unity but um this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="775" display="12:55" %}} - another passage supporting that idea that the personhood of the members of the Trinity sort of is just essential to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="784" display="13:04" %}} - make the passages make sense because as soon as you start trying to argue that Jesus Christ is simply an aspect of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="792" display="13:12" %}} - father what does this passage in Hebrews chapter 10 even mean if you believe that um and uh you know more to the point if  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - we were supposed to understand it that way a lot of parts of the Bible just become really impenetrable um so so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="809" display="13:29" %}} - there is a sort of uh risk we would say to trying to apply aam's razor to interpretation large because there are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - some points of biblical truth that are very complicated um so I'm going to use as a smear word here this is not a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="825" display="13:45" %}} - positive term I'm going to say that things that seem really esoteric or mystical as in all people throughout  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="832" display="13:52" %}} - history have like misinterpreted this passage and only I have the correct interpretation when people say that sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="838" display="13:58" %}} - of thing especially if it bounds into something that we would sort of call mysticism or this idea of very special  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="846" display="14:06" %}} - knowledge this this new way of looking at something and yet no matter how much you press them they can't like formulate  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="852" display="14:12" %}} - it in terms of propositions it's always sort of vague and hard to understand and and impenetrable is a good word yeah you  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="860" display="14:20" %}} - shouldn't believe that sort of thing right and here the point I'm making is that trying to interpret this passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="866" display="14:26" %}} - trying to interpret the passage that we had just read um in the previous section talking about Daniel chapter 7 trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="874" display="14:34" %}} - interpret these passages with the father and the son being literally the same person it just doesn't make sense um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="882" display="14:42" %}} - people like I said they may try to talk circles around you and explain thus and so and and you know basically and not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="890" display="14:50" %}} - that I have had very many serious debates uh among Christians or you know people at least claiming Christ about  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="896" display="14:56" %}} - this because to be perfectly honest nowadays there aren't that many Mists I mean they're out there AI has has said  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - that he's actually had serious conversations about it before but what I'm trying to boil this down to is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="908" display="15:08" %}} - when you try to interpret these passages while making them the same person it just makes everything so complicated and  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="917" display="15:17" %}} - so not straightforward so that everything requires explanation that it is just obviously not the right  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="922" display="15:22" %}} - interpretation um so uh hopefully that's not too handwavy um I think this is quite clear just how I think Daniel  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - chapter 7 is quite clear um aie do you have further thoughts on this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="937" display="15:37" %}} - [Music] um not quite I think that this passage um always appealed to me  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="945" display="15:45" %}} - because of um how uh in uh the reference the the part of the law that this was taken from um we have a different  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="957" display="15:57" %}} - rendering there yeah instead of um uh okay it was from the PS actually in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="965" display="16:05" %}} - the sum it said that my did it say a body you had prepared for me my ears you have pierced that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - what it said and uh when you when you look at the part of the law that it was referencing it says that a servant who  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="982" display="16:22" %}} - says that he does not want to leave you no he he is very happy to be part of your family and he wants to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="991" display="16:31" %}} - remain so for the rest of his days um you're supposed to pierce his ear uh with an all um and that would be uh like  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1001" display="16:41" %}} - a way to tell anyone who sees him that he belongs to a particular house even though he's not related to that house by  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1008" display="16:48" %}} - Blood maybe something of that sort so um what we see is this uh a body you have prepared for me that used to stump me a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1017" display="16:57" %}} - bit but then when you relate these two ideas it really comes down to um you get um this body that I have is meant to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1028" display="17:08" %}} - used in service to you so like this person opted for Lifetime slavery this Jew who had his ear pierced  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1041" display="17:21" %}} - um here the Lord Jesus is is expressing the same thing which of course I think should be rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1051" display="17:31" %}} - obvious as to uh how it it says that um he is not the father that he's a separate person from the father I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - there are still those who do believe that since it is God anything is possible so he can um be a sleeve to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1066" display="17:46" %}} - himself but then yeah I I don't see how that fits yeah I I will say I don't know why I I must have missed it or something  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1074" display="17:54" %}} - because the slide obviously says your will right I I must have just misspoken earlier  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1080" display="18:00" %}} - because this has your too and I checked the Greek this is the second person pronoun here your um it makes the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1087" display="18:07" %}} - argument real straightforward because the will that Christ discusses In this passage here is not his right it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1096" display="18:16" %}} - my will it's your will right second person it literally you know how we have persons in grammar it is using a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1104" display="18:24" %}} - separate person in grammar um hence more than one person in the Trinity right um yeah you know like it it's it's really  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1112" display="18:32" %}} - that simple um because if Christ can speak of the father's will as being not my will not his own  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1122" display="18:42" %}} - will they simply cannot be the same person um it's it's I I don't know what I was getting at earli I must have just  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1130" display="18:50" %}} - like been looking at something that was wrong but it is the second person pronoun which makes that argument real  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1136" display="18:56" %}} - straightforward um yeah yeah all right now as we've said before um just as in the other section these are not the only  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1144" display="19:04" %}} - passages we could pull to support these things we're just kind of making the points as we go along here so this was  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1150" display="19:10" %}} - establishing that the son is distinct person from the father right we've done that um so we did that in Daniel chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1157" display="19:17" %}} - 7 we were I guess kind of coming at it from the perspective of the father Hebrews chapter 10 coming that from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1162" display="19:22" %}} - perspective of the sun next we will be talking about the spirit and the spirit's distinct personhood  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1172" display="19:32" %}} - so now we're going to talk about how the holy spirit is a unique person is well in his own right for he acts as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1179" display="19:39" %}} - distinct person so the passage this time again we got one verse per these points here uh just in this part of the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1187" display="19:47" %}} - passage this time Romans chapter 8 verse 26 um says the spirit helps us in our weakness in a similar way for we do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1195" display="19:55" %}} - know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself self intercedes for us also with anguish supplications with  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1201" display="20:01" %}} - which words cannot express right um so passage this actually comes right before the uh uh for knowledge you know like  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1209" display="20:09" %}} - the end of Romans chapter 8 I think it's like verses 29- 31 talk about you know like uh God's for knowledge and calling  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1217" display="20:17" %}} - justifying glorifying that that passage but talking about how the spirit prays for us he intercedes for us and when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1225" display="20:25" %}} - pray you know we we pray to the father in the name of Jesus Christ I could go find verses to support that what I just  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1231" display="20:31" %}} - said um but when we pray we pray to God um addressed to the Father the spirit is interceding for us how can the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1242" display="20:42" %}} - intercede to the father shall we say if the spirit is the father you see what I'm saying like it  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1250" display="20:50" %}} - again this is one of those situations where you start trying to argue for a modalist position and it just doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1257" display="20:57" %}} - make sense because you ask someone what does that mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1262" display="21:02" %}} - precisely like basically redu you ad absurdum is what we would call it in terms of logic if you say that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1269" display="21:09" %}} - spirit is the father and the father is the spirit and that there is you know one God and one God means one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - person what does this verse mean then if you interpret it that way and you will just never get a satisfying answer out  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - of someone if you press them on that because there isn't a satisfying answer like they can go through all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1290" display="21:30" %}} - gymnastics as I've been arguing and you know um you know it might have been good if I went and actually tried to find an  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1296" display="21:36" %}} - argument here so that it wasn't just me saying oh some people actually say this but you know like I had a representative  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1302" display="21:42" %}} - argument from one of them but the point that I have been making and uh maybe maybe it sounds like I'm straw Manning  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1308" display="21:48" %}} - here but the point is if people try to do that presumably they have some way to say that this verse doesn't mess up  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1315" display="21:55" %}} - their interpretation but no matter what they say it's going to be overly long and complicated and just obviously not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1321" display="22:01" %}} - right is the point now uh because again uh I feel like the spirit is one of those that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1329" display="22:09" %}} - sometimes it's perhaps the one that we struggle the most with um when we talk about aspects of the Trinity um I pulled  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1336" display="22:16" %}} - up this verse this is one that we talked about um at the very beginning of the last lesson as well when we were talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1341" display="22:21" %}} - about how all three members of the Trinity are God here um so this is when Jesus is asking the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - uh for the holy spirit so he's telling the people in John chapter 14 uh verse 16 so I will ask the father and he will  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1356" display="22:36" %}} - give you another Advocate to help you and be with you forever that Advocates the spirit Jesus is asking the father to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1364" display="22:44" %}} - give another person I feel like if there's one verse in the Bible that makes clear that there are three persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1372" display="22:52" %}} - in the Trinity it' be this verse right um for the reasons that we been saying before right if if there's one person in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1382" display="23:02" %}} - the Trinity what in the world would this verse even mean then yeah one person I am asking myself to send myself how does  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1391" display="23:11" %}} - that make sense right yeah um yeah of course uh as we said there are those who would essentially say that because he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1400" display="23:20" %}} - God we won't understand one mysteries of God and all of that stuff it doesn't have to make sense to us but um like we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1410" display="23:30" %}} - said this this is not something we see in isolation the rest of the Bible speaks to it but this is a demonstration  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1417" display="23:37" %}} - of the um uh personhood of the of the spirit as a separate thing from the personhood of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1424" display="23:44" %}} - the father and the personhood of the spirit of of the son sorry so he essentially says just as we we we the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1433" display="23:53" %}} - Bible tells us that that he intercedes that is he prays for us he prays on our behalf he makes requests on our behalf  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1442" display="24:02" %}} - to who to himself just as Paul as Stephen pointed out that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1451" display="24:11" %}} - is insane to think that he would be making requests to himself but some people are fine with uh Insanity when it  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1460" display="24:20" %}} - comes to God because they believe that because he's God nothing makes sense with him and everything is acceptable of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1468" display="24:28" %}} - everything makes sense no matter how ridiculous it is but this is the Bible's one of the Bible's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1474" display="24:34" %}} - demonstrations of uh the personhood of the spirit as a separate thing from the personhood of the other persons of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1480" display="24:40" %}} - Trinity yeah yeah I mean I would say not to get off on too big a tangent but we are right to hold philosophy at arms  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1489" display="24:49" %}} - length a bit I know we talked about this in some of the the first lessons in this series here in in bb1 theology uh making  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1497" display="24:57" %}} - the point when people split hairs about nature and Essence and what essential characteristics are and things like that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1502" display="25:02" %}} - right would God be God if he wasn't ex right or you know what I'm talking about like that sort of thing where  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1510" display="25:10" %}} - philosophers they they they make certain boxes about things and I'm not trying to bash philosophers here right um uh or  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1518" display="25:18" %}} - philosophy large as a practice of being Analytical in how we think about the world and things like this but we as  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1524" display="25:24" %}} - Christians we submit to the Bible not to the Wom of professional secular philosophers and there is something to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1533" display="25:33" %}} - be said for not swinging too far the other way which is submitting to what we would call a mystical understanding  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1540" display="25:40" %}} - where you know for lack of a better word God's elogical but we just say well that's just that's fine you know because  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1547" display="25:47" %}} - we can't understand him um this is the whole you know I'm trying to think about the right way to say this you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1554" display="25:54" %}} - perhaps uh certain very well educated atheists might might think that Christians are kind of dumb right they  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1560" display="26:00" %}} - are anti-education they can't talk intelligently about topics because they just say oh have faith and then they  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1567" display="26:07" %}} - never even articulate their own positions um I am not trying to bash our brothers and sisters here because the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1574" display="26:14" %}} - Bible says we are we ought to have childlike Faith right for lack of a better way of putting it childlike faith  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1581" display="26:21" %}} - is not dissertations in analytic philosophy right um you see what I'm saying um yeah so we don't need to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1588" display="26:28" %}} - ashamed of being like well the Bible says so so there um you know however where I'm going with this is that this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1598" display="26:38" %}} - idea that we have to believe nonsense because that's what it is right fundamentally what we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1604" display="26:44" %}} - here where these people say that the spirit intercedes to himself it's just nonsensical on the face of it it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1609" display="26:49" %}} - a contradiction on the face of it right um yeah so we ought to have childlike faith in the Bible but we don't turn off  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1617" display="26:57" %}} - our brains to believe whatever someone says the Bible says um you know you know Audi and I have had a conversation quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1626" display="27:06" %}} - recently actually I'm talking about in interpretation when we talk about we need to take the Bible at its word right  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1633" display="27:13" %}} - and we need to be reasonable um uh you know I I won't pull in the whole context of that P other  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1639" display="27:19" %}} - discussion but basically when we interpret the Bible we have to interpret it reasonably and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1646" display="27:26" %}} - point here is that how just how other people get offended when you take their words out of context and you try to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1653" display="27:33" %}} - their words mean something that they obviously don't mean well we need to stake down our flag and call people out  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1659" display="27:39" %}} - when they do that to the Bible too right because there are certain lines that we just can't cross when it comes here and  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1667" display="27:47" %}} - saying somehow that the spirit interceding to himself because the spirit is is the father and the father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1674" display="27:54" %}} - the spirit it's one of those lines where when when people start going there I mean like you got to stick down  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1682" display="28:02" %}} - a flag somewhere right and like I said God does not submit us he God does not have us believe nonsense um despite that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1689" display="28:09" %}} - being a strawman argument that atheists might use against Christians is that I don't know we don't think things through  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1695" display="28:15" %}} - maybe we don't hold intellectually rigorous positions their straw man in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1699" display="28:19" %}} - Christianity is what's happening there um yeah yeah all right so um perhaps more we could about um holy spirit's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1709" display="28:29" %}} - distinctness as well so we talked about Romans 826 we pulled up this verse in John chapter 14 as well talking about uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1716" display="28:36" %}} - Jesus Christ uh you know asking the father to send the spirit and how honestly this verse kind of hits all  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1722" display="28:42" %}} - three of them right is that the only way in which this verse makes any sort of sense is if all three of them are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1727" display="28:47" %}} - persons um because otherwise you have you know the son who is the father asking the father for to send the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - right if you view them all in terms of one person it just what does that even mean right it doesn't make sense it  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1741" display="29:01" %}} - contradicts itself on the face of it it's why that interpretation is unworkable um  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - so that's probably where we'll wrap our discussion here of the idea that the spirit is well is a unique person in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1756" display="29:16" %}} - own right for he acts distinctly right he intercedes for us before God when we pray which wouldn't make any sense if he  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1765" display="29:25" %}} - wasn't a distinct person so as promised this lesson a little bit shorter here not going to go belver too  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1777" display="29:37" %}} - much of what we talked about uh but just in review we have talked about how all three members of the Trinity are their  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1785" display="29:45" %}} - own unique persons so even though God is one in essence that's this main point we're talking about here God is one in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1791" display="29:51" %}} - essence that does not mean that the Trinity is only one person but it has as three persons and we've talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1799" display="29:59" %}} - these passages that just on the face of it clearly support this idea that even though God has this Unity of will this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - single Essence um he cannot be the same person because then how could the son of man approach the Ancient of Days as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1816" display="30:16" %}} - separate person how could um Jesus Christ in Hebrews chapter 10 be talking about the father's will right um how uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1826" display="30:26" %}} - things about Christ were written in your will um and how could the Holy Spirit here be interceding for us when we pray  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1834" display="30:34" %}} - if the holy spirit is the exact same person as the father for example um so those were some of the passages we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1840" display="30:40" %}} - brought in to support this topic but the general overarching idea and as we said this is not meant to be completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1847" display="30:47" %}} - exhaustive um you know I guess I should also mention this verse that we talked about in John Chapter 14 verse 16  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1852" display="30:52" %}} - another one where the son asks the father for the spirit to be sent all of these all of these things point to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1859" display="30:59" %}} - clear conclusion that even though God is one in essence God is not one in person um and so that's where we'll wrap this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1868" display="31:08" %}} - and uh in future lessons we will be examining a couple more of these uh of these statements about what the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1875" display="31:15" %}} - is not so that once we finish it all we will have that clear understanding of exactly what the Trinity is
