### Summary {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be kicking off our new study of BB1: Theology on Ichthys by starting to discuss the Essence of God. We'll talk about how God is being (Exodus 3:14-15), as well as exactly what essence means as a concept.

#### The essence of God is being. He is the Great I AM {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-essence-of-god-is-being-he-is-the-great-i-am}

{{< /subjects >}}

The essence of something is what it really is. "Essence" and "being" are precise synonyms.

God tells us who He is in Exodus 3:14-15.

If you've ever thought about the question "Well, if the universe exists because God made it, then why does God exist? Did something or someone likewise make God?" then the answer is no---God exists simply because God *is* being.

Unbelievers scoff at that logic, but it is what the Bible says.

<!-- --- -->

#### The resplendence of God: light and glory {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-the-resplendence-of-god-light-and-glory}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-resplendence-unapproachable-light">God > Resplendence > Unapproachable light</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#god-resplendence-glory">God > Resplendence > Glory</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Loosely speaking, light captures the sense that God is sublime and unapproachable (compare squinting at the sun, being blinded by it), while glory represents the side that shines forth visibly to mankind.

God's glory is most directly revealed to mankind through His Son, Jesus Christ. As Hebrews 1:1-3 makes clear.

<!-- --- -->

##### Q: 1 Timothy 6:16 talks about God's unapproachable light. It also says God alone possess immortality. What does that latter statement mean? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-1-timothy-6-16-talks-about-god-s-unapproachable-light-it-also-says-god-alone-possess-immortality-what-does-that-latter-statement-mean}

When 1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God possess immortality, what about the fact that both humans and angels have eternal existence?

Is it that God *owns* immortality, but that he gives it to us creatures such that we too now possess it (some to eternal life, and some to eternal death, based upon that which we choose)? Is this another aspect of God's Uniqueness?

<!-- --- -->

##### Q: We say God dwells in this unapproachable light that no one has seen nor ever can see. What then of cases in scripture where people seem to have "seen God?" {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-q-we-say-god-dwells-in-this-unapproachable-light-that-no-one-has-seen-nor-ever-can-see-what-then-of-cases-in-scripture-where-people-seem-to-have-seen-god}

Did Moses not see this light upon Mount Sinai? What about the Apostles present on the mount of transfiguration? What about Paul on the road to Damascus? What about John in His visions of God, recorded in Revelation?

The visible form of this glory was veiled in Christ's first advent to make the choice for Him genuine. The glory was, however, revealed in His words and works.

Compare: "Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess." That is not now, but eventually.

<!-- --- -->

#### Essence, nature, character... ??? {#introduction-the-essence-of-god-essence-nature-character}

{{< /subjects >}}

If you've ever been confused about what the difference between nature and essence is (and we may as well throw form and substance in the mix as well), you are in good company. Philosophers have been arguing about these things for a very long time (compare Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and others).

Arguments usually seem to hinge on how "inherent" something is to an object. For example, a triangle must have three sides, otherwise it is no longer a triangle. Things that are "essential" (compare the word essence!) are things without which the object is not whatever we are saying it is.

Compare this link: https://chrismlegg.com/2018/06/19/what-do-essence-and-nature-mean-a-simple-explanation/

<!-- --- -->

So, on our topic, must God be infinite and perfect in character to be God? Are these essential characteristics of God?

It is my opinion that wandering too far in this direction rapidly leads one to theosophy (in the negative sense). God *is* infinite and perfect in character. So what were we arguing about again?

If someone were to whine that I am question-dodging and not defining terms, I would say that God's nature deals with His infinite abilities, God's character deals with His moral perfection, and both are fundamental parts of who He is as God.

#### Introduction: God's infinite nature {#god-s-infinite-nature-introduction-god-s-infinite-nature}

Key point: God's nature is infinite. *Infinite*.

God's infinity – infinity in every way and according to any conceivable true standard – is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His abilities*.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Spiritual {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-spiritual}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-spiritual">God > Is spiritual</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#angels-are-subject-to-matter">Angels > Are subject to matter</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's being transcends the physical universe. He is not limited or bounded by material issues or concerns. God is not subject to matter in any way. God is not made of matter – God created matter and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

##### If mankind is at present "a little lower than the angels", why do angels desire physical bodies like ours? {#god-s-infinite-nature-if-mankind-is-at-present-a-little-lower-than-the-angels-why-do-angels-desire-physical-bodies-like-ours}

Compare Hebrews 2:6-8.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Eternal {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-eternal}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-eternal">God > Is eternal</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's being transcends time. He is not limited or bounded by temporal issues or concerns. God is not subject to time in any way. God is not constrained by time – God created time and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

##### Angels are subject to time {#god-s-infinite-nature-angels-are-subject-to-time}

Were prophets actually transported into the future (i.e., plucked from one point in the "river of time" and dropped at another as an observer), or did they just have visions of the future (i.e., see visions of it like a movie)?

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Immeasurable (in a spatial sense) {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-immeasurable-in-a-spatial-sense}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-immeasurable">God > Is immeasurable</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's being transcends space. He is not limited or bounded by spatial issues or concerns. God is not subject to space in any way. God is not confined by space – God created space and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Unique {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-unique}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-unique">God > Is unique</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-de-facto-ruler-of-the-universe">God > Is *de facto* ruler of the universe</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Uniqueness comes from God's infinite nature. No one else in the universe can reasonably be compared to Him. He is absolutely unique within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His spirituality, eternity and immeasurability. From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence.

<!-- --- -->

| Essential Quality                               | Manifesting in creation as                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being spiritual (rather than bound by matter)   | Omnipotence (God may affect material creation however he pleases)                                                     |
| Being eternal (rather than bound by time)       | Omniscience (God knows everything in creation from beginning to end, and even what could have been)                   |
| Being immeasurable (rather than bound by space) | Omnipresence (God is ever-present in creation: as far as the East is from the West, nothing can separate us from God) |

While we may not be properly able to fully grasp God's true nature since we are small, finite beings bound by spacetime, it should nonetheless be clearly apparent that it is not possible for any created creature to compare with the Creator. Even creatures far more powerful than ourselves---Satan and the other angels---are bound and limited in ways God is not, leaving God completely alone and unique in His transcendence of and supremacy within the physical universe.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Omnipotent {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omnipotent}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omnipotent">God > Is omnipotent</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is all-powerful, irrespective of matter. He can effect anything He desires in the material realm, and nothing can transpire apart from His will. Therefore there is no deed (nor was there ever, nor will there ever be) which God is unable to do, small or great.

<!-- --- -->

##### "Could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" {#god-s-infinite-nature-could-god-create-a-rock-so-big-even-he-couldn-t-lift-it}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#apologetics">Apologetics</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

You may have come across something like "So, could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" This is (supposedly) pitting two aspects of omnipotence against each other: God's ability to create anything He wishes *ex nihilo*, and God's strength.

People argue that the two superlatives mandated by omnipotence contradict each other. Supposedly, if God cannot create an object too heavy for Him to lift, he is not omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to create anything. And likewise, if there would exist some object that God could create but was unable to lift, then He also would not be omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to lift everything. "See!", they say, "either way, He cannot do something; therefore, He is not omnipotent!"

We can let people who wish to not believe on account such an argument go on their merry way. We needn't take them up on the debate. For it is *obvious* that God can both create whatsoever He wishes, and also manipulate His creation in whatever ways He wishes. The idea of a material object He cannot create is definitionally impossible, and so too a material object He cannot manipulate. Put differently, there is no such thing as an object He could create but not lift, or an object He could lift but not create. So the entire objection is circular by assuming such a thing can exist to begin with. That is, they've already put God in a box from the very beginning, and then only proceed to smugly knock down nothing but a straw man.

<!-- --- -->

My counsel would be to avoid all such nonsense. God can do "it", whatever "it" may be. Always. We follow אֵל שַׁדַּי, *El Shaddai*, God Almighty, He who was, and is, and is to come---He who holds the strings of the universe in His hands, and can create or annihilate galaxies in the blink of an eye. And we'd better fear that power and majesty as we ought, to keep our lives in perspective. We are tiny compared to the vastness of the Earth, much less our solar system, much less our galaxy, much less the universe. But God is even bigger (infinitely bigger), and could snuff them all out in the blink of an eye if He decided to. *That* is the kind of power in view when we speak of God being omnipotent. Not that He will actually snuff out the universe on a whim, but that it would be nothing for Him to do so, since He is in complete control of matter, time, and space... and things only exist because *He* causes them to exist.

#### God is Omniscient {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omniscient}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omniscient">God > Is omniscient</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is all-knowing, irrespective of time. He can effect anything He desires in the temporal realm. Therefore God knows (has always known, and always will know) everything, the end from the beginning. As the Everlasting One (Ps.90:2; 90:4), His knowledge of every event that ever has or will or even could occur within His creation is comprehensive and absolute.

<!-- --- -->

##### God's knowledge of hypotheticals {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-s-knowledge-of-hypotheticals}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#omniscience-includes-knowledge-of-hypotheticals">Omniscience > includes knowledge of hypotheticals</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#molinism">Molinism</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#middle-knowledge">Middle knowledge</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

The "could occur" bit is important. God's knowledge of all possible hypotheticals is sometimes discussed in terms of so-called ["Molinism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism) and "middle knowledge". I prefer to discuss it independent from all the baggage there, however.

Here's an example: since the Bible says that God will never test us past what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), then that implies He knows what we would and would not be able to bear. He wouldn't be able to perfectly test us to refine our faith unless He knew all information like this.

Same deal with perfectly disciplining us, and plenty of other matters besides. Put simply, God's perfect foreordination of all things logically requires that He know everything about all potential paths in the mind-bogglingly complex decision tree that spans the history of the entire universe. It has always puzzled me why people would ever think to argue against such a notion, but alas, some people do for some reason. Perhaps it is because such a belief requires one to appreciate how truly "big" and unlike us (with our very finite perspective) God really is?

<!-- --- -->

For now, you should mostly ignore the fact that some people have again put God in a box in their minds, and content yourself with the sure confidence that God knows everything---absolutely everything, inclusive of our free-will decisions before we even make them---and is so infinitely wise as to have perfectly mapped out all of creature history before the universe was even created. There is a Perfect Divine Plan being worked out around us, and God knows very well what He is doing, rest assured.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Omnipresent {#god-s-infinite-nature-god-is-omnipresent}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omnipresent">God > Is omnipresent</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is ever-present, irrespective of space. He can effect anything He desires in the spatial realm (Job 26:7). Therefore God has the ability (has always had, and always will have) to be anywhere and everywhere, local and universal.

Of particular note is that this means God sees all. Nobody can sneak anything past God, and on that Great Day of Days, all will be revealed. It also means it is completely futile to try to run away from God. Like Jonah, we will find that no matter where we go, God and His purposes for us will always be there too.

#### Introduction: God's perfect character {#god-s-perfect-character-introduction-god-s-perfect-character}

God is perfect in His character, irreproachable and blameless in every possible way.

{{% nt t="ESV" h="300px" p="Matthew 5:48" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 5:48 | NIV11" %}}
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

{{% scripture-l p="Matthew 5:48 | NIrV" %}}
So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /nt %}}

When firmly grasped, God's perfection---perfection in every way and according to any conceivable true standard---is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His motives*. God's perfect character will never be less than the highest, the best, and the purest that the human mind can comprehend.

As in Genesis 6:9---if you'd like, here's an [interlinear](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/gen/6/1/t_concif_6009) for the verse.

#### God is Good {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-good}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-good">God > Is good</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is good (Hebrew *tov*: טוב); it is the antithesis of evil. So how does goodness respond to sinful man? In His goodness, God always has our best interests at heart. Therefore His desire for us to be free from evil and devoted to good is genuine. Even though we are sinful and by nature unworthy of His blessing, in His goodness God has nevertheless found a *gracious* way to redeem us from sin without compromising His character, namely, by giving us the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Holy {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-holy}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-holy">God > Is holy</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is holy (Hebrew *qadosh*: קדוש); it is completely separate from evil. So how does holiness respond to sinful man? In His holiness, God can never compromise His perfect standards for any reason. Therefore His commitment to condemning evil and rewarding good is inviolable. But even though we are sinful and by nature deserving of His judgment, in His holiness God has nevertheless found a *merciful* way to justify us in spite of our sin without violating His character, namely, by judging His Son, Jesus Christ in our place.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Faithful and True {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-faithful-and-true}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-faithful-and-true">God > Is faithful and true</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is faithful and true (Hebrew: *omen*, *emeth*: אמת ,אמון); it is actively opposed to evil. So how do truth and faithfulness respond to sinful man? In His faithfulness and truth, God is entirely reliable and trustworthy in all that He promises to us and does for us. Therefore His veracity and dependability in offering us a way through Jesus Christ to escape the evil of death and embrace the good of eternal life are beyond reproach. So even though we are sinful and by nature objects of His wrath, in His faithfulness and truth God has nevertheless found a way to make *peace* between Himself and us and to remove the enmity between Himself and us, caused by our sins, without corrupting His character, namely, by reconciling us to Himself through the death of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

#### God is Sovereign {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-sovereign}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-sovereign">God > Is sovereign</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-de-jure-ruler-of-the-universe">God > Is *de jure* ruler of the universe</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Sovereignty comes from God's perfect character. No one else has a legitimate right to rule over the universe. He is the absolute sovereign within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due. Sovereignty thus speaks to God's *moral authority* and *right* to order the universe however He chooses.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His goodness, holiness and truth (essential qualities independent of His creation). From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His love, justice, and life (qualities applying to His creation which correspond to goodness, holiness and truth).

Only God is qualified to be the ultimate judge of the morally accountable creatures He has created, and thus to hold them responsible for their actions. As *de facto* ruler of the universe (through His infinite nature) and *de jure* ruler of the universe (through His perfect character):

##### Summary: God's sovereignty in action {#god-s-perfect-character-summary-god-s-sovereignty-in-action}

| Goodness          | Love                       | Paying for sin                    | Grace                               | Redemption     |

In this---God's full plan for saving sinful man---absolutely everything relies upon the cross, the blood of Jesus Christ. One particularly memorable way I have heard it described is that "God's Mercy and Justice intersect in the cross."

#### God is Love {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-love}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-love">God > Is love</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Having love for His creatures, is a natural consequence of God's goodness. Out of the intrinsic goodness of His character, God loves us with a perfect love, desiring to help us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His holiness and justice in the process and forgive our sin without consequence (as evil suggests He should). Therefore God had to find a way to *reach out to us in love* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Grace* is the biblical name for God's policy of lovingly redeeming us from our sins through Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's gracious offer of love and redemption by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

Demanding justice for His creatures is a natural consequence of God's holiness. Out of the intrinsic holiness of His character, God must deal with us in perfect justice, righteously condemning us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His goodness and love in the process and abandon us to our sins (as evil suggests He will). For God found a way to *treat us as righteous* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Mercy* is the biblical name for God's policy of justly forgiving us on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's merciful offer of justification by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

##### "How is it just for unbelievers to face infinite, eternal punishment for finite sins?" {#god-s-perfect-character-how-is-it-just-for-unbelievers-to-face-infinite-eternal-punishment-for-finite-sins}

This question's wording presupposes something that is simply not true: that unbelievers face eternal punishment in hell for sins they commit in this life.

As we go over in the video, hell exists *not* to punish unbelievers for their sins---as if they could somehow pay for or atone for them---but only because of unbelief ("blasphemy against the Holy Spirit"). That hell is not punishment for sins but the consequence of unbelief---of wanting to spend eternity apart from God---is a rather fundamental point about the nature of hell, but is nonetheless widely misunderstood.

Jesus paid for *all* human sin upon the cross, and, moreover, imperfect human beings are not even worthy sacrifices. That is, we could not pay for our sin even if we wanted to; we are not qualified since we are tainted and marred by sin. Only Christ---the true, blameless Lamb of God---can take away the sins of the world with His blood, and He already did so upon the cross some 2,000 years ago.

If God punished unbelievers for their sins in hell after Christ already took the judgement for said sins, the sins would be judged twice ("double jeopardy")---obviously incompatible with justice. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that falsely believing that human beings are punished for their sins in hell is no less than a rejection of the efficacy of Jesus' payment for all human sin upon the cross (or perhaps the Father's acceptance of Jesus' work). If you believe in unlimited atonement and penal substitutionary atonement (both true things that are clearly taught in scripture), then the purpose (*telos*) of hell cannot be the punishment of human sins. It is simply theologically unworkable.

**To pull us back to the present question:**

The grace of the cross is positively scandalous:  
&emsp;That God would judge His own Son for human sin,  
&emsp;Even for the most gross and reprehensible sins of humanity.

That unbelievers refuse to accept Christ's payment for them is tragic:  
&emsp;That God's love will go unreciprocated,  
&emsp;Despite Him laying down His life for their salvation.

But that unbelievers accuse God of injustice is ironic:  
&emsp;That they scorn the God that loves them so much,  
&emsp;Who has already saved them from their punishment,  
&emsp;By taking it upon His own shoulders.

When unbelievers say it is not just for them to face infinite, eternal punishment for finite sins, they miss the fact that God *already judged Jesus for all their sins upon the cross*, and that people in hell are not there to punish them for their sins, but because they chose unbelief and separation from God. God has, out of His unfathomable grace, spared them the true consequences of their sins---Jesus bore these consequences instead, even for the most vile and unrepentant of unbelievers. Nevertheless, He will let all those creatures who choose of their own will to live apart from Him to have their wish. And an eternity apart from God---Who is everything good---will be utterly miserable.

The point is that hell is not miserable on account of punishment for sins committed, but miserable on account of separation from God.

{{% sidenote %}}
All of this should make it clear why the idea of "levels of hell" (cf. the ["Nine Circles of Hell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29#Nine_circles_of_Hell) in [Dante's *Inferno*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29)) is so problematic theologically.

Because all people in hell are there for the same reason (unbelief)---not to punish them for their sins---there can be no levels of hell.

That people find this unpalatable ("What do you mean Hitler will be no worse off in hell than my 'nice' unbelieving neighbor?!") does not make it any less true. As I have said before, the cross is truly scandalous grace---and what is even more scandalous is that God gives a real offer of salvation to every single human being who has ever lived... even those who---in our opinion---actually deserve a healthy dose of eternal suffering (e.g., those who rape and murder children). *That* is how far God has gone in offering a genuine choice to all mankind.

For people who still balk at this teaching (viewing it as too lenient upon the truly evil), consider Paul. If God made Paul (who---prior to his conversion in Acts 9---was a fierce persecutor of the Early Church) the Apostle to the Gentiles, then when you find fault with God for showing grace to sinners who you think are too evil, are you saying God made a mistake with Paul?

#### God is Life {#god-s-perfect-character-god-is-life}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-life">God > Is life</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Saving the lives of His creatures is a natural consequence of God's truth and faithfulness. Out of the intrinsic veracity and trustworthiness of His character, God honors His gracious and merciful promise to restore us to Himself and thereby to eternal life, delivering us from the condemnation of death accruing to us in our sinful state. In doing so, however, He has not failed to resolve the competing demands of His goodness and love on the one hand, with those of His holiness and justice on the other (as evil suggests He must). For God has found a way in accordance with His character to *eliminate the wall of sin and consequent wrath which separates us from Him*, and has done so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf (He died that we might have life). *Peace* is the biblical name for God's life-giving policy of reconciling us to Himself on the basis of the work of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's offer of life, peace, and reconciliation by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

God's holiness overflows in justice, offering mercy to sinful Man:

### Summary {#introduction-the-trinity-summary}

In this lesson, we are going to be starting an examination of a new topic in our study of God: the Trinity. God existing in three persons yet with one shared essence is about as core a concept as any we have in Christianity, which is one of the reasons that heresies related to the Trinity have been among the most existential of all threats to truth in the Church. This being the case, it is very important for us to understand the ins and outs of this keystone doctrine, so that we may stand firm in the truth of the Bible and its teaching.

#### The core definition of the Trinity: God is One in Essence, Three in Person {#introduction-the-trinity-the-core-definition-of-the-trinity-god-is-one-in-essence-three-in-person}

We will examine exactly what this statement means as we continue in our study, but suffice it to say that this idea of "one essence / three persons" (or "three persons / one essence" if you prefer that order to the phrasing instead) is the central point, and what you should always keep in mind when thinking about the Trinity. These two statements together sum up all that is important about the triune nature of God.

{{< /subjects >}}

In short, no. The Trinity has always been there in the Bible, for those willing to open their eyes and ears to the truth. How later people came to label the idea is in no way related to the fact that this concept has been there in scripture from day one.

{{% ichthys-translation p="Revelation 4:8" %}}
Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord, God, the Almighty  
He who was, and He who is,  
and He who is coming.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

No specific term for the triune nature of God occurs in the Bible. The inspired writers of the New Testament clearly felt that the existence of one God in three distinct persons, the doctrine which we now call "the Trinity", was a relatively straight-forward concept and accessible enough (even with a cursory reading of the scripture) from passages such as the one quoted above.

<!-- --- -->

{{% technical-discussion %}}
To flesh out a bit more why we might make the claim that Revelation 4:8 supports the doctrine of the Trinity, consider:

- The threefold repetition of the adjective Holy (Greek: [ἅγιος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g40/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *hagios*)
- The three titles used: κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ.
  - [κύριος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2962/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *kurios*, means "Lord"
  - [θεός](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *theos*, means "God"
  - [παντοκράτωρ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3841/esv/mgnt/0-1/), *pantokrater*, means "the almighty". It is a compound noun formed from the combination of [πᾶς](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3956/esv/mgnt/0-1/) and [κράτος](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2904/esv/mgnt/0-1/).
- The three aspects of God's eternal existence: He who was (ὁ ἦν), and He who is (ὁ ὢν), and He who is to come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος). The first two are, respectively, the imperfect active and present active participles of [εἰμί](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1510/esv/mgnt/0-1/) (Greek's "to be" verb), and the third is a present middle participle, from [ἔρχομαι](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2064/esv/mgnt/0-1/).

Perhaps someone might say that it is not impossible or even particularly uncommon for multiple adjectives and titles to be applied to the same person. Fair enough. But one might also point out this verse's structure of threefold repetition of threes would be somewhat odd unless it were intentional, right? That is, why is it that we have three groups of threes (three Holy's, three titles, and three aspects of God's eternality) rather than some other structure like one/four (two non-three groups), or two/one/three/one (four groups, only one of which is a group of three), and so on?

The explanation that makes the most sense is simply that John, inspired by the Holy Spirit, put things this way intentionally. And therefore it ought not be ignored. QED.
{{% /technical-discussion %}}

<!-- --- -->

The Apostolic Fathers, the generation that followed the men who actually penned the New Testament, also felt that merely quoting scriptures was an entirely adequate way of discussing the relationship between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Not until the late second and early third centuries did the term "Trinity" itself come into general use as a way of defending (against a variety of heresies which sought to deny various aspects of the unique triune nature of God) what earlier generations of Christians had taken completely for granted based upon their common-sense approach to reading the Bible: that God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all God, and that at the same time they are---in what we may call a "personal" way---also distinct from each other.

God is one. God is also three. And there is no contradiction between these statements.

<!-- --- -->

#### Spelling it out a bit more {#introduction-the-trinity-spelling-it-out-a-bit-more}

As we have said, the core definition of the Trinity is that God is one *in essence*, and three *in person*.

To put the doctrine in complete terms, the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God; yet at the same time the Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit, the Son is not the Father or the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son.

In this lesson we kick off a series of discussions we will be having about what the Trinity is *not*, to help throw into starker relief what it actually is. This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that only one person of the Trinity is deity.

#### Our next several discussions: understanding the Trinity in terms of what it is *not* {#all-members-of-the-trinity-are-deity-our-next-several-discussions-understanding-the-trinity-in-terms-of-what-it-is-not}

Last lesson we gave the basic definition of the Trinity: "three in person / one in essence" or "one in essence / three in person."

We can better understand what the Trinity is by first considering what it is *not* in terms of the definition given above, so that will be our focus for the next several discussions.

God is *three* in person, and all three persons of the Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) are divine. Heresies of the past which have challenged the divinity of members of the Trinity include adoptionism (asserting that Christ is the Son of God only in the sense of adoption), the Ebionite heresy (teaching that Christ had only a human nature empowered by God's Spirit), and Unitarianism (which asserts the uni-personality of God, denying the deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit).

But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are deity. Compare: Is.63:9-14; Matt. 3:16-17; 28:19; Jn.14:16-17; 1Cor.12:4-6; 2Cor.13:14; Eph.4:4-6; 1Pet.1:1-2; Rev.1:4-6.

God is three in person, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are distinct persons rather than manifestations of a single, multifaceted person.

Heresies of the past which have challenged the distinct personalities of members of the Trinity include modalism (the idea that Christ and the Spirit are mere "modes" of the Father's personality), and docetism (the notion that Christ only seemed real and was in reality merely a phantom of sorts representing the Father's plan). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons.

{{< /subjects >}}

In any human association, there is always inherent inferiority and disparity present---in practice, if not perhaps on paper. People are separate beings, and these are the simple consequences of that. However, this is not the case for God; the Trinity shares completely perfect unity and equality.

God is *one* in essence and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are coequal, coeternal, and con-substantial partners in one and the same essence. Heresies of the past which have challenged the coequality of members of the Trinity include subordinationism (which alternatively asserts that either Christ or the Spirit is by nature inferior to the Father) and Arianism (which teaches a Christ not entirely equal in divinity to the Father). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are coequal partakers of the same essence.

As seen from the equal rank accorded to each in the formula for profession of faith at the point of spiritual (*not* physical) baptism into the body of Christ:

God is *one* in essence, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are the sole, joint partakers of that same essence rather than three similar beings of similar essence. All so-called Christian sects which elevate saints and angels to the status of divinity essentially belong to this heretical category (after the manner of pagan pantheons, which also possess numerous "deities" of lesser and greater rank). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity alone share the same unique essence:

### Summary {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-bible-summary}

In this lesson, we go over how the Trinity can be a tricky concept to understand and explain, which makes it very important to keep our focus on the Bible when discussing it. Otherwise, we might otherwise end up off in the weeds, which is certainly not where we want to be in our understanding of this core doctrine of Christianity.

#### Review {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-bible-review}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-definition">Trinity > Definition</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

The definition of the Trinity which best does justice to the biblical statements on the subject is the one we have previously stated, namely, that *God is **one** in essence and **three** in person*. We get an even clearer picture of what the Bible has to say about the Trinity when we combine this traditional definition with the four corollaries we've just gone through:

- All three members of the Trinity are divine persons.
- All three members of the Trinity are unique persons.
- All three members of the Trinity have coequal and coeternal essence.
- All three members of the Trinity share the same divine essence.

<!-- --- -->

#### The Trinity can be hard to explain properly {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-bible-the-trinity-can-be-hard-to-explain-properly}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#limited-human-perspective-makes-some-teachings-hard-to-understand">Limited human perspective > Makes some teachings hard to understand</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

As can be seen from the numerous heresies (touched on some in our previous lessons) that have sprung up to challenge orthodox statements about the Trinity, the doctrine can be a difficult one to state in a proper, biblical way. This is especially true the further any definition of the Trinity moves away from actual statements contained in the Bible (which, as we have already stated, were felt to be sufficient by the Apostles and Apostolic Fathers).

It should be noted here that even the terms "essence" and "person" were felt by some theologians of the early church to be controversial. We may talk of Man's essence (we are all cut from the same spiritual cloth), and Man's personality (we are all unique individuals), but the essence of God is different from the essence of Man (for one thing, all members of the Trinity share *the same* divine essence), and the idea of personality in the Trinity is different from that of human persons (to take but one example, the absolute unity of agreement and purpose of the Trinity throughout all eternity is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively beyond human experience).

<!-- --- -->

<a href="/subject-index/#central-doctrines-to-the-christian-faith-satan-attacks-more-fiercely">Central doctrines to the Christian faith > Satan attacks more fiercely</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

The lesson here is that rationalistic speculation---always dangerous when expounding the Bible---is even more to be avoided in the case of the Trinity, a doctrine that was only fully revealed with the arrival of the New Testament. What God *has* chosen to reveal about this doctrine, He has revealed carefully and gradually. We will cover the subject of the Trinity in the Old Testament more fully in future lessons, but it may be said here that a large part of the reason for this guarded revelation of the doctrine (beyond our human limitations in comprehending it) may be the all too obvious fact (see our prior discussions) that *wrong* ideas about the nature of the Trinity have historically posed such a dire threat to the entire basis of our Christian faith.

Just a little leaven in the loaf, and Satan can make the Trinity seem as an association of "gods" (and so no different from paganism) or one "god" with three hats (thus completely eliminating the importance and efficacy of Christ's incarnation and sacrifice).

In His loving wisdom, God has told us what we most need to know without giving us either information that could be misinterpreted, or less than accurate illustrations that might do more harm than good.

### Summary {#illustrating-the-trinity-summary}

In this lesson we discuss illustrations that seek to help explain the Trinity. Since nothing in this created universe is truly like God, all of these illustrations are necessarily lacking in one way or another, and it is for this reason that we need to be quite wary of reading too much into them. If they help us better wrap our minds around the core teaching of the Trinity (namely, that God exists in three persons sharing one essence), then all to the good. However, we ought not ever build doctrine on top of things that are merely analogies, and analogies that are not even in scripture at that.

{{< /subjects >}}

As we discussed in our last lesson, attempting to illustrate such a carefully protected doctrine as the Trinity has the potential of doing more harm than good. The fundamental problem with illustrations of the type we will consider in a moment is that they all necessarily contain potentially dangerous and untrue points of comparison, which, if too much stress be placed upon them, run the real risk of leading to heretical conclusions, a danger that far outweighs any good they may do in attempting to shed some light on the subject.

The number one objection to such illustrations is that God is divine, and since nothing and no one else is, *any* illustration will needs be imperfect and inaccurate (a fact which may well explain why no such illustrations occur in the Bible: Is.40:18). And there is more. Historically, Satan's attacks on the doctrine of the Trinity – a teaching crucial to the integrity of our Christian faith – have focused on the three-fold sovereign *personality* of God and/or His *deity* in three persons. But this reality of divine, triune personality is precisely the point that all illustrations of the Trinity miss (of necessity, since there is nothing "like" the Trinity).

<!-- --- -->

#### An illustration from the early church: the Trinity "triangle" {#illustrating-the-trinity-an-illustration-from-the-early-church-the-trinity-triangle}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-illustrations-trinity-triangle">Trinity > Illustrations > Trinity triangle</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

This oldest of the Trinity illustrations is also in many ways the best, because the non-doctrinal point of comparison (i.e., the triangle) merely serves to organize visually the meaning imparted by the words: all three members of the Trinity are God ("*one in essence*"), yet they are distinct from each other ("*three in person*"):

![The Trinity Triangle](/longer-topical-studies/ichthys-bb1-the-study-of-god-group-study/illustrating-the-trinity/trinity-triangle.gif)

<!-- --- -->

#### The illustration of the family of Man {#illustrating-the-trinity-the-illustration-of-the-family-of-man}

Like the Trinity, mankind has multiple members, all possessed of similar, spiritual essences. But the Trinity *share* a unique, divine essence, and their triune unanimity of purpose is unlike anything in the realm of humanity.

<!-- --- -->

#### The illustration of the human mind {#illustrating-the-trinity-the-illustration-of-the-human-mind}

Like the Trinity, the mind can be said to be at once one thing, yet at the same time several things (intellect, emotion, conscience etc.) and can dialogue with itself, and even be at cross-purposes with itself. But the Trinity is composed of distinct, divine personalities to which the inner-workings of our psyches make a poor comparison.

<!-- --- -->

#### Illustrations from the world of nature {#illustrating-the-trinity-illustrations-from-the-world-of-nature}

There are many things in the natural world that consist of distinct, multiple parts that at the same time constitute one complete whole. For example, distinguishable branches, roots and trunk are all part of one and the same tree, and eggs have three distinct parts (yolk, white and shell) without any of which three you would no longer have an egg. None of the illustrations of this sort really help to explain the unique personalities of the Trinity or their shared divine essence.

<!-- --- -->

#### Illustrations from the physical realm {#illustrating-the-trinity-illustrations-from-the-physical-realm}

This category of illustration contains some of the more interesting examples that have been used to explain the Trinity, though all suffer from the same objections that were lodged against the former category:

- Light is one yet distinct (and cf. God "being light"---1 John 1:5): radio is heard, visible light is seen, and infrared is felt
- The universe is one yet distinct: time, space, and matter
- Time is one yet distinct: past, present, and future
- Space is one yet distinct: length, breadth, and height
- Matter is one yet distinct: energy, matter, phenomnea

<!-- --- -->

#### Conclusions: these illustrations are only the loosest of analogies at best {#illustrating-the-trinity-conclusions-these-illustrations-are-only-the-loosest-of-analogies-at-best}

The most that can be said for the best of these illustrations is that to the extent that they remind us of the awesome wisdom and power of God in creating these complex, wonderful things (often taken for granted), they may also help us to realize that the Maker is likely to be even more complex and wonderful, and so accept what we know to be true about the Trinity ("one in essence, three in person"), even if it seems too complex and wonderful to fully grasp.

As we have said, however, care must be taken to see that none of these illustrations is taken too far, lest by attempting to understand "beyond what is written" we be led instead to dangerous and extra-biblical rationalizations based on these loose analogies. For the Trinity is often a good "litmus test" for our Christian faith. To accept it, one must accept not only the existence of God, but the distinctiveness and divinity of Jesus Christ, the true touch-stone principle that divides believers from unbelievers (1Jn.2:22-23). By distorting our understanding of the Trinity, the devil ultimately seeks to destroy our faith in Jesus Christ, the real focal point and rationale for satanic attacks that seek to confuse the issue of "one in essence, three in person".

#### Roles of the Trinity in the Plan of God {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god}

A more valuable approach than the use of non-biblical illustrations to understand the nature of the Trinity is the examination of the function of the Trinity as described in the Bible. The scriptures have much to say about how God works in human history, and, specific to our topic, what roles the individual members of the Trinity play in that work, otherwise known as the "plan of God".

---

#### General Introduction: The Roles of the Trinity Are a Biblical Way To Get Additional Perspective {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-general-introduction-the-roles-of-the-trinity-are-a-biblical-way-to-get-additional-perspective}

God has not been operating in human history on an ad hoc or reactive basis, but has been "working everything together for good" (Rom.8:28) since the moment of creation. The Plan of God will be discussed as a topic in its own right in the [part 2B](https://ichthys.com/2B-Eschato.htm) of this series ([*Eschatology*](https://ichthys.com/2B-Eschato.htm)), but it will be helpful at this point to consider the unique roles played by the individual members of the Trinity in executing that plan in time, for by so doing, we shall gain *biblical* insight into the true nature of the Trinity.

No potentially-misleading illustrations necessary

#### The Names of the Trinity: Shared Names {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-the-names-of-the-trinity-shared-names}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-shared-names-elohim">Trinity > Shared names > *Elohim*</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-shared-names-yahweh">Trinity > Shared names > *Yahweh*</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Much can be understood about the Trinity through a consideration of the names by which they are revealed. Collectively, the Trinity refer to themselves as God. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for God, *'Elohim* (translated in the New Testament by the common Greek word for God, *theos*), is technically a plural of a word originally meaning "mighty one"; collectively then, the Trinity share this appellation, pluralized to express additional majesty.

Individually considered, however, members of the Trinity in the Old Testament are referred to most commonly by the Hebrew word *Yahweh* (translated in the New Testament by the common Greek word for Lord, *kyrios*), a word that, as we have seen, calls special attention to the Lord's timeless and dynamic being (see [section I, note 1](https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm#N_1_)). These two names, God and Lord, emphasize respectively the unity of the Trinity in its three-fold persons (*'Elohim* is plural but refers to the Trinity collectively), and the joint divine-essence of all three individual members (*Yahweh* is singular but can be used to refer to any of the Trinity's members individually).

---

#### The Names of the Trinity: Individual Names {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-the-names-of-the-trinity-individual-names}

With the fuller revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament following the revelation and advent of Jesus Christ (see [Part II C. for the Trinity in the Old Testament](https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm#C.%20The%20Trinity%20in%20the%20Old%20Testament)), the names Father, Son and Holy Spirit give us an even clearer understanding of the roles of the Trinity (and therefore of the Trinity itself).

Cf. the general concept of so-called *progressive revelation*. This is an excellent example of the phenomenon.

---

##### The Father (the 1st Person of the Trinity) {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-the-father-the-1st-person-of-the-trinity}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-roles-father">Trinity > Roles > Father</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

*Origin*: The term for and idea of the Fatherhood of God, a designation well known from the New Testament, is also found in the Old Testament from the Pentateuch onward. The word Father is first used for God in Deuteronomy 32:6: "Is He not your Father? The One who bought you? He is the One who made you and established you." Later in verse 18 of the same chapter, God is referred to as "the Rock who fathered you". The concept of the fatherhood of God can also be seen at Exodus 4:22, where Israel is referred to as God's "firstborn son".

---

*Significance*: The use of the name "Father" is clearly intended to be taken as an analogy from human experience. Like the father who sired us, He is our creator. Like a father, He is our authority figure, our trainer, disciplinarian, and teacher (Heb.12:5-11). And, not to be underestimated, He is the One who cares for us and loves us deeply, who protects us, keeps us safe, and wants only what is truly best for us (regardless of what we see as best).

Being human, our earthly fathers had strengths and weaknesses, and despite their best intentions had to act on the basis of imperfect information about what was best for us. But our heavenly Father represents the perfect ideal of fatherhood. He acts toward us always in perfect love, and all He does for us is without question for our ultimate good, for whether He disciplines us or blesses us, He does so in perfect knowledge of who we are, and of all that is in our hearts.

---

*Person*: The Father is often referred to as the 1st person of the Trinity (i.e., the authoritative "I" person), because He speaks to us as "I", directly manifesting His ***authoritative*** will as our God, creator and ruler of the universe (e.g., Ex.3:14-15; Is.46:9-10).

---

##### The Son (the 2nd Person of the Trinity) {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-the-son-the-2nd-person-of-the-trinity}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-roles-son">Trinity > Roles > Son</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

*Origin*: Along with the holy angels (Job 38:7 [not NIV]), we believers are all "sons" of God (Rom.8:14; Gal.3:26; 4:5; cf. Jn.1:12; 1Jn.3:1-2). This widespread franchise of sonship is based upon the paternal position of the Father relative to all His obedient creatures, but there is only one "*the* Son of God (our Lord, Jesus Christ)".

Though Christ's incarnation was, in a veiled fashion, prophesied and foreshadowed by ritual and sacrifice, it remained in Old Testament times very much a mystery until the time of His actual first advent. Now it stands clearly revealed that *the* archetypical Son of God is our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the Old Testament parallels are types that look forward to this revelation. For example:

- Adam is the son of God (Lk.3:38) -- Christ is *the* preeminent "last Adam" (1Cor.15:45; and cf. the "Son of Man [i.e., *'adam*]" of Dan.7:13-14 as well as New Testament usage)
- Israel is the servant of God (Is.42:18ff) -- Christ is *the* suffering Servant who takes away the sins of the world (Is.42:1; 52:13 - 53:12)
- Israel is God's son -- Christ is *the* Son (Hos.11:1 fulfilled at Matt.2:15)
- Finally, though Solomon was David's direct descendant, Christ is his ultimate descendant, the Messiah, *the* Son of David who is also the Son of God (Ps.2:7-12; 110:1).

---

*Significance*: Building on the idea of fatherhood as discussed above, sonship denotes the idea of a special and unbreakable relationship with the Father, one of dutiful subordination to the Father's will, but also one of special privilege, inheritance and shared authority.

A son (especially a king's son) is often more accessible than a father. The role of mediator between the king and His offending subjects can only be played by someone who is on a par with both the Father-king and creature-subjects: only a Son (incarnate) can be sent on such a mission of reconciliation (cf. Matt.21:33-40).

---

*Person*: The Son is often referred to as the 2nd person (i.e., the accessible "you" person), because He is ***accessible*** to us, having appeared in the flesh to forge a relationship with us on the Father's behalf (e.g., Jn.15:14-15), and having gained access to the Father for us (Jn.14:6; Eph.2:18; 3:12).

---

##### The Holy Spirit (the 3rd Person of the Trinity) {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-the-holy-spirit-the-3rd-person-of-the-trinity}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-roles-holy-spirit">Trinity > Roles > Holy Spirit</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

*Origin*: From the first chapter of the Old Testament (Gen.1:2), to the closing chapter of the New Testament (Rev.22:17), the word "spirit" is used to refer to God the Holy Spirit. The Hebrew and Greek words for "spirit", *ruach* and *pneuma* respectively, have the core meaning of "wind" or "breeze", and, again, there are important points to be garnered from the name analogy.

---

*Significance*: The wind is a potent, invisible force. Though we perceive it and experience its effects, we can neither see where it has come from or where it is going to (Jn.3:8). It can have everything from a gentle, warming influence to a powerful, chilling effect. "Wind" is thus an aptly descriptive analogy for the Holy Spirit's role in the plan of God: His invisible yet powerful support of good (Zech.4:6; 1Cor.12:3) and restraint of evil (Gen.6:3; 1Cor.12:3; 2Thes.2:5-8) in the furtherance of the plan of God must not be underestimated.

---

*Person*: The Holy Spirit is often referred to as the 3rd person of the Trinity (i.e., the unseen "he" person), because unlike the Father, He does not speak directly to us, and unlike the Son, He has not been made manifest to us; instead, like the wind, He is ***unseen*** by us, but, like the wind, that does not mean that we do not experience His power in a very personal and dynamic way (Jn.14:16-17; Gal.5:22-26).

---

##### Note: Analogies Are Just Analogies, and Nothing More {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god-note-analogies-are-just-analogies-and-nothing-more}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#interpretation-not-pushing-analogies-too-far">Interpretation > Not pushing analogies too far</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

As should be clear from the discussion above, the names Father, Son, and Spirit are thus representative of the Trinity's individual roles in the plan of God for mankind, and have been given to help us understand the relationships and functions of the three divine personalities in that plan.

The names themselves must not be pushed beyond the clearly intended analogies to our human frame of reference as outlined above. This is no small caveat, for it is largely on the basis of the title "Son" that heresies of the past have sought to deny the full and equal divinity of Christ (e.g., casting Him as subordinate in essence to the Father as hyper-Arianism does). 

The case of the Spirit also shows how wrong-headed such analyses based solely on these titles are, for the Spirit is not at all "inanimate" or "impersonal" even though "wind" is a fitting description of His invisible yet powerful role in our Christian lives. He acts in a very personal way towards us and towards the other members of the Trinity (Jn.3:5; 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26; 16:8-15; Acts 5:3, 5:9; 13:2; 16:6-10; Rom.8:26; 1Cor.2:10; Rev.2:7), and as our Comforter-Encourager (Jn.14:16; 16:7). The relationship of leadership (Rom.8:4; Gal.5:16 & 18), encouragement (cf. Jn.14:16; 16:7; 2Cor.1:3-7) and empowerment (Lk.24:49; Rom.15:13) we receive from the Holy Spirit are some of the most "personal" and "animating" relationships we shall ever experience this side of heaven.

#### Matthew 3:16-17 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-matthew-3-16-17}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Matthew 3:16-17" %}}
Now once **Jesus** had been baptized, He immediately came up out of the water, and, behold!, the heavens opened for Him, and He saw the **Spirit** of God coming down like a dove and lighting upon Him. And, behold!, a **voice** from heaven was saying, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

The baptism of Christ had a much different symbolism from any other baptism John ever undertook. John had (rightly) understood the normal meaning of his unique baptism to be a visible act of repentance and a symbolic washing away of sins. This explains why he was reluctant to baptize the sinless Messiah (Matt.3:14). But in the case of Christ, the symbolism is different: His entrance into the water represents His willingness to submerge Himself into our sins (therefore to die for them); whereas His coming up out of the water represents His resurrection. In this, the role of the Trinity in Christ's victory over death at the cross in death and resurrection is symbolized: the Son who undertook the *mission* to save us from our sins comes back to life (in His humanity); the Holy Spirit *quickens* Him (1Pet.3:18); and the Father who sent the Son *pronounces* His work and sacrifice satisfactory, efficacious and well-pleasing.

<!-- --- -->

#### John 14:16 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-john-14-16}

{{% ichthys-translation p="John 14:16" %}}
And **I** will ask the **Father** and He will give you another **Comforter**, that He may be with you forever.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

This verse shows the Father in a position of *authority*, the Son *interceding* on behalf of believers, and the Holy Spirit being sent *to help* us.

<!-- --- -->

#### 1 Corinthians 12:4-6 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-1-corinthians-12-4-6}

{{% ichthys-translation p="1st Corinthians 12:4-6" %}}
There are different gifts, but the same **Spirit**; and there are different ministries, but the same **Lord**; and there are different results, but the same **God** who brings about all results in all cases.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

Here we see clearly the respective roles of the Trinity in supporting our Christian ministry in life. The Holy Spirit gives us our particular spiritual gift(s) (cf. 1Cor.12:11); specific ministries are said to be assigned by our Lord Jesus Christ; and the Father is said to oversee and empower the results of those ministries: God gives us the gift (the Holy Spirit: He *empowers* us); God gives us the ministry (the Lord Jesus Christ: we share in His *mission*); God gives us the results (the Father: all effects are part of His *plan*).

<!-- --- -->

#### 2 Corinthians 13:14 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-2-corinthians-13-14}

{{% ichthys-translation p="2 Corinthians 13:14" %}}
May the grace of the **Lord Jesus Christ**, and the love of **God**, and the fellowship of the **Holy Spirit** be with you all.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

The Trinity is seen here from the standpoint of salvation, before, during and after: The <u>love</u> of the Father *sends* the Son to die for sinful mankind (cf. Jn.3:16); The Son's *sacrifice* reconciles us with the Father by satisfying the requirements of the Father's righteousness, and thus providing <u>grace</u>, that is, salvation free to us since He paid; The Spirit *unites* in <u>fellowship</u> with God all who accept this offer of grace (based on Christ's death) originating in God's love.

<!-- --- -->

#### Ephesians 3:14-17 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-ephesians-3-14-17}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Ephesians 3:14-17" %}}
For this reason I bow my knees to the **Father**, from whom His entire family in heaven and on earth has received its name, that He may grant you according to the riches of His glory to be powerfully strengthened in your inner person through His **Spirit**, so that, rooted and grounded in love, **Christ** may dwell in your hearts through faith.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

In this apostolic prayer of Paul, we see the Father as the *authority* to whom Paul prays; he prays for us to be *strengthened* by the Holy Spirit; the object of his prayer is that we may grow to be *more like* our Savior, Jesus Christ, and improve our relationship with Him in every way.

<!-- --- -->

#### Ephesians 4:4-6 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-ephesians-4-4-6}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Ephesians 4:4-6" %}}
There is one body and One **Spirit** – just as when you were called it was in one hope that you were called. There is One **Lord** [Jesus Christ], one faith, one baptism. There is One **God and Father** of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

In this precís of the "unity of the faith" (Eph.4:3), Paul reminds us of some of the most important common factors of our Christian faith. In doing so, certain aspects of individual Trinity roles are emphasized: the Holy Spirit's role in bringing us into the body of Christ through His baptizing of us into Christ, and our concomitant *hope* of resurrection in Christ; the Lord Jesus Christ's role as our object of *faith* and the Spirit baptism by which we enter into union with Him through that *faith*; the Father's role as the unifying God of *love*, who knits His family of believers together in every way.

<!-- --- -->

#### 1 Peter 1:1-2 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-1-peter-1-1-2}

{{% ichthys-translation p="1 Peter 1:1-2" %}}
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who, though outcasts dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, were yet selected in the foreknowledge of **God the Father**, by means of the **Holy Spirit's** consecration, for the obedience in and sprinkling of the blood of **Jesus Christ**.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

Peter tells us that we believers are elected to eternal life according to the Father's *plan* of salvation, the Holy Spirit's *implementation* of salvation for us when we believe, and the Son's *work* of salvation, in which and in whom we put our faith.

<!-- --- -->

#### Revelation 1:4-6 {#trinity-roles-as-seen-from-specific-new-testament-scriptures-revelation-1-4-6}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Revelation 1:4-6" %}}
Grace to you and peace from the **One who is and was and is coming**, and from the seven **Spirits** which are before His throne, and from **Jesus Christ**, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

In John's salutation from the Trinity, the Father's eternity and imminent taking of *possession of the devil's world*, the Spirit's *supervision of the devil's world* (see Rev.5:6; Is.11:2), and the Son's *victory and conquest over the devil's world* are emphasized.

#### Given the benefit of subsequent clarifying New Testament revelation, the Trinity is visible in the Old Testament {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-old-testament-given-the-benefit-of-subsequent-clarifying-new-testament-revelation-the-trinity-is-visible-in-the-old-testament}

The Trinity is not only present in the verses of the Old Testament, but portrayed clearly enough to see (with the benefit of New Testament revelation).
- When God says "let *us* make Man in *our* image (Gen.1:26)
- When the angels of God praise Him with their three-fold "holy, holy, holy" (Is.6:3)
- When Aaron's sons are told to "put My name" on the Israelites with a triple blessing (Num.6:24-26)

In these cases and others, the clear intent is to reflect (if not to convey) the triune nature of God. Moreover, some Old Testament scriptures cast the Trinity in even sharper relief, such as king David's last words which in quick succession refer to God as "the Spirit of the Lord", "the God of Israel", and "the Rock of Israel" (2Sam.23:2-3; see 1Cor.10:4 for the image of Christ as Israel's Rock). There are many other passages commonly cited to demonstrate the reality of the Trinity in the Old Testament, a reality shimmering just beneath the veil (e.g., Is.48:15-17; 63:9-10), but perhaps the best example is the one used by our Lord to demonstrate that His divinity was indeed prophesied by scripture (cf. Zech.2:7-13): Matthew 22:41-46. We'll look at this passage next.

<!-- --- -->

#### Matthew 22:41-46 {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-old-testament-matthew-22-41-46}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Matthew 22:41-46" %}}
As the Pharisees were gathering together, Jesus put a question to them, saying "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They answered Him, "David's son." Then He said to them, "Well then, how can David, speaking in the Spirit, call Him Lord? For he says,  
&emsp;&emsp;The Lord said to My Lord,  
&emsp;&emsp;"Sit down at my right hand,  
&emsp;&emsp;until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." [Psalm 110:1]  
So if David calls Him Lord, how is He his Son?" And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare to question Him any longer from that day forward.                  
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

We are not to assume that David, when he penned this prophecy under divine inspiration, saw the coming Christ as clearly as he wished to. Indeed, we have it from Christ that "many prophets and righteous men desired to see" what was being revealed to Jesus' generation face to face, namely, the unveiling of the Messiah (Matt.13:17; Lk.10:24; cf. Jn.8:56; 1Pet.1:10-12). The revelation of Jesus Christ to the world during His 1st Advent, in addition to explaining passages such as Ps.110:1 above (Christ is David's Son in His humanity, but David's Lord in His deity), is also, not coincidentally, the basis for explaining many other Old Testament passages that are only fully understood by means of our likewise now more complete understanding of the Trinity.

<!-- --- -->

#### Prophetic foreshortening {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-old-testament-prophetic-foreshortening}

In the Old Testament, the three Persons stand in front of us like three mighty mountains, one after the other, all partially visible, but not readily distinguishable from each other. Only with the revelation provided by the incarnation of Jesus Christ and the New Testament do we see the Old Testament picture of the Trinity from a sidelong perspective, so that now the three mountains become visible in their own right when viewed from this new vantage point.

We should note that all three mountains have always been there, even if humanity was not previously able to distinguish them from one another. One did not suddenly become three. Instead, our perspective merely changed.

This illustration of the Trinity in the Old Testament is commonly called "prophetic foreshortening". For more on this phenomenon, see [part 1 of Coming Tribulation, section IV.1.a, "Prophetical Foreshortening"](https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part1.htm#Foreshortening).

<!-- --- -->

#### Why did God decide to veil the triune nature of His essence in Old Testament times? {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-old-testament-why-did-god-decide-to-veil-the-triune-nature-of-his-essence-in-old-testament-times}

Exactly why did God decide to veil the triune nature of His essence in Old Testament times, choosing instead to only foreshadow it, in the manner discussed above?

Sometimes the explanation put forth for this veiling is the prevention of idolatry: God did not make His triune nature known to Israel in Old Testament times to help them avoid falling into idolatry (the mechanics of which we will examine in a moment). While this explanation has merit, it is not alone sufficient. We will instead argue that God did not reveal Himself in triune form before the 1st Advent of Christ simply because the Trinity can only be clearly explained and understood after the 1st Advent of Christ.

In any case, the point is God has good reasons for His progressive revelation of truth to humanity, and we need to have unshakeable faith in His wisdom and judgment. God knows what He is doing... and not in the way we humans think we do. For He is control of *everything*, and nothing happens except that which is part of His Plan.

<!-- --- -->

##### Idolatry as an explanation for God's veiling of His nature {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-old-testament-idolatry-as-an-explanation-for-god-s-veiling-of-his-nature}

Idolatry, a major problem in ancient times and one of Israel's most serious stumbling blocks, is often adduced as the reason for this veiling in pre-Christian times of our present knowledge of the Trinity. Certainly it is true that the threat of idolatry to the faith and practice of Old Testament believers was a very real one. We need only to consider that the first two of the "ten commandments" deal with this subject (Ex.20:1-6), and that Balaam's counsel of idolatrous seduction was more destructive to Israel than any curse could ever have been (Num.25). The argument suggests that there was, therefore, a need to emphasize the *oneness* of God in the face of this very real polytheistic threat, thus obviating any possible twisting of a proper understanding of the Trinity. This explanation possesses much of value, but it does not entirely resolve the matter.

Pagan pantheons (not to mention pagan religions) are different from God and the true worship of Him in every way, and this would have been obvious to true believers, revelation of the Trinity notwithstanding. To state but two obvious points of departure, pagan pantheons are never even close to being "one" in purpose as the Trinity is (Jn.10:30; cf. 1Cor.3:8), nor are their individual members so integral to the existence of the whole.

##### The person of Jesus Christ not yet come as an explanation for God's veiling of His nature {#introduction-the-trinity-in-the-old-testament-the-person-of-jesus-christ-not-yet-come-as-an-explanation-for-god-s-veiling-of-his-nature}

The full answer lies in the person of Jesus Christ. Before the fact, before we see with our own eyes Christ come in the flesh, His humility, His suffering, His sacrifice for us, can we really appreciate in full the Trinity and what God has chosen to do for us in Christ's incarnation and death on the cross? Without the *accomplished reality* of the incarnation of Jesus, how could we ever but dimly conceive the glory of it? And without the accomplished fact of His incarnation, how could we possibly understand and appreciate the triune nature of God? For it is only through Christ – after He has come into the world in person – that we begin to see God with the clarity of vision it has now been given us to possess (Jn.1:18; 14:9).

<!-- --- -->

Just as the temple veil that symbolically separated us from the presence of God was split in two by Christ's sacrifice on our behalf (Matt.27:51), so the veil that in the Old Testament partially obscured the person of Christ from our view has been lifted by His actual advent in the flesh – to die on our behalf. So that now, through our faith in Jesus Christ, we see God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit more clearly than we ever could before:

{{% ichthys-translation p="2 Corinthians 4:6" %}}
For God who said, "Let light shine forth from the darkness!", is He who has shone forth [His light] into our hearts to illuminate our knowledge of God's glory ***in the person of Jesus Christ***.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="2 Corinthians 3:14" %}}
For until this very day, the same veil remains [upon their unbelieving hearts] when the Old Testament is read, and it is not removed [when they hear these scriptures], because it is [only] done away with ***in Christ***.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

So:

- We see the Son more clearly after He comes into the world (Jn.1:14).
- The Son can only reveal the Father more clearly after He comes into the world (Jn.1:18).
- The Spirit cannot be sent to indwell believers until after the Son has been glorified (Jn.7:39).

And therefore:

- The Trinity can only be clearly explained and understood after the 1st Advent of Christ, a task undertaken by the New Testament.
- While in the Old Testament, before the 1st Advent, the members of the Trinity are, understandably, not as clearly distinguished as they are in the New Testament.

#### Introduction: the Old Testament's portrayal of the suffering of Christ {#the-messiah-pre-figured-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-old-testament-s-portrayal-of-the-suffering-of-christ}

Contrary to much conventional wisdom about the Old Testament, Jesus Christ and His sacrifice on our behalf is depicted everywhere in the Old Testament. Furthermore, we know from New Testament scripture that the necessity for the mission and suffering of the Messiah was understood clearly enough by Old Testament believers (as Christ explains on the road to Emmaus: Lk.24:27; see also 1Pet.1:10-12 and Heb.11:26).

In fact, there are in the Old Testament a large variety of "types" employed to pre-figure the incarnation, death and suffering of the Son of God on our behalf. The subject of typology will be covered in more extensive detail in [part 4A of this series (Christology)](https://ichthys.com/4A-Christo.htm), but two major categories of the Old Testament's portrayal of the suffering of Christ should be mentioned now:

<!-- --- -->

#### Blood sacrifice {#the-messiah-pre-figured-in-the-old-testament-blood-sacrifice}

From the coats of skin that God provides for Adam and Eve to indicate that One will die in their place (Gen.3:21), to Abel's sacrifice, superior to Cain's because it depicts the Substitute's death (Gen.4:4), to the Noahic covenant demanding respect for blood that represents the death of Another in our place (Gen.9:4), to the whole elaborate series of sacrifices commanded by the Mosaic law, all of which portray redemption through Another's blood (cf. Heb.9:22ff.), God made extensive use of the "teaching aid" of blood sacrifice in order that it might be crystal clear to all Old Testament believers that forgiveness of their sins was no light matter: it was something that only God could do for them, and it involved a steep and bloody price that God would somehow have to pay Himself on behalf of those who trusted in Him.

<!-- --- -->

#### Prophecy {#the-messiah-pre-figured-in-the-old-testament-prophecy}

The substitutionary suffering and death of Christ on our behalf is predicted and prophesied throughout the Old Testament, for example:

- Genesis 3:15: He will crush your head, and you, [serpent], will strike His heel.
- Numbers 21:9: So Moses made a bronze serpent and put it on a staff. And it came to pass that whoever was bitten by a serpent then looked at the bronze serpent would live.
- Psalm 22:1: My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?
- Isaiah 53:3: He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with suffering.

#### Overview {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-overview}

In terms of their presentation of the Trinity, the main difference between the Old and New Testaments is that in the New Testament, Christ is clearly visible and distinct from the Father, while in the Old Testament, the Father and Son are often difficult to distinguish. Despite the discussion immediately above, there is a common misconception – even in many Christian circles – that the fact that the exact details about Christ's incarnation were shielded in the Old Testament means that the *visible* person in the Old Testament is primarily God the Father.

This is not entirely accurate, for the Father has always appeared to the world *through* the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, and this fact was just as true in the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament; only the *manner* of the Father's representation of Himself through His Son changed: in the New Testament, an *incarnate* Jesus Christ becomes visible to the world (only His true glory is shielded), while in the Old Testament, Christ also represents the Father – but not in *incarnate* form.

Additionally, in the New Testament, when our Lord says "I and the Father are one" (Jn.10:30), or otherwise speaks the Father's words (Jn.8:28; 14:24), the distinction between the Father and the Son (along with this unity) is perfectly clear and obvious. However, in the Old Testament, when God appears, it is consistently the Son who appears, but as the representative of the Father, speaking the Father's words, so that the distinction between the two was not, at the time, completely understood or appreciated (Jn.8:26 & 28):

#### Definition of Theophany and Christophany {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-definition-of-theophany-and-christophany}

The words "Theophany" and "Christophany" mean, respectively, "an appearance of God" and "an appearance of Christ", the second part of each being derived from the Greek root *phan*, "appear" (from which we get the word "phenomenon"). In this section it will be argued that in biblical terms, at any rate, the only category of event we really need to be concerned with here is Christophany, for, in my view, all cases of Theophany in the Old Testament are really Christophanies.

It needs to be made clear right at the outset that by Christophany we are definitely not referring to the literal, physical appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ in His true humanity – ever since His deity assumed true humanity at the incarnation, Christ has not again appeared in temporary, Christophanic form. The position that all Old Testament appearances of God are, in reality, appearances of Christ, also allows for the possibility of other sorts of manifestations of the Father other than an ostensibly corporeal appearance here on earth, such as a dream or vision (Daniel's vision of the "Ancient of Days" being the prime example: Dan.7:13-14).

<!-- --- -->

#### The invisibility of the Father {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-invisibility-of-the-father}

Until we get to heaven, we will not see the Father. We know that the Father is not invisible to the angels, for they "constantly see the face of My Father in heaven" (Matt.18:10). But He is our *heavenly* Father (Matt.6:9, 26, et passim), and as long as the earthly conflict between His would-be usurper, Satan, and His designated regent, Christ, still rages, in heaven He remains for His majesty's sake, speaking and working His will through His Servant. Until the final and ultimate victory, and only after the complete purging of the universe will the Father come to the new earth to make His abode with us forever (Rev.21:1-3). Until that time, the Father, though acting and speaking through His representative, His Son Jesus Christ, remains invisible to human eye.

#### The inaccessibility of the Father apart from Christ {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-inaccessibility-of-the-father-apart-from-christ}

If mankind were able to see God the Father in all His glory without perishing in the process, it is at least safe to say that the issue of human free-will would be seriously compromised from that point forward. Confronted with the magnitude and majesty of God, not only would it be impossible to deny His existence, but it is also likely that even against their will most men would find themselves obliged to follow Him and His will out of sheer terror (rather than from a truly free choice). Along with the principle of preserving mankind's free-will, the issue of *access* to the Father also helps to explain why the Father remains unseen to us in this present life.

Although, as discussed earlier in this study, the Father is omnipresent in His creation, for purposes of visibility to His creatures, he is invariably described in the scriptures as residing in heaven (e.g., Matt.6:9, 26). Obviously, as long as we live in these physical bodies, we cannot go to heaven to "seek God" (Deut.30:12-13; Rom.10:6). The Father, by virtue of the fact that His throne room is in heaven (Rev.4:2; Heb.4:16), is inaccessible to us. This "physical" distance which separates us from the Father is indicative of the *spiritual* distance between God and mankind. As the person of the Trinity representing the authority and holiness of the Godhead, the righteous Father keeps Himself completely separate from human sin; it is in no small part because of mankind's sinfulness that face to face fellowship with the Father is impossible. In fact, for sinful human beings to be confronted by God brings immediate realization that we are worthy of death by our very nature (Gen.32:30):

{{% ichthys-translation p="Isaiah 6:5" %}}
"Woe is me! I am done for! For I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

Though we cannot go to heaven to plead our case with the Father, Christ Jesus is the one who has come down from heaven on our account (Jn.3:13). Through faith in Him and His death for us, we now have ***access*** to the Father in His name. By His blood (that is, His death on the cross on our behalf), Christ has broken down the barrier of hostility between the Father and those who believe in His Son. Jesus Christ has made peace between us, and, as a result, we now have been granted entrance into the throne room of heaven and the presence of the Father. This means that on the basis of the acceptability of Christ's sacrifice and our acceptance of Him, our prayers and petitions are heard by the Father now, and we ourselves shall enter into the heavenly holy of holies in His good time:

{{% ichthys-translation p="Romans 5:1-2a" %}}
So now that we have been justified by faith, let us take hold of the peace [we have] with God [the Father] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have also obtained our ***access*** into this grace in which we stand.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Ephesians 2:18" %}}
For through Him [Jesus Christ] we both [Jews and gentiles] have ***access*** to the Father by one Spirit.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

{{% ichthys-translation p="Ephesians 3:12" %}}
Being in Him [Jesus Christ] and having confidence through our faith in Him we possess this ***access*** [to the Father] and freedom to speak [to Him].
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="Hebrews 4:16" %}}
So let us ***approach*** with confident free speech to the throne of grace [of the Father] that we might receive [His] mercy and gain [His] favor for timely help.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

{{% ichthys-translation p="1 Peter 3:18" %}}
For Christ died once for us on account of our sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might ***bring*** us to God.
{{% /ichthys-translation %}}

<!-- --- -->

The fact that through faith in the Son we now have full ***access*** to the Father (sonship, fellowship, acceptance of prayer, and eternal life with Him), shows that before the Son came and died for us, such access was at least *limited*. The Father's splitting of the temple's veil at the conclusion of our Lord's sacrifice on our behalf is a dramatic indication that through His death the barrier that had previously separated us from the Father (that is, our sins) has now been removed (Lk.23:45). Now we have access to the Father in prayer, though we still cannot enter into His presence in heaven as long as we remain in these earthly bodies. Before the cross, the Father was even more inaccessible to sinful mankind. It would be surprising, therefore, if the instances of Theophany in the Old Testament are actual appearances of the Father. It is much more likely (based upon this principle of greater access *after* the cross, less beforehand) that just as the Father made Himself known through His Son in the New Testament (Heb.1:1-2), so also in the Old Testament His appearances were mediated by this same Son, that is to say, by Christophany.

<!-- --- -->

#### The dignity of the Father {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-dignity-of-the-father}

The fact that the angelic rebellion led by Satan precedes the creation of man (Job 38:7; Is.14:12-15; Ezek.28:12-19) explains much about the Father's modus operandi of working through the One who will ultimately replace Satan as ruler of this world, His Son Jesus Christ (Lk.10:18; Jn.12:31; 16:11; 1Cor.15:24-25; Col.2:15; Rev.11:15). As the Trinity's figure of authority and majesty, the Father chooses a representative to wage the struggle against Satan, even He who by His sacrifice will redeem sinful mankind and replace our adversary, the Morning Star replacing Lucifer (compare Is.14:12 with Rev.22:16). So it should not be surprising that throughout the Old Testament too, the Son is the One representing the Father, speaking His words whenever He appears (in Christophany), for He is the anointed One, the Messiah, the One sent into the world by the Father (Matt.10:40; 21:37; Lk.9:48; 10:16; Jn.12:44; 13:20). This principle of the Son *representing* the Father as His agent in the plan of salvation can also be seen from Christ's...

<!-- --- -->

1) **Message**: Christ is the Word (Jn.1:1-3). This means that He is the embodiment of the message and truth of the Father, and speaks the Father's words truly and precisely at all times (Deut.18:18; Jn.8:55; 14:10&24). Christ is the Father's ultimate message (Heb.1:1), the messenger of the Father's new covenant in His blood (Is.42:6; Jer.31:31ff.; Mal.3:1; Matt.26:28; 1Cor.11:25).

2) **Mediation**: Christ is the Mediator between God the Father and sinful mankind (Gal.3:19-20; 1Tim.2:5), the One who reconciles us to the Father by His blood (Rom.5:10-11; 2Cor.5:18-21; Eph.2:14-16; Col.1:20-22).

3) **Mission**: Christ is the One anointed and sent by the Father to offer Himself as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb.9:11-14). He is thus the ultimate high priest who makes atonement to the Father on our behalf (Heb.5:5-10).

4) **Monarchy**: In recognition of His victory at the cross, the Father has "appointed Him Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36), that is "the Lord anointed (to rule the world)". This passage signals not only Christ's replacement of Satan as ruler of the world, but His acceptance of the regency of the world as the Father's representative (explaining many Old Testament passages referring to the Father's impending return being applied to the Son in the New Testament):

a) the Son's ascension into heaven (Ps.110:1 with Matt.22:44);  
b) the Son's ascension to the throne on earth (Ps.45:6-7 with Heb.1:8-9);  
c) the Son's primacy from creation to eternity (Ps.97:7b with Heb.1:6).  

All the above examples of Christ's role of *representing* the Father in God's plan of salvation support the position that all Old Testament Theophany is truly Christophany, the Son appearing, representing, and speaking for the Father before His incarnation.

<!-- --- -->

#### The visibility, accessibility and humility of the Son {#appearances-of-christ-in-the-old-testament-introduction-the-visibility-accessibility-and-humility-of-the-son}

While we cannot initially see the Father, we can see the Son and the Father through the Son (Jn.14:9). While we could not initially approach the Father, through the Son we have gained access to Him (Jn.14:6). And while our sinfulness kept us separated from the perfect holiness of the Father, the work of the Son has rendered us holy and has reconciled us to the Father (Col.1:22). As the visible, accessible member of the Trinity who was willing to humble Himself and associate with us to die for us (Phil.2:5-11), Christ has always been our point of contact with the Godhead, whether in Old Testament Christophany, or after His appearance in true humanity following His incarnation.
