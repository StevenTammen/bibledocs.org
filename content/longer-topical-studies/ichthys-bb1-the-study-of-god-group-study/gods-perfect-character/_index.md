### Introduction: God's perfect character {#introduction-god-s-perfect-character}

{{< subjects >}}

{{< /subjects >}}
<!-- p="Matthew 5:48" -->

God is perfect in His character, irreproachable and blameless in every possible way.

{{% nt t="ESV" h="300px" p="Matthew 5:48" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 5:48 | NIV11" %}}
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
{{% /scripture-h %}}

{{% scripture-l p="Matthew 5:48 | NIrV" %}}
So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /nt %}}

When firmly grasped, God's perfection---perfection in every way and according to any conceivable true standard---is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His motives*. God's perfect character will never be less than the highest, the best, and the purest that the human mind can comprehend.

### God is Good {#god-is-good}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-good">God > Is good</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is good (Hebrew *tov*: טוב); it is the antithesis of evil. So how does goodness respond to sinful man? In His goodness, God always has our best interests at heart. Therefore His desire for us to be free from evil and devoted to good is genuine. Even though we are sinful and by nature unworthy of His blessing, in His goodness God has nevertheless found a *gracious* way to redeem us from sin without compromising His character, namely, by giving us the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Holy {#god-is-holy}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-holy">God > Is holy</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is holy (Hebrew *qadosh*: קדוש); it is completely separate from evil. So how does holiness respond to sinful man? In His holiness, God can never compromise His perfect standards for any reason. Therefore His commitment to condemning evil and rewarding good is inviolable. But even though we are sinful and by nature deserving of His judgment, in His holiness God has nevertheless found a *merciful* way to justify us in spite of our sin without violating His character, namely, by judging His Son, Jesus Christ in our place.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Faithful and True {#god-is-faithful-and-true}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-faithful-and-true">God > Is faithful and true</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's character is faithful and true (Hebrew: *omen*, *emeth*: אמת ,אמון); it is actively opposed to evil. So how do truth and faithfulness respond to sinful man? In His faithfulness and truth, God is entirely reliable and trustworthy in all that He promises to us and does for us. Therefore His veracity and dependability in offering us a way through Jesus Christ to escape the evil of death and embrace the good of eternal life are beyond reproach. So even though we are sinful and by nature objects of His wrath, in His faithfulness and truth God has nevertheless found a way to make *peace* between Himself and us and to remove the enmity between Himself and us, caused by our sins, without corrupting His character, namely, by reconciling us to Himself through the death of His Son, Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Sovereign {#god-is-sovereign}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-sovereign">God > Is sovereign</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-de-jure-ruler-of-the-universe">God > Is *de jure* ruler of the universe</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Sovereignty comes from God's perfect character. No one else has a legitimate right to rule over the universe. He is the absolute sovereign within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due. Sovereignty thus speaks to God's *moral authority* and *right* to order the universe however He chooses.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His goodness, holiness and truth (essential qualities independent of His creation). From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the moral universe, He is sovereign by virtue of His love, justice, and life (qualities applying to His creation which correspond to goodness, holiness and truth).

Only God is qualified to be the ultimate judge of the morally accountable creatures He has created, and thus to hold them responsible for their actions. As *de facto* ruler of the universe (through His infinite nature) and *de jure* ruler of the universe (through His perfect character):

<!-- --- -->

#### God possesses the sovereign authority to demonstrate *love* to His sinful creatures out of His own *goodness* {#god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-demonstrate-love-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-own-goodness}

Not ignoring their sins, as evil suggests He should, but *paying* for them Himself by the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (redemption). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **grace** (Hebrew *chen*: חן; Greek *charis*: χάρις).

<!-- --- -->

#### God possesses the sovereign authority to administer *justice* to His sinful creatures out of His *holiness* {#god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-administer-justice-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-holiness}

Not abandoning them to their sins, as evil suggests He must, but *forgiving* them Himself on the basis of the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (justification). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **mercy** (Hebrew *chesed*: חסד; Greek *eleos*: ἔλεος).

<!-- --- -->

#### God possesses the sovereign authority to give *life* to His sinful creatures out of His *truth* and *faithfulness* {#god-possesses-the-sovereign-authority-to-give-life-to-his-sinful-creatures-out-of-his-truth-and-faithfulness}

Not allowing them to die in their sins, as evil suggests He will, but *reconciling* them to Himself through the death on the cross of His Son, Jesus Christ, in their place (reconciliation). We call the result of this act of His sovereignty **peace** (Hebrew *shalom*: שלום; Greek *eirene*: εἰρήνη).

<!-- --- -->

#### Summary: God's sovereignty in action {#summary-god-s-sovereignty-in-action}

| Essential Quality | Manifesting in creation as | Action God takes                  | God's sovereign attitude towards us | Result         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Goodness          | Love                       | Paying for sin                    | Grace                               | Redemption     |
| Holiness          | Justice                    | Forgiving sin                     | Mercy                               | Justification  |
| Truth             | Life                       | Reconciling sinful man to Himself | Peace                               | Reconciliation |

In this---God's full plan for saving sinful man---absolutely everything relies upon the cross, the blood of Jesus Christ. One particularly memorable way I have heard it described is that "God's Mercy and Justice intersect in the cross."

### God is Love {#god-is-love}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-love">God > Is love</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Having love for His creatures, is a natural consequence of God's goodness. Out of the intrinsic goodness of His character, God loves us with a perfect love, desiring to help us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His holiness and justice in the process and forgive our sin without consequence (as evil suggests He should). Therefore God had to find a way to *reach out to us in love* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Grace* is the biblical name for God's policy of lovingly redeeming us from our sins through Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's gracious offer of love and redemption by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Just {#god-is-just}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-just">God > Is just</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Demanding justice for His creatures is a natural consequence of God's holiness. Out of the intrinsic holiness of His character, God must deal with us in perfect justice, righteously condemning us in our sinful state. However, He does not overlook His goodness and love in the process and abandon us to our sins (as evil suggests He will). For God found a way to *treat us as righteous* without compromising His character, and did so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf. *Mercy* is the biblical name for God's policy of justly forgiving us on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's merciful offer of justification by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

#### "How is it just for unbelievers to face infinite, eternal punishment for finite sins?" {#how-is-it-just-for-unbelievers-to-face-infinite-eternal-punishment-for-finite-sins}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#unlimited-atonement-double-jeopardy">Unlimited atonement > Double jeopardy</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#hell-people-are-sent-only-because-of-unbelief">Hell > People are sent only because of unbelief</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#hell-there-are-no-levels-in-hell">Hell > There are no levels in hell</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

{{% video-only-note %}}

This question's wording presupposes something that is simply not true: that unbelievers face eternal punishment in hell for personal sins they commit in this life.

As we go over in the video, hell exists *not* to punish unbelievers for their sins---as if they could somehow pay for or atone for them---but only because of unbelief ("blasphemy against the Holy Spirit"). That hell is not punishment for sins but the consequence of unbelief---of wanting to spend eternity apart from God---is a rather fundamental point about the nature of hell, but is nonetheless widely misunderstood.

Jesus paid for *all* human sin upon the cross, and, moreover, imperfect human beings are not even worthy sacrifices. That is, we could not pay for our sin even if we wanted to; we are not qualified since we are tainted and marred by sin. Only Christ---the true, blameless Lamb of God---can take away the sins of the world with His blood, and He already did so upon the cross some 2,000 years ago.

If God punished unbelievers for their sins in hell after Christ already took the judgement for said sins, the sins would be judged twice ("double jeopardy")---obviously incompatible with justice. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that falsely believing that human beings are punished for their sins in hell is no less than a rejection of the efficacy of Jesus' payment for all human sin upon the cross (or perhaps the Father's acceptance of Jesus' work). If you believe in unlimited atonement and so-called penal substitutionary atonement (both true things that are clearly taught in scripture), then the purpose (*telos*) of hell cannot be the punishment of human sins. It is simply theologically unworkable.

**To pull us back to the present question:**

The grace of the cross is positively scandalous:  
&emsp;That God would judge His own Son for human sin,  
&emsp;Even for the most gross and reprehensible sins of humanity.

That unbelievers refuse to accept Christ's payment for them is tragic:  
&emsp;That God's love will go unreciprocated,  
&emsp;Despite Him laying down His life for their salvation.

But that unbelievers accuse God of injustice is ironic:  
&emsp;That they scorn the God that loves them so much,  
&emsp;Who has already saved them from their punishment,  
&emsp;By taking it upon His own shoulders.

When unbelievers say it is not just for them to face infinite, eternal punishment for finite sins, they miss the fact that God *already judged Jesus for all their sins upon the cross*, and that people in hell are not there to punish them for their sins, but because they chose unbelief and separation from God. God has, out of His unfathomable grace, spared them the true consequences of their sins---Jesus bore these consequences instead, even for the most vile and unrepentant of unbelievers. Nevertheless, He will let all those creatures who choose of their own will to live apart from Him have their wish. And an eternity apart from God---who is everything good---will be utterly miserable.

The point is that hell is not miserable on account of punishment for sins committed, but miserable on account of separation from God.

{{% sidenote %}}
All of this should make it clear why the idea of "levels of hell" (cf. the ["Nine Circles of Hell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29#Nine_circles_of_Hell) in Dante's [*Inferno*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29)) is so problematic theologically.

Because all people in hell are there for the same reason (unbelief)---not to punish them for their personal sins---there can be no levels of hell.

That people find this unpalatable ("What do you mean Hitler will be no worse off in hell than my 'nice' unbelieving neighbor?!") does not make it any less true. As I have said before, the cross is truly scandalous grace---and what is even more scandalous is that God gives a real offer of salvation to every single human being who has ever lived... even those who---in our opinion---actually deserve a healthy dose of eternal suffering (e.g., those who rape and murder children). *That* is how far God has gone in offering a genuine choice to all mankind.

For people who still balk at this teaching (viewing it as too lenient upon the truly evil), consider Paul. If God made Paul (who---prior to his conversion in Acts 9---was a fierce persecutor of the Early Church) the Apostle to the Gentiles, then when you find fault with God for showing grace to sinners who you think are too evil, are you saying God made a mistake with Paul?

### God is Life {#god-is-life}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-life">God > Is life</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Saving the lives of His creatures is a natural consequence of God's truth and faithfulness. Out of the intrinsic veracity and trustworthiness of His character, God honors His gracious and merciful promise to restore us to Himself and thereby to eternal life, delivering us from the condemnation of death accruing to us in our sinful state. In doing so, however, He has not failed to resolve the competing demands of His goodness and love on the one hand, with those of His holiness and justice on the other (as evil suggests He must). For God has found a way in accordance with His character to *eliminate the wall of sin and consequent wrath which separates us from Him*, and has done so through the gift and sacrifice of His only Son on our behalf (He died that we might have life). *Peace* is the biblical name for God's life-giving policy of reconciling us to Himself on the basis of the work of Jesus Christ. We accept and receive God's offer of life, peace, and reconciliation by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.

{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right so right now we are going to be picking up with the next lesson in our series here on Bible basics part one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7" display="0:07" %}} - theology proper talking about God's perfect character so in the last lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="12" display="0:12" %}} - we were examining God's infinite nature and what that tells us about his abilities and now we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="17" display="0:17" %}} - picking up examining God's perfect character and how that can help us understand his motives and so here are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="25" display="0:25" %}} - the things that we are going to be going through in this lesson we're going to start out with an introduction of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="30" display="0:30" %}} - it means for God to have perfect character kind of talking a little bit about the word perfect uh the Greek word  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="36" display="0:36" %}} - as it shows up in Matthew 548 then we're going to be talking about how God is good and holy and faithful and true um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="44" display="0:44" %}} - these uh very similar to when we were talking about God's nature being essential characteristics of God that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="49" display="0:49" %}} - then manifest in the universe as love Justice and life um and so in the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="56" display="0:56" %}} - way that we kind of had the section in the last lesson uh talking about how God is unique serving as a bridge between  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="63" display="1:03" %}} - the essential characteristics of God and how they manifest in creation we're going to have that same sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="68" display="1:08" %}} - structure here with this section on how God is Sovereign um in fact this is even a bit more fleshed out than the God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="75" display="1:15" %}} - unique section from the last one and so you'll see what I mean when we get there this will probably be one of the larger  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - subsections in our examination of things in this study talking about um how God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="87" display="1:27" %}} - goodness Holiness and faithfulness and Truth manifest in terms of Love Justice and life and what that means in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="93" display="1:33" %}} - God's Sovereign control of all creation so these are the things that we are going to be talking about here in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="102" display="1:42" %}} - lesson all right so the first thing that we are going to be doing here to introduce the topic of this lesson is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="109" display="1:49" %}} - talking about God's perfect character which is irreplaceable and blameless and every way and so this is the verse here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="117" display="1:57" %}} - uh that we pull up uh to kind of introduce the topic Matthew 5: 48 says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="123" display="2:03" %}} - that you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="128" display="2:08" %}} - vocabulary here is the Greek word toos um so this is an adjective um and a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="134" display="2:14" %}} - little bit more than an English perhaps this word has the sense of completion of fullness of lacking nothing and so when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="141" display="2:21" %}} - we think of perfect in English um I don't know if we necessarily have all those same connotations that go along  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="147" display="2:27" %}} - with it but toos in Greek has this idea of something that has been uh fully  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="153" display="2:33" %}} - accomplished something that has been done realized it's at its end so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="158" display="2:38" %}} - speak it is brought to completion and that is the quotative sense of this of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="163" display="2:43" %}} - this word meaning perfect here in Greek and so that is what God is um so when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="169" display="2:49" %}} - grasped God's Perfection is perfection in every way and according to any conceivable true standard um and as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="176" display="2:56" %}} - say this is going to help us understand God's motives um as a moral agent God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="182" display="3:02" %}} - perfect character will never be less than the highest the best and the purest that the human mind can comprehend um to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="188" display="3:08" %}} - the nth degree and so just as God's nature is infinite so too is his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="193" display="3:13" %}} - character uh unimpeachable he is perfect in the superlative sense of every  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="199" display="3:19" %}} - positive moral characteristic and that is what we are going to be examining as we move forward uh talking about some of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="206" display="3:26" %}} - his characteristics of of goodness uh wow I'm forgetting them off the top of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="212" display="3:32" %}} - my head of goodness and then his Justice faithfulness and Truth moving into the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="217" display="3:37" %}} - applied characteristics as well so a do you have anything you want to say just about the idea of perfection in general  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="224" display="3:44" %}} - as it applies to God um I would say uh as a sort of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="232" display="3:52" %}} - contextualization uh of of this discussion so far it is this um that uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="240" display="4:00" %}} - uh in in discussing theology we're asking the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="245" display="4:05" %}} - question why should we trust  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="250" display="4:10" %}} - God that is um that is that is a okay let me see if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="257" display="4:17" %}} - I can get into it just a little bit hopefully you won't see the minute um the subject of the Bible is really God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="264" display="4:24" %}} - and his plan which of course is centered around the Lord Jesus Christ so so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="271" display="4:31" %}} - what we are seeking to do is to is to get to know why we we are right to place  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="279" display="4:39" %}} - our trust in God at least the one that's revealed in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="284" display="4:44" %}} - Bible and why that one is the right God because just like Paul says there are gods and Lords many but we know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="292" display="4:52" %}} - there is only one God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ so when we are looking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="300" display="5:00" %}} - at um theology the study of God we're looking at who first of all what is he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="307" display="5:07" %}} - and in fact those two components what is he and who is he are really um two parts  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="316" display="5:16" %}} - of one whole what is a thing made of and what does a thing do so what is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="323" display="5:23" %}} - nature what what is he at his core and what does he do as a rule these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="333" display="5:33" %}} - are the two things that tell us what a thing is and who who a person is so when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="340" display="5:40" %}} - we studied God is unique we were learning how he is deity how he is that which is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="350" display="5:50" %}} - thing that separate from everything else that exists now when we're looking at his character we're coming to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="357" display="5:57" %}} - see this is also why he does different things than every  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="363" display="6:03" %}} - everything else that exists so we discovering God as a person in his own  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="370" display="6:10" %}} - right and his Perfection is a necessary part of that discussion because it tells  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="375" display="6:15" %}} - us this is why we can trust him we know his abilities now we know his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="385" display="6:25" %}} - character so that's um that's what I would say about that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="390" display="6:30" %}} - it's a it's it's a question of keeping our eyes on what on what the context is what we're trying to uh um get to know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="399" display="6:39" %}} - so that we are confirmed in trusting the Lord as we come to discover what his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="406" display="6:46" %}} - plan is and are plac in that plan right and I think that's why the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="411" display="6:51" %}} - focus on this section um as the study mentions is Illuminating God's motives  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="417" display="6:57" %}} - why does God operate in the way which he does and what is the reason behind it um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="423" display="7:03" %}} - you know what are his plans as it regards us as moral creatures in the universe um so again not so much what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="431" display="7:11" %}} - can he do because as we've established God can do anything within material creation but why God does the things he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="439" display="7:19" %}} - does especially as we'll see in coming slides here as we go through this lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="445" display="7:25" %}} - especially as it relates to redeeming mankind um God's relationship to us as Humanity the ways in which he has saved  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="452" display="7:32" %}} - us from the just consequences of our sins through the sacrifice of his son on the cross um that is what we get at it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="460" display="7:40" %}} - when we talk about well why does God do what he does um what is his plan for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="465" display="7:45" %}} - Redemptive human history of mankind um so we will elaborate on all of this more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="471" display="7:51" %}} - as we go but for the first several slides we will be focusing on um God's essential characteristics of goodness  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="478" display="7:58" %}} - holy Hess and faithfulness and truth so I misspoke early it was Holiness not justice justice is the applied one but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="484" display="8:04" %}} - that is where we will pick up to begin this discussion in this lesson all right so we had a question here about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="492" display="8:12" %}} - basically why does this verse in Matthew Chapter 5 tell us to be perfect like god  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="497" display="8:17" %}} - is perfect if we have absolutely no ability to live up to that standard um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="503" display="8:23" %}} - we cannot be perfect in the same way that God is right we said God is unique in his abilities he's also unique in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="510" display="8:30" %}} - moral perfection uh so I always view this as a standard um so we are supposed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="516" display="8:36" %}} - to be dead to sin as Christians that doesn't mean that we are completely free from the grip of sin um so when we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="524" display="8:44" %}} - uh when the Bible says that we are to be perfect this is what our goal should be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="530" display="8:50" %}} - um we shouldn't make excuses for oursel we should not try to draw a line in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="535" display="8:55" %}} - sand and say uh you know no further God this is as far as I will go this is as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="540" display="9:00" %}} - much as I'm willing to sacrifice but we need to press forward towards the standard that is complete Perfection  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="546" display="9:06" %}} - because that is what God is um that is what we should strive to be um so um I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="554" display="9:14" %}} - don't see a contradiction inherently in that being the standard that's set for us even though we'll never meet it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="560" display="9:20" %}} - because God knows that that's why he sent his only son to die for us to make up that distance between us um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="567" display="9:27" %}} - distance that just to be clear is there inherently we could not even if we were  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="572" display="9:32" %}} - perfect which no human being can be because of the sin nature um uh this gets into a false Doctrine called  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="579" display="9:39" %}} - pelagianism uh even one of us you know were we to quote unquote live a perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="584" display="9:44" %}} - life which is impossible we still have this distance between us and God a do you want to uh clarify this verse at all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="593" display="9:53" %}} - if you were talking you muted can you hear me yeah I can hear you now  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="600" display="10:00" %}} - okay um I don't know if if it's just a network issues on my end you keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="607" display="10:07" %}} - breaking up um but if you can hear me let me say this like you said and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="614" display="10:14" %}} - another way that Prof Robert actually puts this matter of Matthew 5:48 is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="621" display="10:21" %}} - um it's a job description so it's like this is what you should be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="626" display="10:26" %}} - doing and if you're not doing it right then you try to do it better you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="631" display="10:31" %}} - it's your job description it it doesn't mean that we could possibly be that perfect uh Perfection is a gift that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="639" display="10:39" %}} - Lord is going to give to us but our responsibility is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="646" display="10:46" %}} - to push toward it so it's like working out just how the scripture say work out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="651" display="10:51" %}} - your salvation with fear and trembling so we are we we we are like him in in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="659" display="10:59" %}} - the sense since we have been born again we have the seed of God in us we are his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="668" display="11:08" %}} - children carrying his DNA so to speak so we should act like it is what this place  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="674" display="11:14" %}} - is saying so we're not supposed to um think in terms of first of all that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="680" display="11:20" %}} - can be be that perfect by our efforts no that's not what it's saying at all and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="687" display="11:27" %}} - second of all that um we are somehow because there are people who hold that view too we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="694" display="11:34" %}} - perfect simply because we are children of God no we will be made perfect we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="700" display="11:40" %}} - looking forward to that but the lord requires us to live like people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="707" display="11:47" %}} - aiming to be perfect so um in other words as long as we are not perfect we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="714" display="11:54" %}} - have work to do that's it that's the way we should be thinking about our lives um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="719" display="11:59" %}} - then regarding Noah exactly as uh Lisa said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="728" display="12:08" %}} - um that was that was speaking to his Humanity he was not an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="735" display="12:15" %}} - Neel he was perfect a perfect human being like a true human being not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="741" display="12:21" %}} - tainted in any way by the uh manipulations and uh what not of um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="750" display="12:30" %}} - uh the rebel Angels at the time that's what that was speaking to it wasn't speaking to his character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="757" display="12:37" %}} - or well yeah it wasn't speaking to his character where it spoke to his character was where it said that um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="763" display="12:43" %}} - was upright or something of that sort I don't remember the exact phrase used um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="770" display="12:50" %}} - so uh that was speaking to his Humanity we have evidence of the fact that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="776" display="12:56" %}} - certainly was not perfect in character with the wine thing you know of course  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="781" display="13:01" %}} - not that he was a drunk but then we should remember that Perfection is not that you do everything right when you're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="787" display="13:07" %}} - cognizant of it it is that even when you're not cognizant of it you're doing the right thing so you can't be wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="796" display="13:16" %}} - you can't do the wrong thing unconscious of that the Perfection of Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - is how that was the Perfection of God is like is how that was so the fact that you didn't know that something was wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="808" display="13:28" %}} - does not absolve you of guilt so likewise the fact that he did not know that he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="816" display="13:36" %}} - about to get drunk when he planted a vineard and you know made juice from it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="822" display="13:42" %}} - and and had the juice and didn't know it was going to do all of that to him his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="828" display="13:48" %}} - only proof that he was just like us like every other human being flawed in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="835" display="13:55" %}} - character because he was flawed in his knowledge so um I just it wasn't speaking this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="841" display="14:01" %}} - character not that we want to get too caught up in the grammar and things this is the Hebrew here my Hebrew is a lot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="847" display="14:07" %}} - rer than my Greek is um I did have a year of it in college but my Greek was much better because I had four years of that um so we have a prepositional  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="854" display="14:14" %}} - phrase here um this is this word here in Hebrew Hebrew is read right to left of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="859" display="14:19" %}} - course so uh this is a masculine plural form uh that means over here if you want  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="864" display="14:24" %}} - to look at the Lexicon uh I think you could get away translating either of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="870" display="14:30" %}} - like sort of times he was a man perfect in his times or his Generations um that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="876" display="14:36" %}} - KJV is quite literal um over here we see that KJV and KJV translate this as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="882" display="14:42" %}} - perfect in his generations and like aie has been clarifying this is with regards  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="887" display="14:47" %}} - to the fact that he was uh not of one of the Bloodlines of the Nephilim um he had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="895" display="14:55" %}} - uh he and his forefathers you know to be fair it's not just him had kept themselves uh set apart and pure in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="903" display="15:03" %}} - corruption that was racing through the world at his time and that is more or less what we should take this uh to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - what the text is getting at blameless or perfect in his Generations is getting at that sense not that Noah was an immoral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="918" display="15:18" %}} - person but that it wasn't drawing some sort of distinction between his perfect morality versus US normal humans but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="925" display="15:25" %}} - that it was specifically getting towards that um I don't know if that helps at all or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - just makes it more confusing but uh anything to add there Audi or is that how we can close off these questions oh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="939" display="15:39" %}} - no I think uh that's that's the wrap on that I think we can move on to the discussion now okay great well we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="946" display="15:46" %}} - pick up then um moving on towards those characteristics like we said we're gonna do the first time picking up with God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="956" display="15:56" %}} - good so on the first first of these characteristics of God describing his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="961" display="16:01" %}} - perfect character we're going to be talking about how God is good now before I pick up here I'm going to note that uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="968" display="16:08" %}} - Dr lugan buil in the study since these paragraphs are coming out of the study has a few key vocabulary words that will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - keep coming back up so we talked about goodness Holiness faithful and true  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="979" display="16:19" %}} - right those are essential characteristics of God part of his perfect character that will come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="984" display="16:24" %}} - manifest in creation um as love Justice and let me see love Justice and life um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - and alongside those things we know that um the kind of mindset that God has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1000" display="16:40" %}} - towards us corresponding to his goodness is Grace corresponding to his Justice is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1006" display="16:46" %}} - Mercy and corresponding to his life the life that he has through reconcil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1011" display="16:51" %}} - reconciling us to him is peace and so uh before we get too far ahead of ourselves  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1017" display="16:57" %}} - I do have a table uh that we'll get through partway through this lesson that kind of maps all this out to kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1022" display="17:02" %}} - help keep it straight but you'll notice that certain words here are kind of bolded or sorry uh italicized uh in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1029" display="17:09" %}} - text of these and this again is done so on the study itself uh you know I just made the slides pulling from the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1035" display="17:15" %}} - and that's because Dr Lil is trying to get us to follow these patterns um of how these words relate to each other uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1042" display="17:22" %}} - as as to how they relate towards uh God's character and his uh sort of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1049" display="17:29" %}} - um attitude towards us as sinful humanity and so uh starting out here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - I know that was a bit of a a rambly introduction uh here specifically we're talking about how God is good and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1061" display="17:41" %}} - Hebrew word for good is Tove here Tove and it is the antithesis of evil um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1067" display="17:47" %}} - I'm GNA go ahead and just read this paragraph um uh this part of the study I will say has almost a very poetic bent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1073" display="17:53" %}} - to it I think part of that is just Dr Lille has taken care to arrange the paragraph  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1079" display="17:59" %}} - so such that they're very parallel to each other um so they they share a similar sentence structure in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1085" display="18:05" %}} - how he organizes the terms and the concepts and you'll certainly see that when we get to uh the summary section of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1091" display="18:11" %}} - this there's a uh a grouping of how he he words it that really comes off very poetic um but in these paragraphs even  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1098" display="18:18" %}} - here you'll get this sense of The Wider scale behind the characteristics of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1104" display="18:24" %}} - that we're talking about um and this is why I kind of made the point that we're specifically looking at God's character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1110" display="18:30" %}} - to help illuminate why he takes the actions he does with respect to us as Humanity um God's attitude towards us as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1116" display="18:36" %}} - sinful man um so I'm gonna go ahead and I will probably just read these uh as the way as we go through again uh keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1123" display="18:43" %}} - in mind that the italicized words we will link those back up as important vocabulary here um as we make sense of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1131" display="18:51" %}} - the sovereignty of God and how he uh acts in the universe but going to go ahead and read this paragraph here so so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1138" display="18:58" %}} - it says so how does goodness respond to sinful man in his goodness God always  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1144" display="19:04" %}} - has our best interests his heart therefore his desire for us to be free from Evil and devoted to good is genuine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1152" display="19:12" %}} - even though we are sinful and by Nature Unworthy of his Blessing in his goodness God has nevertheless found a gracious  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1158" display="19:18" %}} - way to redeem us from sin without compromising his character namely by giving us the gift of his son Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1166" display="19:26" %}} - Christ now as we go and we look at the other characteristics of God you'll keep seeing uh kind of this closing remark  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1174" display="19:34" %}} - come up over and over again God has resolved all of the sort of uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1182" display="19:42" %}} - manifestations of his character what his character demands of him in terms of love and Justice uh through the cross of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1188" display="19:48" %}} - Jesus Christ it was the move that the devil never saw coming uh the the move  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1193" display="19:53" %}} - that completely won the game in a victory that cannot be turned back so Jesus Christ defeated sin and death once  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1200" display="20:00" %}} - for all on the cross I mean it is the central turning point of human history where God won the battle not that there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1207" display="20:07" %}} - was any chance that he would ever lose but it was the action that God took that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1213" display="20:13" %}} - completely changed everything uh for his relationship with humankind and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1219" display="20:19" %}} - is how uh you know for this slide specifically that is how we are seeing God's goodness uh this action that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1226" display="20:26" %}} - took on our behalf a gracious way to redeem us but as you'll see um as I've kind of been harping on here this will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1232" display="20:32" %}} - come up over and over again the cross is the action uh through which we can see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1237" display="20:37" %}} - God's character working in his plan to redeem Humanity so opening this discussion aie  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1244" display="20:44" %}} - do you have more things you want to say on the goodness of God I I just thought of uh James one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1252" display="20:52" %}} - where it said God is light and um uh there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1259" display="20:59" %}} - no not there is no shadow of turning with him I think there's um there's no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1264" display="21:04" %}} - Darkness at all in him so I think that uh that is one of the things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1270" display="21:10" %}} - Professor Robert is trying is is looking to get at with that section um so I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - will say also that um yeah let me see if if I will find that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1283" display="21:23" %}} - is I think it's earlier in the chapter yes okay there there is no shifting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1290" display="21:30" %}} - Shadow mhm okay with him there is no shifting Shadow but there's another place where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1295" display="21:35" %}} - it says God is light and uh you might be thinking of John the Gospel of John is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1301" display="21:41" %}} - that possible oh yeah you're right first John one right or first  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1307" display="21:47" %}} - John John the Gospel of John chapter one talks about how the light came into the world I think I know what you're talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1312" display="21:52" %}} - about have to I'll have to look for the passage um I was thinking it was James chapter one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1319" display="21:59" %}} - um God is light and uh there is no Darkness at all in him is first John it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1325" display="22:05" %}} - is first John one picking up at verse five yeah yeah correct so in him there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1331" display="22:11" %}} - is no Darkness at all so I think I see where Professor Robert is going or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1337" display="22:17" %}} - looking to you know get to with uh what he's saying there but every time that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1346" display="22:26" %}} - I've thought of discussing um the character of God I find  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1351" display="22:31" %}} - myself uh wanting to speak from the perspective that God is love and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1357" display="22:37" %}} - unfolding the characteristics of love you know um first uh 1 Corinthians 13  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1364" display="22:44" %}} - where it says Love Is This Love is that and all of that because I I feel like um in exploring  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1371" display="22:51" %}} - that we will come to probably when I say Fuller appreciation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1378" display="22:58" %}} - of what Professor Robert is trying to say there uh I I think um Lisa captured  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - it correctly when she said that um theology is a bit dense because it it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1390" display="23:10" %}} - packs so much into so uh little really and if you come at God's character from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1399" display="23:19" %}} - from the fact that he is love a lot of things will begin get to unfold I will say we will we will get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1405" display="23:25" %}} - there um that is one of the the applied goodness in creation um yeah it is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1411" display="23:31" %}} - slide in this lesson but uh it is five or six in the future at this point yeah I the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1419" display="23:39" %}} - uh how he structured it basically is what I would change is what I'm saying I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1425" display="23:45" %}} - find myself wanting to do that but I've not explored it as fully as I want to yet suffice to say that when he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1432" display="23:52" %}} - talking about God's goodness and talking about the antithesis the fact that it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1437" display="23:57" %}} - the antithesis of evil um this this uh uh reading in 1 John 1 um is very very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1448" display="24:08" %}} - much what it reminds me of the idea that we're still we're still saying this that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1455" display="24:15" %}} - God is different than um Satan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1461" display="24:21" %}} - than I wouldn't say just the universe because he made the universe to be good and then it got corrupted because of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1467" display="24:27" %}} - reion of Satan and uh all other creatures that agreed to um join him in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1473" display="24:33" %}} - his Rebellion but the idea here is God is not just good in that um he he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1485" display="24:45" %}} - is not evil he is good in the sense that he cannot be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1491" display="24:51" %}} - evil that he is good so that you define good by him and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1500" display="25:00" %}} - everything that is not him everything that does not derive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1505" display="25:05" %}} - from him is evil so something of that sort is what we're looking at when when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1511" display="25:11" %}} - when um Professor Robert matches good and evil in this way that he actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1517" display="25:17" %}} - says God God is good and he says it is that is the antithesis of evil he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1524" display="25:24" %}} - saying that there is no way to find evil in God which is something that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1529" display="25:29" %}} - speaking to the satanic Rebellion when Satan imputed God's character with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1536" display="25:36" %}} - accusations he made and he did the same thing with Adam and Eve when he said you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1542" display="25:42" %}} - will not surely die God is just trying to prevent you from becoming like him he's trying to keep something from you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1549" display="25:49" %}} - he wants it all for himself so to speak now this is essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1556" display="25:56" %}} - attacking God's character and saying it is not what it is but God cannot be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1562" display="26:02" %}} - corrupted at all in any way he it's impossible to corrupt him is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1568" display="26:08" %}} - the idea of his being the antithesis of evil it is not possible at any point to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1575" display="26:15" %}} - find evil in God so when when that question has arisen in in apologetics um is something  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1583" display="26:23" %}} - good because God decreed it or did God decree something because it is good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1588" display="26:28" %}} - the answer to that really is if God says it or if God does it then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1596" display="26:36" %}} - it is good that's it yeah well because this to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1601" display="26:41" %}} - me he is all good I I think it's another one of those things where we what Audi  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1607" display="26:47" %}} - is is getting into is one of those apologetics questions um I is this not ether froze dilemma is that what it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1614" display="26:54" %}} - called um I think you hard named youth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1619" display="26:59" %}} - fro am I right or right yeah look at that um well we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1627" display="27:07" %}} - don't need to get into this I I've heard this before um you know is uh whatever um it looks like it came  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1635" display="27:15" %}} - up initially with Socrates or you know Socrates via Plato um but the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1640" display="27:20" %}} - point is uh God is UN Alena good right good by definition uh the metric upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1647" display="27:27" %}} - which evil is defined comes through God's goodness um so for us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1653" display="27:33" %}} - practice uh this is another one of those things where uh sometimes we might be tempted to put God in a box again and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1660" display="27:40" %}} - say well how can we say God is good when there is suffering in the world or given  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1666" display="27:46" %}} - this this kind of very obviously horrific thing on the face of it well how can we have a good loving God you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1673" display="27:53" %}} - know and we'll get into this more as we unpack uh other aspects of God's charactera character but how can we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1679" display="27:59" %}} - believe that if this happens um that is a very common doubt um that people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1686" display="28:06" %}} - when it comes to the character of God um I don't see the purpose in this suffering or in this evil in the world  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1693" display="28:13" %}} - um and so how can we say God is good you know that is the sort of challenge that comes up but it it kind of we are once  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1701" display="28:21" %}} - again when we do that we aren't appreciating how big God is and how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1706" display="28:26" %}} - small our own perspective is in this um you know it's sort of like uh a a child  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1711" display="28:31" %}} - will say that um you know letting them eat lots of candy is good right it makes them happy but we know as adults that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1719" display="28:39" %}} - the thing that comes after eating an entire bag full of candies and upset stomach um that is the sort of shift in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1726" display="28:46" %}} - perspective that I'm getting at here um so we could very easily get off topic of talking about a whole bunch of aspects  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1733" display="28:53" %}} - of of all of this but you know I think as we go we will continue to clarify more about some of the aspects of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1740" display="29:00" %}} - character um and how we have to keep that perspective always in our heads about how much bigger God is than our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - own perspective um and some of that just involves the faith on our part to trust  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1752" display="29:12" %}} - that even at the times when we don't understand our default position needs to be to trust in God's character rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1759" display="29:19" %}} - than doubting it or feeling that it can't possibly be so um because no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1765" display="29:25" %}} - matter what sometimes we may be pressured to feel by our emotions leading us astray we need to have that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1771" display="29:31" %}} - sure confidence that God's character is perfect uh the Bible tells us so right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1776" display="29:36" %}} - right here Matthew 548 what we talked about and if the Bible tells us that then we need to trust that even when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1782" display="29:42" %}} - have a hard time understanding it um that could be a tricky lesson for us but that is certainly the standard to which we are called so I think that's where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1790" display="29:50" %}} - we'll wrap our initial discussion here on God being good and we will pick up next with God being holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1800" display="30:00" %}} - all right so the next aspect of God's perfect character that we are going to be discussing is God's holiness and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - just as before Dr Lugo gives us the Hebrew word here uh Holiness here is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1813" display="30:13" %}} - kados um again Hebrew readed right to left um so when we say God is Holy he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1819" display="30:19" %}} - completely separate from Evil he set apart so what this Hebrew word means the Greek word equivalent is hos I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1827" display="30:27" %}} - have that up on the oops I don't have that up on the screen here but uh equivalent word in Greek as well and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1833" display="30:33" %}} - holiness means being completely set apart and separate from Evil so again I said I was going to be reading these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1838" display="30:38" %}} - paragraphs getting that kind of poetic tilt to it and again notice the italicized word here here being merciful  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1845" display="30:45" %}} - and that's what corresponds to God's holiness So reading this paragraph we say so how does holiness respond to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1852" display="30:52" %}} - sinful man in his Holiness God can never compromise his perfect standard for any  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1857" display="30:57" %}} - reason therefore his commitment to condemning evil and rewarding good is inviolable but even though we are sinful  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1864" display="31:04" %}} - and by Nature deserving of his judgment in his Holiness God has nevertheless found a merciful way to justify us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1871" display="31:11" %}} - spite of our sin without violating his character namely by judging his son Jesus Christ in our place so I said that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1880" display="31:20" %}} - this uh ending refrain was going to come up time and again that the solution to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1885" display="31:25" %}} - all of these apparent contradictions how God relates to sinful man are solved uh through the cross through his Judgment  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1892" display="31:32" %}} - of his son Jesus Christ to take the place uh for the uh payment of our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1898" display="31:38" %}} - um and so this uh with regards to his Holiness God could not let sin go unpunished but in his Mercy Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1906" display="31:46" %}} - stood in the gap between us and he took the punishment on our behalf on that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1912" display="31:52" %}} - Mercy uh satisfying the Holiness that's part of God's character um also his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1918" display="31:58" %}} - goodness um his love for us so um do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1923" display="32:03" %}} - have thoughts you want to say on Holiness yeah sure  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1928" display="32:08" %}} - um so when I don't know if anyone else has thought about this but the feeling I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1935" display="32:15" %}} - had um the first time that I was going through Bible basics and I came to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1941" display="32:21" %}} - is good and then God is Holy was I'm not sure I see the difference I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1947" display="32:27" %}} - God is good God is Holy and then you go on to say first of all the the statement  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1954" display="32:34" %}} - he made with God is good is um it is the God's character is good it is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1960" display="32:40" %}} - antithesis of evil and then he says God's character is Holy it is completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1967" display="32:47" %}} - separate from Evil so it's like I mean didn't you just say the same thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1973" display="32:53" %}} - in two different ways right so why why do you need to talk about God's holiness  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1978" display="32:58" %}} - as a separate thing from God's goodness in the first instance we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1983" display="33:03" %}} - talking about how nothing that is evil comes from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1990" display="33:10" %}} - at all like this evil by by very by by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="1996" display="33:16" %}} - its very definition is an opposition to God so God cannot do evil there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2003" display="33:23" %}} - possibility that if anything is evil it has its roots or origins in God this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2009" display="33:29" %}} - very important in our walk with the Lord because I mean when you get to a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2016" display="33:36" %}} - certain stage and not too far into your walk with the Lord you do you do start to see that it makes no sense to ascribe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2024" display="33:44" %}} - certain things to the Lord because they simply can't be him he simply can't be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2030" display="33:50" %}} - like that um but Holiness is that there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2037" display="33:57" %}} - subtle difference here and the subtle difference is not just that nothing evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2042" display="34:02" %}} - can come from the Lord but that if it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2050" display="34:10" %}} - evil it has nothing to do with God so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2055" display="34:15" %}} - it's not just that it does not come from him but he is utterly separated from it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2062" display="34:22" %}} - and the separation is not is not a small one it's a wide  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2068" display="34:28" %}} - golf so when you see  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2073" display="34:33" %}} - goodness or something that looks good but does not derive from God and it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2080" display="34:40" %}} - actually evil the better you know the Lord the easier it is for you to tell that that thing is not it has nothing to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2087" display="34:47" %}} - do with god so let's talk about that in job it says that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2093" display="34:53" %}} - he he found fault with his holy ones now that's a very big  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2101" display="35:01" %}} - statement to make because Satan was so smart that it felt like his evil looked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2107" display="35:07" %}} - like good he could get away with what he was doing because God couldn't condemn it but God still found fault with it and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2115" display="35:15" %}} - a lot of times in our own minds this is how sin actually seduces us we come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2121" display="35:21" %}} - think that we can we can understand a certain thing as being well not so bad  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2127" display="35:27" %}} - or well even good it's we don't have a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2134" display="35:34" %}} - problem as we are right now people who have been training in the scriptures for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2140" display="35:40" %}} - so long now in in Discerning that certain things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2147" display="35:47" %}} - are just not God we don't have a problem Discerning  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2153" display="35:53" %}} - that but look at the world around us there are those who are you might think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2160" display="36:00" %}} - of them as being mischievous when they say certain  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2166" display="36:06" %}} - things but you you you might not actually see that they really do believe the things they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2172" display="36:12" %}} - saying some people really do believe that one of the most popular  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2178" display="36:18" %}} - issues in the world today the LGBT thing is approved by God and they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2184" display="36:24" %}} - intricate involved arguments to persuade themselves and other people that this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2191" display="36:31" %}} - not really separate from God's holy standard they they find it in consonance  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2198" display="36:38" %}} - with God himself and yet there's a wide Gulf that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2204" display="36:44" %}} - cannot be bridged between where they stand and where God is and the reason they can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2212" display="36:52" %}} - see that is because they don't know God's character to be holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2218" display="36:58" %}} - okay so that's one aspect of it that there is this massive separation between God and all that is evil the other thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2225" display="37:05" %}} - about it too is because God is Holy there is no reconciliation between God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2232" display="37:12" %}} - and all that is evil so as we said with his goodness everything that is evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2237" display="37:17" %}} - stands in opposition to who God is and what God is about everything that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2242" display="37:22" %}} - does stands in opposition to all that is evil now we see that everything that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2249" display="37:29" %}} - does or is about is separate like it you cannot find it in any agreement with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2256" display="37:36" %}} - things that are evil okay now this also means that every time there is evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2264" display="37:44" %}} - being done it there is a condemnation already a Divine condemnation on that thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2272" display="37:52" %}} - there is no possibility of reconciling it to God this is also why um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2278" display="37:58" %}} - those well in Psalm it actually says evil shall not dwell with God there is no possibility of God coexisting with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2286" display="38:06" %}} - that so that might raise a question for us which we have actually touched on uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2292" display="38:12" %}} - in our discussions at some point how then does God interact with the world filled as it is with evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2300" display="38:20" %}} - there's such a separation between him and evil that there cannot be any  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2306" display="38:26" %}} - reconciliation right up to the point that even before evil existed there was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2312" display="38:32" %}} - something there was a need for a cherub that covered a cherub that made a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2318" display="38:38" %}} - difference between who God is and what God is about and all that is not what God is about and even after the fall  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2326" display="38:46" %}} - after Satan's rebellion and after uh well after after Satan's Rebellion after  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2332" display="38:52" %}} - man's fall we still see that there was a cherub or cherubim now that guarded the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2339" display="38:59" %}} - way to God and said essentially now that you are stained you cannot come close to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2344" display="39:04" %}} - me so how then is God operating in an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2349" display="39:09" %}} - evil world today so this this is a question we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2356" display="39:16" %}} - explore a little bit but we get we get a clue in what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2361" display="39:21" %}} - um Roberts says when he says in his Holiness God has nevertheless found a merciful way to justify us now if you go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2369" display="39:29" %}} - to First John again chapter one it says that he that he he is faithful and just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2375" display="39:35" %}} - to forgive us so there is Justice a righteousness a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2382" display="39:42" %}} - goodness in the Lord actually forgiving Sinners when remember again there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - reconciliation between God and anything that is evil so now we are getting a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2394" display="39:54" %}} - hint at a mass mive miracle in God that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2399" display="39:59" %}} - makes it possible for him to forgive sin us so again I will say that the way that Professor Robert actually structure this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2405" display="40:05" %}} - discussion of theology is to make this point of the miracle of Jesus Christ for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2411" display="40:11" %}} - us I would structure it differently but I but the point here is he's he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2416" display="40:16" %}} - driving at telling us Jesus is the point and Jesus is the miracle that would make  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2422" display="40:22" %}} - it possible for a God who is utterly holy completely sep from everything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2427" display="40:27" %}} - is evil to reconcile Sinners to himself that's the miracle sure I mean I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2434" display="40:34" %}} - I definitely pointed that out that is the theme that is continually cycled back to in how he structures these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2441" display="40:41" %}} - statements on God's character it's all about turning us back to see how the cross is the thing that reconciles all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2448" display="40:48" %}} - these aspects of God's character now I will say uh we probably don't need to spend too much more time talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2454" display="40:54" %}} - how can a holy God dwell among uh you know sin because we definitely spent time talking about that with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2460" display="41:00" %}} - regards to light and Glory that was a couple uh a couple lessons back at this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2465" display="41:05" %}} - point but um one other thing to mention AI kind of brought up this idea of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2470" display="41:10" %}} - well if God is the antithesis of evil and we say his Holiness means he's completely separate from Evil what's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2476" display="41:16" %}} - distinction um at risk of oversimplifying uh I think it would go something like God cannot sin because he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2483" display="41:23" %}} - is good but God cannot tolerate sin because he is Holy um so not so much his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2490" display="41:30" %}} - sin but the sin of other beings um Holiness has an intolerance for the sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2496" display="41:36" %}} - the presence of sin in a way that simply not sinning oneself is somewhat different um so that's how I view God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2503" display="41:43" %}} - holiness bril and that's also what ties us all the way back to like Audi said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2509" display="41:49" %}} - the cross of Jesus Christ being a miracle right how we reconcile God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2514" display="41:54" %}} - holiness with sinful creatures is nothing short of miraculous it is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2519" display="41:59" %}} - very thing that saves us uh that gives us our life here in the world is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2525" display="42:05" %}} - God condemned Jesus Christ in our place and we need to view that and again I certainly there are you know there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2531" display="42:11" %}} - almost an infinite uh degree of ways to structure things to go about talking about who God is what his character is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2538" display="42:18" %}} - but like Audi said the way in which this particular structure is structured this particular study is structured is trying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2545" display="42:25" %}} - to draw emphasis that uh the cross of Jesus Christ is what reconciles these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2551" display="42:31" %}} - aspects of God's character um so uh I don't have too much more to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2556" display="42:36" %}} - I think we have covered this one well um that is what makes Holiness um you know a distinct characteristic of God and I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2563" display="42:43" %}} - would say almost arguably the characteristic of God that poses the greatest challenge to us as sinful human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2569" display="42:49" %}} - beings right um you know yeah we we we have this huge Gulf like you've been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2575" display="42:55" %}} - saying between between us and God um this is the aspect of God's character that challenges our right to Salvation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2583" display="43:03" %}} - um and that's why the cross of Jesus Christ is such blessed good news for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2589" display="43:09" %}} - um that God is the one who bridged that Gulf through his son yeah all right well I think that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2596" display="43:16" %}} - where we will wrap on Holiness and next we will be picking up with how God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2601" display="43:21" %}} - faithful and true all right so picking up with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2608" display="43:28" %}} - next aspect of God's character God being faithful and true so we have two Hebrew  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2614" display="43:34" %}} - words here remember Hebrews right to left but this here is Omen and Emet  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2619" display="43:39" %}} - these are other fundamental aspects of God's character so God's character is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2625" display="43:45" %}} - faithful and true it is actively opposed to evil um so God cannot sin God cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - tolerate sin God actively opposes sin and evil um God being faithful and true  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - uh you know truth and lies um aie brought this up when uh he he brought up first John chapter 1 talking about light  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2644" display="44:04" %}} - and darkness uh good and evil light and darkness truth and lies these are all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2650" display="44:10" %}} - binary distinctions and God is uh good and light and Truth as opposed to evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2656" display="44:16" %}} - and darkness and lies um and so all of these are just ways in which we can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2662" display="44:22" %}} - conceptualize God's character and his relationship to the world so uh just as for the last two going to go ahead and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2668" display="44:28" %}} - read this paragraph and note again how it always turns back to thinking in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2673" display="44:33" %}} - terms of Jesus Christ and the cross as the solution to reconciling us to God um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2679" display="44:39" %}} - so this paragraph says so how do truth and faithfulness respond to sinful man  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2684" display="44:44" %}} - in his faithfulness and Truth God is entirely reliable and trustworthy in all that he promises to us and does for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2692" display="44:52" %}} - therefore his veracity and dependability in offering us a way through Jesus Jesus Christ to escape the evil of death and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2698" display="44:58" %}} - embrace the good of eternal life are Beyond reproach so even though we are sinful and by nature objects of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2705" display="45:05" %}} - wrath in his faithfulness and Truth God has nevertheless found a way to make peace between himself and us and to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2712" display="45:12" %}} - remove the enity between himself and US caused by our sins without corrupting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2717" display="45:17" %}} - his character namely by reconciling us to himself through the death of his son Jesus Christ so um God and and this kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2726" display="45:26" %}} - of gets also to what AI said last time uh 1 John chter 1:9 says that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2732" display="45:32" %}} - faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and all unrighteousness right um it's on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2738" display="45:38" %}} - basis of the blood of Christ that God can do that but he has promised us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2744" display="45:44" %}} - Redemption he promised Adam and Eve Redemption right after the fall Genesis chapter 3 um I can't remember if it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2751" display="45:51" %}} - verse 15 I think it's verse 17 let me see how good my memory is the Proto evangelium  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2757" display="45:57" %}} - um no yeah no okay not 17 my memory is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2763" display="46:03" %}} - that great definitely Genesis chapter 3 though after the curse probably it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2769" display="46:09" %}} - it's 21 it's 21 um and the Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2774" display="46:14" %}} - and clothes and this so-called Proto evangelium the First Gospel that we have here God promises Adam and Eve  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2781" display="46:21" %}} - Redemption salvation right the shedding of blood for the Forgiveness of sins as symbolized by the animals um you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2788" display="46:28" %}} - this uh the the blood sacrifice necessary to fulfill his justice as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2794" display="46:34" %}} - we'll get to his applied Holiness in creation but this is what we mean by God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2799" display="46:39" %}} - being faithful and true to forgive us of our sins and all un righteousness is that through Jesus Christ God is Not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2805" display="46:45" %}} - only able to but it is just it is uh you know according to his faithfulness and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2811" display="46:51" %}} - truth that he can forgive us of our sins because Jesus Christ has TR truly paid for it all um and again this is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2818" display="46:58" %}} - where we get a sense of the scale of the Cross of what it represents as the solution to our problems as Humanity to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2825" display="47:05" %}} - the sin and death problem to our that yawning Chasm between us and God is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2832" display="47:12" %}} - God has actually done so much already in sending his son to die for us that it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2839" display="47:19" %}} - the right thing to do to forgive us it is in line with his character it is in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2845" display="47:25" %}} - line with truth to forgive us of our sins because Jesus Christ paid for them that should blow our minds a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2852" display="47:32" %}} - right because we know that we sin every day and yet the Bible tells us that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2858" display="47:38" %}} - is just in forgiving us on the basis of his cross it is in character with you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2863" display="47:43" %}} - know him being the god of Truth to forgive us of our sins um that blows my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2869" display="47:49" %}} - mind um so are there things you want to say on these aspects of God's character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2875" display="47:55" %}} - Audi yeah I I really like the way you're putting it I think it's very simple and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2881" display="48:01" %}} - very succinct um I I want to stretch the bit the faithful and true thing is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2889" display="48:09" %}} - specifically addressing the satanic Rebellion so uh like I said the approach  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2896" display="48:16" %}} - that I would have taken or that I still want to explore for myself is more from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2903" display="48:23" %}} - you know God's character independent of the satanic Rebellion but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2908" display="48:28" %}} - this is in the context of our experience as sinful creatures who need Redemption and all of that which is very critical  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2916" display="48:36" %}} - because the Cross of Christ is really the whole point okay so when he speaks  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2922" display="48:42" %}} - to faithful and true this is actually a challenge to the satanic Rebellion which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2928" display="48:48" %}} - essentially said God is Not faithful and he is not true he clearly is keeping  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2934" display="48:54" %}} - things from us things that are good for us he doesn't want any competition so he's keeping the best things for himself  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2942" display="49:02" %}} - um so this this is what um Satan essentially did imping God's character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2949" display="49:09" %}} - and this this is the nature of sin so if anyone has a question what is sin sin is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2955" display="49:15" %}} - always imping God's character and seeking to take things from him that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2962" display="49:22" %}} - has not given because we believe we have a right to them and God is denying us of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2969" display="49:29" %}} - them so um when it speaks to faithful when we when we talk of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2976" display="49:36" %}} - character being faithful and true it is that he can be relied  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2984" display="49:44" %}} - on he can be trusted and this is critical to our walk  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2989" display="49:49" %}} - with the Lord especially in a world such as ours remembering again that the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="2994" display="49:54" %}} - point of sin is is that God cannot be relied on so in a world where we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3000" display="50:00" %}} - facing the pressures that essentially tell us why listen to him why don't you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3006" display="50:06" %}} - do what you what you want because after all you can't trust him to be seeking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3012" display="50:12" %}} - out what is best for you now the response of the Bible to that is he gave  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3017" display="50:17" %}} - his son for your sin and think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3023" display="50:23" %}} - it um when we take into account what you've just said Stephen how God delivered us through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3030" display="50:30" %}} - sacrifice of Jesus Christ it's amazing it's amazing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3037" display="50:37" %}} - how someone who cannot tolerate sin someone who has no truck with sin he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3044" display="50:44" %}} - himself cannot do anything evil and cannot tolerate it can still forgive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3051" display="50:51" %}} - people who do in order for him to forgive people who do he has to do something  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3059" display="50:59" %}} - incredible something that Satan could not have known about because there was no occasion for that thing to ever arise  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3065" display="51:05" %}} - that God would create a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3071" display="51:11" %}} - sacrifice in order to make it possible for the one who cannot tolerate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3077" display="51:17" %}} - evil to restore to friendship with himself people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3083" display="51:23" %}} - evil that's a tri if we have any question as to God's faithfulness and to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3089" display="51:29" %}} - his truth that is the answer to it and that's how we can get through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3094" display="51:34" %}} - hardships of this life and the tribulations that will come always thinking just like Paul said if he gave  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3101" display="51:41" %}} - us his son how will how how will he not together with him give us all things so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3108" display="51:48" %}} - that is the Touchstone of think think of this contrast you brought this up I think this is a good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - example uh contrast the Serpent's accusation imputing the character of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3119" display="51:59" %}} - you must not eat from any tree in the garden right up here with God's promise  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3125" display="52:05" %}} - of redemption right verse 21 yes God promises them salvation through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3130" display="52:10" %}} - animal skins Satan says God's not trustworthy why would God tell you you can't eat from that tree right he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3137" display="52:17" %}} - implies something with that that's not a neutral question that is a leading question saying yeah you know God doing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3145" display="52:25" %}} - this is in some way making him not looking out for your best for your ultimate good whereas in fact God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3152" display="52:32" %}} - promises Redemption and you have to just keep in mind think about the thousands of years in between Adam and Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3159" display="52:39" %}} - right 4,000 gber take right um and and when you think about that 4,000 years  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3167" display="52:47" %}} - was this promise there I mean you think about Abraham right we're talking about God's faithfulness and Truth God tells  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3173" display="52:53" %}} - Abraham he will have an heir and through that air you know the his descendants would be like the grains of sand upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3180" display="53:00" %}} - the beach shore right Abraham had to wait decades for that son of promise  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3187" display="53:07" %}} - right for the son of the Covenant and this idea that we have here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3192" display="53:12" %}} - of God demonstrating his faithfulness despite the odds how about Noah too while we're on the topic of waiting um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3199" display="53:19" %}} - what hundreds of years right Noah built the ark 120 Am I Wrong um I don't know I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3205" display="53:25" %}} - have to go look but decades upon decades Noah was trusting God and God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3211" display="53:31" %}} - was faithful right um but notice in all these instances people many people the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3218" display="53:38" %}} - world in fact says that God is not um Satan says God is not scoffers in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - world say God is Not faithful um and sometimes like Abraham and Sarah having  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3229" display="53:49" %}} - doubt sometimes we doubt it as well we doubt that God is really faithful um that he'll really come through for us us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3237" display="53:57" %}} - so you know just as with the other things if we doubt that God is good on account of evil well if we doubt that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3243" display="54:03" %}} - God is faithful because we haven't seen Deliverance up until this day like AI said just think about what that will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3249" display="54:09" %}} - mean uh when the tribulation comes Upon Us in the world if God has already given us his son while we were yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3256" display="54:16" %}} - sinners what are we afraid of you know why why don't we trust God a little bit more than we do um this is not to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3264" display="54:24" %}} - that this is easy stuff we're talking about here uh trusting that God is faithful and true even in the face of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3270" display="54:30" %}} - immense suffering that is no easy thing that takes you know an immense amount of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3276" display="54:36" %}} - spiritual growth and character to Bear up under those tests and trust that even when we don't see the point of Escape  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3283" display="54:43" %}} - that like 1 Corinthians 10:13 tells us um you know he will not test us past what we can bear but he will always  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3290" display="54:50" %}} - provide an out a way for us to uh never never be put pushed past what we can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3296" display="54:56" %}} - actually handle um so it all comes down to Faith um it all comes down to our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3301" display="55:01" %}} - trust in the character of God that when the Bible teaches that God is faithful and true and we can trust his promises  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3307" display="55:07" %}} - that we actually believe that um and uh you know this is um I'm trying to think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3314" display="55:14" %}} - about the best way to phrase it maybe one of those things where uh especially if you grew up in church you kind of know the church answer to this question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3320" display="55:20" %}} - uh yeah yeah God is good God is holy God is faithful  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3325" display="55:25" %}} - but if you believe that it changes how you live your life it changes your relationship and you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3332" display="55:32" %}} - don't doubt God because why would you doubt God if you actually believe that he was completely faithful um and so I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3338" display="55:38" %}} - this I'm saying this as a challenge to myself as a challenge to all of us as we think about this is that when we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3344" display="55:44" %}} - that we believe that God is good that God is Holy that God is faithful and true if we believe those things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3351" display="55:51" %}} - shouldn't it change how we act shouldn't it change how we view God in our heads um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3357" display="55:57" %}} - we should give him the benefit of the doubt every single time there's no instance in which we have just occasion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3365" display="56:05" %}} - to actually doubt god um so obviously kind of harping on the obvious here boy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3370" display="56:10" %}} - that was bit repetitious should say that what I'm saying should not be controversial we all know this but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3377" display="56:17" %}} - living it is a lot harder than just knowing it um so I won't ramble more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3383" display="56:23" %}} - there um very important concept for us here to trust God's faithfulness because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3389" display="56:29" %}} - he was faithful in delivering us from our sin as he promised how much more so will he not Del Deliver Us from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3394" display="56:34" %}} - everything else all the obstacles that come before us in life so uh I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3401" display="56:41" %}} - that's where we'll end this one and we will pick up in the next section talking about God's sovereignty um as it applies  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3408" display="56:48" %}} - to his moral rulership of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3413" display="56:53" %}} - universe so now we're going to talk kind of about the bridge section here in our study of God's character so just like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3420" display="57:00" %}} - when how we were studying God's infinite nature uh we kind of tied um God's essential characteristics to how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3427" display="57:07" %}} - manifest in creation uh through his uniqueness no one is like God in the universe we're going to do a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3434" display="57:14" %}} - similar thing here with respect to God's perfect character discussing how all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - how all of the characteristics that we've been talking about in terms of his goodness his Holiness his faithfulness and Truth manifest in the universe um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3447" display="57:27" %}} - and so we are going to in so doing that be talking about God's sovereignty um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3453" display="57:33" %}} - and so I'll read from the slide here a little bit we're going to go through several slides here in this one um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3458" display="57:38" %}} - talking about how all of these things kind of Link together and give us that uh that full picture of God's Redemptive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3465" display="57:45" %}} - plan for human history which as we've noted a couple times here has been the way that Dr Lil has structured um this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3472" display="57:52" %}} - study of God theology proper at least this initial section on God's nature and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3477" display="57:57" %}} - character so sovereignty um kind of a long word here sovereignty comes from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3483" display="58:03" %}} - God's perfect character so just how on account of his uniqueness we said that no one else God is Du all the honor and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3490" display="58:10" %}} - the glory because no one else is like him in the universe well no one else has a legitimate right to rule over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3496" display="58:16" %}} - universe and that's what we mean by God being Sovereign he is the absolute Sovereign within his own creation and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3502" display="58:22" %}} - therefore the one person to whom all honor is due sovereignty thus speaks to God's moral Authority and right to order  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3509" display="58:29" %}} - the universe however he chooses so if God is the defao ruler of the Universe on account of his abilities that no one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3517" display="58:37" %}} - uh no one else is omnipotent and omniscient and omnipresent well it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3522" display="58:42" %}} - because of his moral Authority that God is the deure ruler of the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3527" display="58:47" %}} - because no one else has the right to judge moral creatures in the way that God does from the standpoint of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3534" display="58:54" %}} - Transcendence of the moral Universe God is Sovereign by virtue of his goodness his Holiness and his truth essential  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3540" display="59:00" %}} - qualities independent of his creation those are the things we've just talked about and here's where we get the bridge  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3546" display="59:06" %}} - uh to the next things that we're going to be discussing so those were the things that were his essential qualities  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3552" display="59:12" %}} - independent of his creation but from the standpoint of his Supremacy within the moral Universe God is Sovereign by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3559" display="59:19" %}} - virtue of his love his Justice and life qualities applying to his creation which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3564" display="59:24" %}} - Corr respond to goodness Holiness and Truth um so this is very similar to how we had discussion in the first series  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3572" display="59:32" %}} - how these things were linked together except now we're talking about God's sovereignty his moral Authority and right to order the universe from a moral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3580" display="59:40" %}} - standpoint only God is qualified to be the ultimate judge of the morally accountable creatures he has created so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3587" display="59:47" %}} - that's us that's Angels creatures with Free Will and thus to hold them responsible for their actions as day  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3594" display="59:54" %}} - fact of the riverse the de facto ruler of the universe through his perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3599" display="59:59" %}} - nature and dejur ruler of the universe through his perfect character God can do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3605" display="1:00:05" %}} - these things and so that's the next several slides that we're going to talk about this is why I said all of this stuff all part of one cohesive whole so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3612" display="1:00:12" %}} - because God is the de facto and deur ruler of the universe through his perfect nature and his perfect character  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3618" display="1:00:18" %}} - God can God possesses The Sovereign authority to demonstrate love to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3623" display="1:00:23" %}} - sinful creatures out of his own goodness and so these slides are going to be showing you that relationship between  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3629" display="1:00:29" %}} - these essential qualities of God and these qualities working themselves out in creation so here we have um God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3637" display="1:00:37" %}} - demonstrating love out of his goodness next we're GNA have Justice coming from Holiness and after that life coming from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3643" display="1:00:43" %}} - truth and faithfulness but this first one God possesses The Sovereign authority to demonstrate love to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3649" display="1:00:49" %}} - sinful creatures out of his goodness not ignoring their sins as evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3655" display="1:00:55" %}} - suggests he should but paying for them himself by the death on the cross of his son Jesus Christ in their place this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3662" display="1:01:02" %}} - process what we just said there paying for the sins through the death of his son on the cross that's called  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3668" display="1:01:08" %}} - Redemption so we call the result of this act of his sovereignty Grace we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3673" display="1:01:13" %}} - saved by grace through faith that's commonly how you'll hear it uh Hebrew word for this word is so that's a a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3681" display="1:01:21" %}} - difficult character for us as English speakers to pronounce um and the Hebrew true word here is Cardis um starting  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3687" display="1:01:27" %}} - with a Kai um so Grace is the God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3692" display="1:01:32" %}} - attitude God's Sovereign attitude towards man as a demonstration of his goodness and his love for us next one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3700" display="1:01:40" %}} - God possesses you know again God being the de facto deur ruler of the Universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3706" display="1:01:46" %}} - um as the deao deur ruler of the universe God possesses The Sovereign authority to administer Justice to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3713" display="1:01:53" %}} - sinful creatures out of his Holiness so not abandoning them to their sins as evil suggests he must but forgiving them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3721" display="1:02:01" %}} - himself on the basis of the death on the cross of his son Jesus Christ in their place so uh before we said that paying  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3729" display="1:02:09" %}} - for our sins on the cross through the death of Christ was Redemption here we're saying that forgiving our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3736" display="1:02:16" %}} - based on the death of Christ on the cross is called justification um these are important words in terms of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3743" display="1:02:23" %}} - would call atonement theory in terms of this progression of how God Saves  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3748" display="1:02:28" %}} - mankind um so we call the result of this act of his sovereignty Mercy um again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3754" display="1:02:34" %}} - Hebrew word here and Greek is alos um important sort of technical theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3761" display="1:02:41" %}} - vocabulary all over the place here um God forgives us and that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3767" display="1:02:47" %}} - justification forgiving us on the basis of the blood of his son and God doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3773" display="1:02:53" %}} - have to forgive us that's what makes this Mercy is that in no way did God have to send his son to forgive us out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3778" display="1:02:58" %}} - of our sins uh to get us out of our sins he did that because of his Mercy right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3784" display="1:03:04" %}} - he paid for our sins uh as an act of Grace he forgives of forgives us of our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3789" display="1:03:09" %}} - sins as an act of mercy and that leads us to this third one that as de facto and de Jer a ruler of the universe God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3797" display="1:03:17" %}} - possesses The Sovereign authority to give life to his sinful creatures out of his truth and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3803" display="1:03:23" %}} - faithfulness not allowing his creatures to die in their sins as evil suggests he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3808" display="1:03:28" %}} - will but reconciling them to himself through the the death on the cross of his son Jesus Christ in their place this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3815" display="1:03:35" %}} - is what we call reconciliation we are reconciled to the father through the blood of Christ we call the result of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3822" display="1:03:42" %}} - this act of his sovereignty peace again Hebrew word and Greek word probably heard this one before Hebrew word is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3829" display="1:03:49" %}} - Shalom peace and the Greek word is a um and so these are all of these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3838" display="1:03:58" %}} - speak of God's Redemptive purpose in human history redeeming us to himself despite what evil says so if you compare  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3845" display="1:04:05" %}} - across um these three slides making all of these points in sequential order here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3850" display="1:04:10" %}} - evil suggests that God should ignore their sins but instead God paid for them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3856" display="1:04:16" %}} - evil suggests that God should abandon us to our sins but God forgave us instead  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3862" display="1:04:22" %}} - and evil suggests that God should allow us to die in our sins but instead God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3867" display="1:04:27" %}} - reconciled us to him um and so this is the powerful story of redemption that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3872" display="1:04:32" %}} - God has wrought throughout history this is why the cross of Jesus Christ was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3877" display="1:04:37" %}} - that winning move that we've been talking about in fact this is the very reason why human history is playing out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3883" display="1:04:43" %}} - as it is and that point that I just made is where a lot of Bible teaching on the subject they fail to make that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3889" display="1:04:49" %}} - connection they fail to realize that human history is a response resp to Satan's Rebellion that God has created  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3897" display="1:04:57" %}} - us in order to demonstrate that in fact sinful creatures can be reconciled to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3902" display="1:05:02" %}} - him despite what the angel said despite Satan's PR platform saying God wouldn't be able to do this that is exactly what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3909" display="1:05:09" %}} - God is doing and that is the reason why humans were created along with being created to demonstrate the glory of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3915" display="1:05:15" %}} - but you know that's sort of the the normal catechism answer but this is the wider meaning to human history all right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3923" display="1:05:23" %}} - so obious a lot to unpack there a lot to keep straight in our heads hence handy table right so we have been talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3930" display="1:05:30" %}} - about God's essential qualities manifesting in creation as certain things right so I've kind of titled this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3936" display="1:05:36" %}} - slide as God's sovereignty in action um lots of technical terms here so God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3942" display="1:05:42" %}} - goodness manifests in his creation as love for us and through that love for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3948" display="1:05:48" %}} - God has paid for human sin uh this is coming out of his sovereign attitude of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3955" display="1:05:55" %}} - Grace and results in our Redemption right so a lot there going to go ahead and go through this table and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3961" display="1:06:01" %}} - we may spend some time unpacking this as we go but God's essential quality of Holiness manifests in Creation in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3968" display="1:06:08" %}} - perfect Justice and the action God takes based on his Justice is Forgiven human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3973" display="1:06:13" %}} - sin um based on his attitude towards us of Mercy leading to our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3980" display="1:06:20" %}} - justification um so that is scratching out our sin in the legal record as it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3985" display="1:06:25" %}} - were that's what justification is as to his essential quality of Truth this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3991" display="1:06:31" %}} - manifests in creation through god-given life um the action God takes is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="3996" display="1:06:36" %}} - reconciling sinful man to himself out of his Sovereign attitude towards us of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4002" display="1:06:42" %}} - Peace resulting in our reconciliation with him so in all of these things you can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4008" display="1:06:48" %}} - see that God's full plan for saving sinful man absolutely everything in this plan relies upon the cross the blood of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4016" display="1:06:56" %}} - Jesus Christ um so I actually really like this way phrasing it I don't even remember where I came across this I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4021" display="1:07:01" %}} - think it was like when I was younger a kid maybe 10 12 um I've heard it phrased this way that God's mercy and Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4028" display="1:07:08" %}} - intersect in the cross right the cross is everything as it relates to saving  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4034" display="1:07:14" %}} - mankind out of our sins um so uh we may need to go through this a couple times I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4039" display="1:07:19" %}} - mean I sure had to uh make sure that I squinted at it and and got it all straight in the words in our head um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4047" display="1:07:27" %}} - you know obviously these things that we're talking about Redemption justification reconciliation um these are parts of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4053" display="1:07:33" %}} - that process that we go through as Christian and how we relate to God what God has done for us in a theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4059" display="1:07:39" %}} - sense so um all sorts of places where we could take this but I know I've talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4065" display="1:07:45" %}} - for a good few minutes here this is how we see God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4070" display="1:07:50" %}} - sovereignty uh play out in the universe God in sovereign in control of all events that happen but in particular we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4077" display="1:07:57" %}} - see God working uh for us for our Salvation uh through the sacrificing of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4083" display="1:08:03" %}} - his son Jesus Christ that we might be saved that we might be uh redeemed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4089" display="1:08:09" %}} - Justified um and reconciled to him not only now in time but also eternally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4095" display="1:08:15" %}} - forever more um so uh aie uh I'll turn it over to you um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4102" display="1:08:22" %}} - what do you want to say um about all of this that we've gone through is there anything that jumps out at you uh that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4107" display="1:08:27" %}} - we kind of haven't already covered here so um the satanic rebellion was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4113" display="1:08:33" %}} - challenge to God's right to rule that was what it was it was Satan  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4119" display="1:08:39" %}} - saying I get why why don't I get to be God too why don't I get to rule over  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4125" display="1:08:45" %}} - creation myself as well and um what Professor Robert presents is is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4131" display="1:08:51" %}} - argument for Why God has has the right to rule he says that that right is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4137" display="1:08:57" %}} - moral one and that it is rooted in God's character and he goes on to explain how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4143" display="1:09:03" %}} - God's how to argue how God's character qualifies him to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4148" display="1:09:08" %}} - rule so that is a very solid argument and it actually is just as you said and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4156" display="1:09:16" %}} - as exis continues to unfold um in all of its studies  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4161" display="1:09:21" %}} - that it it it is the point of human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4167" display="1:09:27" %}} - history human history is God's argument for his right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4174" display="1:09:34" %}} - rule in fact that is what First Corinthians 15 essentially says and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4180" display="1:09:40" %}} - comes the end when he will hand over the kingdom to the father so the idea here is in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4187" display="1:09:47" %}} - end all Rebellion is squashed all enemies are removed and God gets to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4193" display="1:09:53" %}} - exercise his full rights without any opposition to rule over the creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4199" display="1:09:59" %}} - that he made I tend to think about God's sovereignty in a in a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4206" display="1:10:06" %}} - multi-dimensional way on the one hand he has the right to rule creation because he made it I mean even if he was even if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4215" display="1:10:15" %}} - it were possible and it is not even if it were possible that to think of God's character as anything but good he has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4222" display="1:10:22" %}} - the right to rule because made it well just almost think of it like intellectual property rights right you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4229" display="1:10:29" %}} - know exact we have that God can remix and modify because he's the one who created it yes yeah so there is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4237" display="1:10:37" %}} - right of ownership on the one half but the Bible goes beyond that which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4243" display="1:10:43" %}} - actually you know it's like when when God said to Israel in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4248" display="1:10:48" %}} - Mali um how did he put it that it's in Malachi 1 but I'll paraphrase the idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4255" display="1:10:55" %}} - is this that even a donkey knows its master and will give due respect to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4261" display="1:11:01" %}} - to its master and um a father has uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4267" display="1:11:07" %}} - respect that is due to him so does a governor if I'm a father where is my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4272" display="1:11:12" %}} - respect I don't get anything you you don't treat me with any respect given my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4278" display="1:11:18" %}} - role my place in your life you wouldn't be a nation unless I made you one that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4284" display="1:11:24" %}} - what he was saying to them and more than once in the prophets he told them your  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4289" display="1:11:29" %}} - father was an araman was a Syrian and I I made him I took him out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4295" display="1:11:35" %}} - of Syria and made him into a great nation so basically I have the right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4302" display="1:11:42" %}} - make demands of you because you exist because of me that's the right of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4308" display="1:11:48" %}} - ownership and if anything were God that thing would have that right over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4313" display="1:11:53" %}} - creation that it makes but beyond that the argument that um exus is particular focused on is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4320" display="1:12:00" %}} - moral argument which is essentially this that God's character is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4326" display="1:12:06" %}} - good and that he is he is loving he is perfect he does not do any wrong so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4334" display="1:12:14" %}} - everything that Satan has accused him up has been proven to be false see God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4343" display="1:12:23" %}} - cannot abide evil and he does not do evil and he reconciles the the evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4350" display="1:12:30" %}} - person to himself if the if the evil person is willing to repent all of that is to say what better can you get who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4358" display="1:12:38" %}} - has your best interest at heart other than me in other words you are safest  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4364" display="1:12:44" %}} - and Most Blessed under my wings this is the second argument on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4370" display="1:12:50" %}} - one hand I have the right to rule over you because I made you on the other hand I have the right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4376" display="1:12:56" %}} - rule over you because nobody wants better things for you than I do and nobody can provide those things better  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4382" display="1:13:02" %}} - than I can like I am it for you if you're ever going to have anything good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4389" display="1:13:09" %}} - it's going to come from me that's the second argument now that second argument is more important from the excess point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4397" display="1:13:17" %}} - of you because this is a fight um of free will we have to make a willing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4403" display="1:13:23" %}} - choice if we reject God's right of ownership that's fine he doesn't rule  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4408" display="1:13:28" %}} - over us for eternity but then we don't end up in anything good for all eternity we are stuck in the Lake of Fire in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4414" display="1:13:34" %}} - place of misery but that for that reason the main focus here is the moral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4421" display="1:13:41" %}} - right given the chance to make an existence for yourself rather than to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4428" display="1:13:48" %}} - accept one that I make for you do you do any better and we live in a world where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4434" display="1:13:54" %}} - again and again the answer to that is no that we don't do better by ourselves we don't do better away from God's mercies  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4441" display="1:14:01" %}} - and his Graces so we see that God's right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4446" display="1:14:06" %}} - rule is rooted in the Perfection of his character the true sacrificial nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4452" display="1:14:12" %}} - his love for us that he is willing to give the most to give  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4458" display="1:14:18" %}} - everything even when we are in a position of enmity against him  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4463" display="1:14:23" %}} - that is the Seal of his sovereignty the right he has to rule over us and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4469" display="1:14:29" %}} - ends all of the satanic Rebellion it puts paid to all of Satan's arguments because it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4475" display="1:14:35" %}} - says if you rule over yourself you don't make anything better I can't make bad  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4481" display="1:14:41" %}} - things I can't make an evil world I cannot and I can't tolerate one and on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4487" display="1:14:47" %}} - top of that even if you have made an evil world I can reconcile you to myself  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4492" display="1:14:52" %}} - and give you a perfect world I don't think anything in the satanic rebellion  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4498" display="1:14:58" %}} - in all the lies that we have b as human beings can stand up to this that's the argument that exis is actually making  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4504" display="1:15:04" %}} - now when we think of this in terms of sovereignty um in terms of the uh what we call de facto deur uh Authority that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4514" display="1:15:14" %}} - God has you might also sort of think of it like this if you view God's abilities  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4519" display="1:15:19" %}} - um in the same way you might view like an apex predator like a tiger right a tiger has might might makes right sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4526" display="1:15:26" %}} - of thing right a tiger is the ruler of the Jungle simply because there is no one stronger than him right but a king  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4534" display="1:15:34" %}} - is not necessarily a king because he's the strongest right there might be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4539" display="1:15:39" %}} - Warriors or military leaders who have more military mind right or Scholars who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4545" display="1:15:45" %}} - have more intellectual Cloud a king is a the leader of a country at least  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4552" display="1:15:52" %}} - throughout history right not that we have King so much anymore but you know let me let me go with my parallel okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4557" display="1:15:57" %}} - um so a king is the king of a country not maybe because he is the strongest or the smartest but because he carries the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4565" display="1:16:05" %}} - scepter of rulership right um and when we think of in the Bible Jesus you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4571" display="1:16:11" %}} - uh subduing the nations with a rod of iron making them the foot stol of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4576" display="1:16:16" %}} - God God is King of the universe by existential Fiat because he is the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4582" display="1:16:22" %}} - with ownership right as we've talked about the one who has this uh not just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4588" display="1:16:28" %}} - because of strength but because of moral Authority um that is a level above just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4595" display="1:16:35" %}} - being the strongest that is having what we would call the moral right to control  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4602" display="1:16:42" %}} - what goes on in his Universe in the same way that a homeowner for example might have the moral right to control what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4608" display="1:16:48" %}} - goes on in his home right or the citizens of a country  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4613" display="1:16:53" %}} - having the right to self-determine what goes on in their country you see where I'm going with this right the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4620" display="1:17:00" %}} - is Gods to control by moral right um not just because he's the strongest and he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4625" display="1:17:05" %}} - can impose his will upon others but because he has the right to do it um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4631" display="1:17:11" %}} - that's God's sovereignty yeah all right well uh you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4636" display="1:17:16" %}} - obviously more to talk about in all of this um we will as you'll see again uh as we turn to some of the uh what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4642" display="1:17:22" %}} - would call as the characteristics of God manifesting in creation his love his Justice and his life here um we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4649" display="1:17:29" %}} - once again uh see the essential qualities his goodness his Holiness and his truth as well as his Sovereign  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4655" display="1:17:35" %}} - attitude towards us in grace mercy and peace all these things will recur as we talk about um how God manifests his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4662" display="1:17:42" %}} - goodness and his Holiness and his truth in creation um so those will be the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4667" display="1:17:47" %}} - topics that we turn to um in the next slides here um but this will kind of conclude the discussion that we've had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4674" display="1:17:54" %}} - here about God's sovereignty so God is unique um on account of his infinite nature um his abilities that no other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4682" display="1:18:02" %}} - can match and God is Sovereign on account of his moral perfection he has the right by existential Fiat to order  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4688" display="1:18:08" %}} - the universe as he sees fit because he is The Sovereign deure ruler of it these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4694" display="1:18:14" %}} - things together explain why God is due all obedience and honor and Glory  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4700" display="1:18:20" %}} - because he is the ruler of the universe um both by nature and by character um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4707" display="1:18:27" %}} - is the one that is in complete control of everything so we will pick up more as I say with these aspects of Love Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4715" display="1:18:35" %}} - and life on these parts of God's characters they manifest in creation uh as we keep on going through the next  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4721" display="1:18:41" %}} - slides in this lesson here all right so the first point that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4728" display="1:18:48" %}} - we are going to be going over now is how God is love and so this is kind of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4733" display="1:18:53" %}} - manifestation of his essential quality of goodness as it relates to Creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4738" display="1:18:58" %}} - for us in the universe and in the next couple sections we'll also be talking about how his Holiness manifests Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4745" display="1:19:05" %}} - and his truth manifest his life uh but here talking first about how his goodness manifests his love I'm going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4752" display="1:19:12" %}} - kind of read the paragraph This is again straight from the study on ichus here and then uh kind of go from there to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4757" display="1:19:17" %}} - elaborate on that so ikus says having love for his creatures is natural  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4763" display="1:19:23" %}} - consequence of God's goodness out of the intrinsic goodness of his character God loves us with a perfect love Desiring to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4770" display="1:19:30" %}} - help us in our sinful State however he does not Overlook his Holiness and Justice in the process and forgive our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4776" display="1:19:36" %}} - sin without consequence as evil suggests he should therefore God had to find a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4781" display="1:19:41" %}} - way to reach out to us in Love Without compromising his character and did so through the gift and sacrifice of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4787" display="1:19:47" %}} - only son on our behalf um so this is very parallel to what we had been talking about uh in the last section uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4796" display="1:19:56" %}} - talking uh kind of in this summary of God's sovereignty and his Sovereign plan for human history as he redeems Humanity  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4804" display="1:20:04" %}} - out of our sinfulness we talked about this this was this slide talking about how uh God possesses The Sovereign  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4810" display="1:20:10" %}} - authority to demonstrate love out of his goodness uh so this should sound familiar is what I'm saying um because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4816" display="1:20:16" %}} - we just talked about that actually but um this is the same thing that we've been saying is that everything for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4823" display="1:20:23" %}} - centers on the cross uh it is the inflection point in all of human history  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4828" display="1:20:28" %}} - that that single winning move where death Was Defeated once for all and God does this out of his love for us so not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4835" display="1:20:35" %}} - contradicting his Justice he reached out to us in love through the sacrifice of his son that we might be saved um also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4842" display="1:20:42" %}} - building on that theological vocabulary we say that Grace is the biblical name for God's policy of lovingly redeeming  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4849" display="1:20:49" %}} - us from our sins through Jesus Christ um so this is his his loving kindness you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4854" display="1:20:54" %}} - may also see older translations like the KJV use that a bit wordy for us perhaps  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4859" display="1:20:59" %}} - in Modern English but this idea of God's good will his grace his attitude of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4865" display="1:21:05" %}} - Grace towards humanity is shown in this so we accept and receive God's gracious offer of love and Redemption by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4872" display="1:21:12" %}} - accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our savior um so for Evangelical Christians this is nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4878" display="1:21:18" %}} - new right we have salvation by grace through faith not by works um but we accept God's love in fact we reciprocate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4886" display="1:21:26" %}} - God's love only by accepting Jesus Christ as our savior U by believing in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4891" display="1:21:31" %}} - him that is uh our act as Christians by which we demonstrate to God that we love him back um so that's where we'll start  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4899" display="1:21:39" %}} - here um I should also say that there's an interesting verse uh I think it's in 1 John chapter 4 it talks about how God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4906" display="1:21:46" %}} - is love like uh I don't know we don't want to get bogged down in the philosophy of this but um you know that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4913" display="1:21:53" %}} - basically because God is love we need to love one another just how God loves us so there's a lot of uh what I would call  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4921" display="1:22:01" %}} - practical application that comes across from this point um the Bible in a couple places uh uses God's sacrifice for us is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4929" display="1:22:09" %}} - this ought to be defining motivation for us to lay down our lives for each other uh the Brethren our brothers and sisters  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4936" display="1:22:16" %}} - in the church uh because we ought to follow God's example um so that's where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4942" display="1:22:22" %}} - all open us I mean we could certainly go through more of this passage here in 1 John chapter 4 but because God is love  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4948" display="1:22:28" %}} - so also we must love one another um uh you know in fact this is basically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4953" display="1:22:33" %}} - verbatim word for word what we just went over in that paragraph from the study was that in this love God was made  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4958" display="1:22:38" %}} - manifest among us through his kind of through his attitude of Grace that he sent his only son that we might live  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4964" display="1:22:44" %}} - through him um uh very traditional formulation of the Gospel itself so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4969" display="1:22:49" %}} - Audie do you have anything you want to pick up uh based on what we're talking about here specifically with regard to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4975" display="1:22:55" %}} - how God is love um yeah uh I I want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4982" display="1:23:02" %}} - say that first of all um like you said everything is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4989" display="1:23:09" %}} - centered around the cross of Jesus Christ and uh thought that that has uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="4995" display="1:23:15" %}} - caused me to um try to make sense of is why like what does what does that mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5003" display="1:23:23" %}} - um we know from First Corinthians 15 that the goal of everything that's happening in the universe in creation is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5010" display="1:23:30" %}} - that ultimately the kingdom will be turned over to the father we also know that what started all the rock the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5018" display="1:23:38" %}} - rockus in in creation was that Satan aspired to God's throne and wanted  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5025" display="1:23:45" %}} - to well commit a to take over the universe from the Lord we know that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5031" display="1:23:51" %}} - was happening so the whole thing really is about the fact that God is the rightful King of the universe and um I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5038" display="1:23:58" %}} - believe I mentioned last Saturday that um um God has the right to rule by by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5045" display="1:24:05" %}} - right of creation he owns creation but Satan essentially did not challenge that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5050" display="1:24:10" %}} - R he did not challenge that r on the basis of like well um You Don't Own  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5057" display="1:24:17" %}} - creation because you made it he challenged it more on the on the basis  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5063" display="1:24:23" %}} - of you don't love creation enough to Merit ruling over it because after all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5071" display="1:24:31" %}} - creation um comprises as well creatures that have a free will that is they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5078" display="1:24:38" %}} - the ability to respond to God's Authority either in submission or in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5084" display="1:24:44" %}} - Rebellion um so basically was like just because you made me does not give you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5091" display="1:24:51" %}} - the right to rule over me was essentially what he was saying and when he went on his um on his uh uh campaign  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5101" display="1:25:01" %}} - to win the hearts and minds of his fellow angels of course we know that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5106" display="1:25:06" %}} - made Arguments for Why God was not really acting in their best interest he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5111" display="1:25:11" %}} - had denied them of an actual physical body and probably restricted them in some other ways who knows what arguments  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5118" display="1:25:18" %}} - he made but the ex disposition of course is that he was particularly driving at the fact that Angels lacked physical  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5124" display="1:25:24" %}} - bodies that makes sense judging by what we saw in Jesus's Ministry how he often  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5131" display="1:25:31" %}} - had to deal with throwing demons out of the bodies of human beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5137" display="1:25:37" %}} - so the the what is at the root of creature Rebellion is this this feeling  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5143" display="1:25:43" %}} - like God is not acting in my best interest he doesn't love me enough to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5148" display="1:25:48" %}} - give me what I need to have or what is right for me to have he is denying me of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5156" display="1:25:56" %}} - things that are good for me to have so it is actually the love of God that is being called into  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5162" display="1:26:02" %}} - question if I am being denied something I want then God's love is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5169" display="1:26:09" %}} - either not there or it is insufficient and if God does not love me as I need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5176" display="1:26:16" %}} - be loved why should I obey him why should I submit to him because I will just live in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5182" display="1:26:22" %}} - misery so why Jesus's cross is at the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5188" display="1:26:28" %}} - center of everything is that it is the perfect the ultimate demonstration of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5193" display="1:26:33" %}} - God's love for his creation because here is the thing there is no greater love that it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5199" display="1:26:39" %}} - is possible for any creature to show than just as you have just pointed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5205" display="1:26:45" %}} - out laying down your life for those who are your  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5210" display="1:26:50" %}} - friends no no man can do better than that but God want went miles better than  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5219" display="1:26:59" %}} - that Jesus laid down his life for his enemies for his father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5224" display="1:27:04" %}} - enemies for those who if if they had the ability to do it they would drive God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5231" display="1:27:11" %}} - out of his creation they would even kill God if that were a thing that was was even possible that's what they tried to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5236" display="1:27:16" %}} - do with Jesus Christ anyway we can't do it we are God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5243" display="1:27:23" %}} - avowed enemies and his response to our enmity against him is to offer a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5251" display="1:27:31" %}} - sacrifice to reconcile us back to him to forgive his enemies that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5258" display="1:27:38" %}} - biggest thing in the universe nobody can do it and that put the light to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5264" display="1:27:44" %}} - everything Satan has said about God whether to his fellow to his fellow Angels or to or to human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5270" display="1:27:50" %}} - beings at the root of everything sin is God is denying me of something that is good for me to have so he cannot truly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5277" display="1:27:57" %}} - love me or his love for me is insufficient now we have seen that he has gone well beyond anything we could  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5285" display="1:28:05" %}} - possibly ask for by saying even though you have spited me and wronged me and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5292" display="1:28:12" %}} - destroyed my creation and even though you deserve the worst from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5297" display="1:28:17" %}} - me I am offering you an opportunity to come back into my family and here's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5302" display="1:28:22" %}} - thing Jesus gave us an excellent example of this an excellent demonstration of this when he talked about the parable of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5309" display="1:28:29" %}} - the of the prodal son The Prodigal Son returned recognizing that he had no  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5315" display="1:28:35" %}} - rights anymore in his father's house he did not ask to be restored to sunship he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5321" display="1:28:41" %}} - said make me one of your servants one of these slaves of yours because after all they they their tummies are always full  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5328" display="1:28:48" %}} - they may not be looking forward to any um inheritance anymore more but at least I will have a full tummy and I will have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5336" display="1:28:56" %}} - gainful work that is worth doing this is the position that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5341" display="1:29:01" %}} - we could hope for we had no right to even hope for that much and yet what God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5347" display="1:29:07" %}} - did was not just bring us back as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5352" display="1:29:12" %}} - creatures in his Universe he brought us back as his sons not just his sons but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5360" display="1:29:20" %}} - coair with Christ so the cross of Jesus Christ is very well and truly the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5366" display="1:29:26" %}} - because it demonstrates exactly the love that God has for his creation so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5372" display="1:29:32" %}} - now the argument for God's right to rule is both that yes he made the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5377" display="1:29:37" %}} - and is entitled to it because it is his creation but now for the Free Will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5383" display="1:29:43" %}} - creatures in it who have the right to respond to him either willingly or to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5390" display="1:29:50" %}} - reject him now he tells them I have the moral right to rule over you because nobody wants  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5397" display="1:29:57" %}} - better for you than I do that's uh I know when we uh talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5403" display="1:30:03" %}} - about this in the last section we brought up I think maybe we didn't I don't know if we didn't we should I'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5409" display="1:30:09" %}} - bring up the the parallel of parents um so we know that the Bible speaks of how we are to honor and obey our parents and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5417" display="1:30:17" %}} - part of that is because our parents want what's best for us they have this right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5422" display="1:30:22" %}} - to govern so long as we live under their roof uh to govern our actions as their children because of their care for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5429" display="1:30:29" %}} - they have been entrusted uh with our well-being and of course nobody is uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5437" display="1:30:37" %}} - more in control of the universe in God you know who who holds the lives of all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5442" display="1:30:42" %}} - of his creatures in his hands you know so while human parents may have the lives of their children in their hands  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5448" display="1:30:48" %}} - so to speak I you know up to a certain extent and uh perhaps even public servants so we might think elected  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5454" display="1:30:54" %}} - officials uh perhaps fancy themselves as having the lives of their constituents in their hands well God has the lives of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5462" display="1:31:02" %}} - everyone in the universe and his right Angel and and uh human being alike um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5468" display="1:31:08" %}} - one other thing I I just thought this verse in Romans is always such a powerful verse you know talking about how God died for us while we were yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5475" display="1:31:15" %}} - sinners right um this is love you know I I was thinking there's a verse in the gospels too uh Echoes this about uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5483" display="1:31:23" %}} - know for a good person someone might possibly Dare To Die maybe or maybe it's only here in Romans anyway point being  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5489" display="1:31:29" %}} - um this is self-sacrificing love and Par Parable The Prodigal son's actually really interesting in context when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5495" display="1:31:35" %}} - talk about love as well because part of love the love that we're supposed to have as Christians is we're supposed to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5501" display="1:31:41" %}} - celebrate like how God celebrates when Sinners repent um and I think very often our tendency as humans is not to throw  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5508" display="1:31:48" %}} - the party for the repentant sinner but be like the older brothers that says but look at me I have sacrificed so much why  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5514" display="1:31:54" %}} - are we celebrating for him look at look at all I've done right what about me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5520" display="1:32:00" %}} - that pride and ego get in the way right so even though what we're celebrating is someone coming from Death to life we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5526" display="1:32:06" %}} - but what about all my hard work where's my recognition um but God's love wants  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5532" display="1:32:12" %}} - what is actually best for all of us um and I don't want to get too off too off  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5537" display="1:32:17" %}} - topic here because I'm sure we could ramble for a while but you know Greek has all these different words for love you may have come across a teaching that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5544" display="1:32:24" %}} - that hits on this a bit too uh so the form of divine love typically in view when we talk about how God is love this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5551" display="1:32:31" %}} - love we're supposed to show to one another within the body of Christ and even show to the world is is the Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5556" display="1:32:36" %}} - word for it is agape um and it's typically described as divine unconditional love um Love without  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5563" display="1:32:43" %}} - strings attached so to speak and that is the sort of love whereby we love our enemies um there's also sto that's kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5571" display="1:32:51" %}} - kind of like the love between parents and children familial love um filia it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5577" display="1:32:57" %}} - not actually used directly in the New Testament like the Greek word for that isn't a fet which is a a verb that comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5585" display="1:33:05" %}} - up a bit more um and then there's also AOS which is the um uh you know sexual  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5591" display="1:33:11" %}} - passion um and so these are all translated in English with the same word but specifically what we're talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5597" display="1:33:17" %}} - about when we say God is love is that God is a he is this unconditional Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5603" display="1:33:23" %}} - love that wants the best for everyone and that's why he sent his son to die for us and take our sins upon his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5611" display="1:33:31" %}} - shoulders um to save us uh again out of this policy of Grace that he has towards  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5616" display="1:33:36" %}} - us acting in what is actually our best interest um redeeming us right that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5621" display="1:33:41" %}} - the theological term here buying uh us out of sin that's what redeeming is we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5627" display="1:33:47" %}} - have been redeemed as slaves to sin um so all very good points anything else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5633" display="1:33:53" %}} - you want to say before we go on to the next one no I I think we can go on okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5642" display="1:34:02" %}} - great so now we're going to be talking about how God is just and so uh God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5648" display="1:34:08" %}} - lovingly redeemed us out of our bondage to sin uh but God is also just and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5654" display="1:34:14" %}} - thing that should blow our minds about this a little bit is that when God forgives us on the basis of his Mercy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5660" display="1:34:20" %}} - because he sent his son to die Justice is being rendered this isn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5665" display="1:34:25" %}} - like God is somehow overlooking our sin is that Jesus paid for it um the debt  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5671" display="1:34:31" %}} - has been paid the accounts have been settled uh I think sometimes maybe we get uh I don't know quite how the right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5678" display="1:34:38" %}} - way to describe this might be but maybe we don't we don't feel that as impactfully as we ought that when when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5686" display="1:34:46" %}} - Jesus was on the cross he paid for that sin uh this uh in other words our forgiveness had a price that came with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5692" display="1:34:52" %}} - it it wasn't uh just with an arbitrary wave of the hand that God forgives the far forgives forgives us of our sin boy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5701" display="1:35:01" %}} - hard hard to say I guess um and so that's kind of what we're getting at here when we talk about God's justice so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5707" display="1:35:07" %}} - I'm gonna go ahead and read again coming right out of the study here on ikus so it says demanding Justice for his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5713" display="1:35:13" %}} - creatures is a natural consequence of God's holiness so holiness is that essential characteristic of God we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5719" display="1:35:19" %}} - been talking about before his need to be separate from sin um so out of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5724" display="1:35:24" %}} - intrinsic Holiness of his character God must must that's a mandatory must deal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5730" display="1:35:30" %}} - with us in perfect Justice righteously condemning us in our sinful State however he does not Overlook his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5736" display="1:35:36" %}} - goodness and his love in the process and abandon us to our sins as evil suggests he will for God found a way to treat us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5743" display="1:35:43" %}} - as righteous without compromising his character and did so through the gift and sacrifice of his only son on our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5749" display="1:35:49" %}} - behalf there's that turning everything back to the cross again that's been that central theme here as it should be right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5755" display="1:35:55" %}} - when we discuss everything in the plan of God um so God didn't compromise his goodness and his love here because he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5762" display="1:36:02" %}} - forgave us but he did so justly he did so uh in concordance with Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5769" display="1:36:09" %}} - because Jesus actually paid the cost for our sins so again with the technical  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5774" display="1:36:14" %}} - vocabulary Mercy is the biblical name for God's policy of justly I going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5780" display="1:36:20" %}} - keep emphasizing that just forgiving us on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ we accept and receive God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5786" display="1:36:26" %}} - merciful offer of justification by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our savior um so uh this kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5793" display="1:36:33" %}} - of pulls to mind a a kind of a reasonably famous verse here in 1 John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5798" display="1:36:38" %}} - chapter one that talks about um how God is actually just to forgive us our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5803" display="1:36:43" %}} - when we confess here if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5809" display="1:36:49" %}} - all unrighteousness um I don't want to just keep harping on the same thing but what we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5815" display="1:36:55" %}} - is important um because uh I I think sometimes uh it's easy in uh our modern  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5823" display="1:37:03" %}} - times where we talk about how God is love um God is forgiveness we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5828" display="1:37:08" %}} - about all these things as maybe God just doesn't take sin seriously uh you know maybe he can just kind of wave his hand  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5834" display="1:37:14" %}} - and make it go away or whatever but that really isn't how we ought to think about it because sin is a deadly sin leads to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5841" display="1:37:21" %}} - death it's what the Bible says the wages of sin are death and it is really serious stuff because sin separates us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5847" display="1:37:27" %}} - from God and absent the blood of Christ that we know redeems us we would be dead in our sins eternally dead in our sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5855" display="1:37:35" %}} - and so it's only because Jesus paid for that that God is able to justly forgive us of our sins um and so uh you know we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5864" display="1:37:44" %}} - might think of this as paying our debt on our behalf if sin puts us in debt then a just judge wouldn't let that debt  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5872" display="1:37:52" %}} - be forgiven without cause and Jesus uh the his payment for our sins upon the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5878" display="1:37:58" %}} - cross is that just cause that allows for the Forgiveness of our sins um that's kind of the emphasis here on God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5885" display="1:38:05" %}} - justice and this is why we should keep emphasizing uh how almost  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5892" display="1:38:12" %}} - um word's escaping me here it's just kind of how astounding the crosses in terms of what it reconciles what it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5898" display="1:38:18" %}} - means for God's love and his Mercy um and his justice to all be upheld by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5905" display="1:38:25" %}} - sacrifice that Jesus made on our behalf um is because God did all of this acting out of love but it also doesn't violate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5912" display="1:38:32" %}} - his his Justice it does not violate the need for uh sin to be paid for uh in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5919" display="1:38:39" %}} - order to be uh kind of the record set straight uh the the books balanced so to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5925" display="1:38:45" %}} - speak um and again just to reemphasize that point that the only way in which  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5931" display="1:38:51" %}} - our personal Ledger of sins and failures can be reset is to be washed personally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5937" display="1:38:57" %}} - in the blood of Christ and that only happens by us accepting and receiving Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5944" display="1:39:04" %}} - so uh that's how uh you know we accept God's Redemption his payment on our behalf that is how we are forgiven God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5951" display="1:39:11" %}} - can only forgive us his Justice only allows him to forgive us if we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5957" display="1:39:17" %}} - covered in the blood of Christ if we have accepted his payment otherwise he cannot pay for our sin um he cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5964" display="1:39:24" %}} - save those who are unwilling to be saved because his Justice simply doesn't allow it um so this is what we kind of are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5971" display="1:39:31" %}} - talking about when we say that God is just um and his Justice will not be denied um you know that's something we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5977" display="1:39:37" %}} - also get coming into uh the accounts of Revelation when Jesus returns in glory I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5983" display="1:39:43" %}} - think this is like Revelation chapter 19 picking up at like verses 11 see how good my memory is revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5990" display="1:39:50" %}} - 19 uh yeah so Heaven opens Jesus returns  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="5997" display="1:39:57" %}} - and then hap then Armageddon happens right he completely Slaughters the enemies of wickedness so um that is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6004" display="1:40:04" %}} - Just Desserts of sinful unrepentant sinfulness and so we can be thankful to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6010" display="1:40:10" %}} - God that through the cross he's given us this way to avoid that fate um and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6015" display="1:40:15" %}} - is by submitting ourselves to God receiving his forgiveness on the basis of the death of his son  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6022" display="1:40:22" %}} - so a you have things to add here yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6028" display="1:40:28" %}} - um do I really have much to add is just his Justice is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6033" display="1:40:33" %}} - um um that's one of the things that Satan uh attacked as well we we will  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6039" display="1:40:39" %}} - notice that Satan was not interested in attacking God's nature that is what he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6047" display="1:40:47" %}} - is in terms of his abilities in terms terms of his power uh as God he was he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6056" display="1:40:56" %}} - was attacking God on the basis of his character that is what he attacked was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6061" display="1:41:01" %}} - God's character he doesn't love us enough to give us the things that are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6066" display="1:41:06" %}} - right for us to have he's denying us of things that are good for us to have and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6072" display="1:41:12" %}} - um if we do something about it he is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6078" display="1:41:18" %}} - just because if he acts Injustice he's going to violate something in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6085" display="1:41:25" %}} - character so he has to either tolerate sin which means he is not just or else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6092" display="1:41:32" %}} - he will be forced to do something that is actually uh in violation of that love  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6099" display="1:41:39" %}} - which will sort sort of um prove his point that God didn't love them all that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6104" display="1:41:44" %}} - much so if God tolerates sin he's not just if he um go goes after them and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6112" display="1:41:52" %}} - punishes them for what they have done then he demonstrates that he really didn't love them he didn't want them to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6118" display="1:41:58" %}} - have what was good for them to have um so God's justice is important and I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6125" display="1:42:05" %}} - think the the most important thing to note about Justice when we're talking in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6130" display="1:42:10" %}} - reference to kingship and in reference to rulership is that Justice underpins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6137" display="1:42:17" %}} - security if you don't if imagine in the home for example if children start to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6143" display="1:42:23" %}} - feel like um their parents don't they play  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6150" display="1:42:30" %}} - favorites if so and so does this he doesn't get the same thing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6157" display="1:42:37" %}} - everybody else gets so if he's mischievous the parents ignore the Mischief but if someone else is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6163" display="1:42:43" %}} - mischievous the person gets the weight of all punishment dropped on them um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6171" display="1:42:51" %}} - this person gets all the nice things the other person so we know what that does in the home it creates resentment and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6177" display="1:42:57" %}} - and stuff this is where Justice actually matters because it it underpins the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6184" display="1:43:04" %}} - peace the harmony the security in a system so if God is Not Just then God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6192" display="1:43:12" %}} - does not have the right to rule over moral creatures that's it and we feel the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6198" display="1:43:18" %}} - way about the Kings we have right now wherever whether it's a president or it's a governor or it's a mayor or like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6205" display="1:43:25" %}} - we have here local government chairman or whatever it is we expect fairness because without it we live in constant  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6214" display="1:43:34" %}} - misery so if God is not going to address  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6219" display="1:43:39" %}} - himself to sin rightly that means if sin is committed it has to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6226" display="1:43:46" %}} - punished and if someone does right the person should be rewarded if he does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6231" display="1:43:51" %}} - do that that's a moral argument for his loss of the right to rule over moral  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6238" display="1:43:58" %}} - creatures yeah so of course where where I I I come at  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6244" display="1:44:04" %}} - the argument a bit differently is that I don't really make a difference between Justice and love I I I see God's justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6250" display="1:44:10" %}} - as a demonstration of his love because if you love the people over whom  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6256" display="1:44:16" %}} - you rule you want to make sure they're at peace with each other and at peace  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6261" display="1:44:21" %}} - with you which means everyone gets what is their their due what is right right  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6267" display="1:44:27" %}} - for them to have what is rightful for them to have so um the sense in which I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6273" display="1:44:33" %}} - would come at it is is something along the lines of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6280" display="1:44:40" %}} - because God is just he does not deny us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6285" display="1:44:45" %}} - of anything that is right for us to have he is absolutely fair to to all his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6290" display="1:44:50" %}} - moral creatures you might have heard in fact um earlier today I was watching a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6297" display="1:44:57" %}} - video um a discussion a debate between Alex o Conor uh also called The Cosmic  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6305" display="1:45:05" %}} - skeptic um uh on YouTube and Twitter uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6310" display="1:45:10" %}} - with Dr Jonathan M maachi or something I don't remember his son his soname too  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6317" display="1:45:17" %}} - well so part of that debate was along the lines this was this was the argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6322" display="1:45:22" %}} - that Alex made Alex is an atheist it was like it seems that where you born  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6330" display="1:45:30" %}} - determines exactly what your disposition to God will be because this country is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6337" display="1:45:37" %}} - skewed this way that country is skewed that way and it's like well so it means I'm predisposed to be a Christian just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6343" display="1:45:43" %}} - because of where I born and that seems to be a mark on God you just you gave me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6349" display="1:45:49" %}} - a raw deal and if you gave me a raw deal exactly how are you worthy of my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6356" display="1:45:56" %}} - submitting to your Authority so again the question of justice is still addressing the fact that God um either  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6364" display="1:46:04" %}} - has or does not have the right to rule over us as moral creatures this is exactly the nature of the relationship  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6372" display="1:46:12" %}} - we have with God it's always a question of what we think of his right to rule over us some people come at that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6379" display="1:46:19" %}} - argument from thep Ive of wisdom as well um well uh if we are smart enough to do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6385" display="1:46:25" %}} - this and that and that and we don't need God to do it for us then why do we need him to rule over us you know but in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6391" display="1:46:31" %}} - particular case we're focused on Justice and the perspective of the Bible on that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6398" display="1:46:38" %}} - is everybody gets their due which which is when you read Ecclesiastes which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6404" display="1:46:44" %}} - probably the one book of the Bible that addresses the unbeliever although it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6410" display="1:46:50" %}} - it's actually more focused everything in the Bible is focused on the believer really and um even even Ecclesiastes is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6417" display="1:46:57" %}} - telling the believer this is what life really is about so don't waste your time pursuing this and that and the other but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6424" display="1:47:04" %}} - the unbeliever should be able to relate very strongly with what um Ecclesiastes  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6429" display="1:47:09" %}} - says and at the end of it it says that God will reward everything that's done so that's also speaking to the justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6437" display="1:47:17" %}} - of God and we see the same thing in Revelation and even in the gospels where  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6442" display="1:47:22" %}} - Jesus keeps promising that he is returning with his reward in his hand so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6447" display="1:47:27" %}} - the whole idea here is God saying look what you get is what is fair to you this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6455" display="1:47:35" %}} - is the truth whether it is a matter of the experiences we are having in this life the way our own tests have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6462" display="1:47:42" %}} - structured I don't get tested the way anybody else is tested and nobody else  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6467" display="1:47:47" %}} - other people get tested in the way that I would will never be tested because I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6472" display="1:47:52" %}} - different and God addresses me as me he doesn't address me as if I was someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6478" display="1:47:58" %}} - else that's Justice and how does he deal with sin same thing across the board  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6486" display="1:48:06" %}} - Satan wanted to you know have his cake and eat it too we can do this and get  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6492" display="1:48:12" %}} - away with it because God is not going to violate his love for us by carrying out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6498" display="1:48:18" %}} - his Justice against us but in fact love demands Justice that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6504" display="1:48:24" %}} - the thing and and like like the Bible says he corrupted his wisdom with his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6509" display="1:48:29" %}} - own wickedness so when his heart was um grew arrogant against God he became  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6514" display="1:48:34" %}} - incapable of seeing precisely how his wisdom had become foolishness if God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6522" display="1:48:42" %}} - loves he's going to be just now um when we sin there has to be Justice against  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6529" display="1:48:49" %}} - that sin but because God loves us he provides a way for us to be rescued from that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6536" display="1:48:56" %}} - judgment but that means he has to place something between his Justice and us so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6543" display="1:49:03" %}} - that his Justice is s is satisfied and we are spared and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6550" display="1:49:10" %}} - again is where the Cross of Christ comes in so we see that in all every time we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6556" display="1:49:16" %}} - talk about God's character for us believers of course for the Angels by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6563" display="1:49:23" %}} - extension we see that God's character is fully fully expressed and fully taught  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6571" display="1:49:31" %}} - to us through the sacrifice of Jesus because without that sacrifice God could  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6578" display="1:49:38" %}} - not carry out his Justice against sin and still Save The Sinner so yeah yes I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6586" display="1:49:46" %}} - think one thing to just elaborate on here a couple points is that first of all God's justice is in stark contrast  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6593" display="1:49:53" %}} - to what the world calls Justice Audi brought up a couple examples here of how God uh judges us perfectly at the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6599" display="1:49:59" %}} - individual level which is something that human Justice systems cannot do at least completely properly I mean we can do our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6605" display="1:50:05" %}} - best um but even if our rulers are imperfect in their application of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6610" display="1:50:10" %}} - justice so for example they might favor the rich and Powerful uh that has been a characterization of so-called Justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6618" display="1:50:18" %}} - systems throughout all history is well if you enough money and power you can kind of wiggle your way out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6624" display="1:50:24" %}} - consequences under the law right not so with God though um so that's one point in God's justice when we say God is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6631" display="1:50:31" %}} - we mean it um in all circumstances part of this comes with God being all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6637" display="1:50:37" %}} - powerful is that God has the capability to enforce Justice um so uh you might  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6643" display="1:50:43" %}} - have heard of of people called enforcers in gains right uh this is not a label we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6649" display="1:50:49" %}} - would apply to God per se but um God has the ab the ability he has the power to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6656" display="1:50:56" %}} - carry that sword to ensure that Justice is Meed out effectively um and this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6663" display="1:51:03" %}} - no small thing because um if the other guy has a bigger stick than you how are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6668" display="1:51:08" %}} - you going to hold him to Justice right um but God will God wins in the end you know we've mentioned this Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6674" display="1:51:14" %}} - chapter 19 when Jesus returns the world will face God's righteous judgment and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6679" display="1:51:19" %}} - no one will able to stand against God um so that's one important Point another thing so AI had mentioned kind of about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6685" display="1:51:25" %}} - how a lot of the satanic rebellion was the skepticism that God really loves uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6690" display="1:51:30" %}} - because if God loved us why wouldn't he give us these things that we think we want right that are good for us in our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6695" display="1:51:35" %}} - opinion um well people doubt God too you know another reason why people uh have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6702" display="1:51:42" %}} - shall we say less than uh uh happy thoughts about God or you know Desiring  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6708" display="1:51:48" %}} - to go after him is that they view God as fundamentally unfair um so you brought up that point about well what happens if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6715" display="1:51:55" %}} - you're born in such and such culture such and such life circumstances doesn't that put you to disadvantage right I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6720" display="1:52:00" %}} - brought up on the screen when you're talking about that I brought up Romans 1 famous passage about natural Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6726" display="1:52:06" %}} - which we've talked about says that everybody knows that God exists from that which has been created so truly people are without excuse to begin with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6732" display="1:52:12" %}} - but even in those circumstances in which people are born uh maybe into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6738" display="1:52:18" %}} - household with less money less education less opportunity God knows all these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6743" display="1:52:23" %}} - things and because he perfectly knows our circumstances Justice will be perfect um so I all of this I you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6751" display="1:52:31" %}} - kind of preaching into the choir I'm assuming but when we say God is just we are talking from a kind of divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6757" display="1:52:37" %}} - theological point of view in a way that human Justice systems cannot match um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6763" display="1:52:43" %}} - and uh this is kind of what we mean when this entire lesson we're going through is about God's perfect character um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6770" display="1:52:50" %}} - human systems that are you know some sort of attempted mirror on uh uh God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6776" display="1:52:56" %}} - moral Divine Law God's justice are only imperfect representations um but God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6782" display="1:53:02" %}} - justice is actually complete so uh any any more thoughts there or shall we go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6789" display="1:53:09" %}} - on to the next one yeah I believe we can I actually I have a something to bring  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6795" display="1:53:15" %}} - up regarding that so I recently um was speaking to a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6802" display="1:53:22" %}} - friend of mine and W witnessing to her and um she's an unbeliever so she  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6808" display="1:53:28" %}} - brought up God's justice and basically what she said was  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6814" display="1:53:34" %}} - um she didn't under she didn't understand and she's being perfectly honest like I believe I believe in her  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6820" display="1:53:40" %}} - when she said that she's like I really don't understand when people say Jesus died on the cross for my sins I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6827" display="1:53:47" %}} - she says I don't understand what that means so I tried to explain it to her um but she basically her argument  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6835" display="1:53:55" %}} - was why should I even be punished eternally for sins that I commit when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6841" display="1:54:01" %}} - I'm like I only live to be like 80 years old or 90 years old why should I be condemned eternally for like when my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6849" display="1:54:09" %}} - lifespan is only you know tiny compared to Eternity so her  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6855" display="1:54:15" %}} - her so she said from the very get-go God is unjust because I because I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6861" display="1:54:21" %}} - deserve hell why should I accept Christ's sacrifice why should even accept God's offer of forgiveness  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6868" display="1:54:28" %}} - for a punish that I don't deserve in the first place it's not necessarily I'm good enough to get into heaven it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6875" display="1:54:35" %}} - I'm not bad enough to go H the idea kind of different the idea here being that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6881" display="1:54:41" %}} - temporal actions have eternal consequences and that is the the point of attack is that correct yes correct  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6889" display="1:54:49" %}} - all all right aie you want to you want to take a step at this one first I mean I certainly have thoughts but uh you can go first I'll follow okay so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6898" display="1:54:58" %}} - I mean fundamentally with regards to this one of the things to understand is that God is eternal perfect right that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6905" display="1:55:05" %}} - one of the things we understand about God's perfect character so to take that Romans one passage that we brought up um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6912" display="1:55:12" %}} - you know basically we the reason why um and I think probably the root of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6918" display="1:55:18" %}} - misunderstanding is that hell is not to punish us right unfortunately this has  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6923" display="1:55:23" %}} - permeated cultural understanding of hell for a very long time you know I I'd say even among Evangelical Christians among  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6929" display="1:55:29" %}} - people who take the Bible seriously take inherency inspiration seriously a lot of people still think that God sends people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6935" display="1:55:35" %}} - to hell to punish them the only reason you are sent to hell um Jesus paid for  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6942" display="1:55:42" %}} - the sin of all on the cross right there's this teaching in theology uh so-called Double Jeopardy right if God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6948" display="1:55:48" %}} - judged Jesus for sins then if God judges people for those sins in Hell well the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6954" display="1:55:54" %}} - sins are being judged twice you see um and the misunderstanding here is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6959" display="1:55:59" %}} - human beings are not qualified to pay for sin um this is why the Bible goes on and on about Jesus being the lamb  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6966" display="1:56:06" %}} - without blemish a perfect sacrifice that's why he had to be fully God yet fully man to pay for our sin Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6973" display="1:56:13" %}} - the only person who has ever lived and ever will live who could pay for sin who was qualified to pay for sin human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6980" display="1:56:20" %}} - beings are not qualified to pay for sin because we are ourselves stained we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6985" display="1:56:25" %}} - in like unworthy sacrifices but more to this question specifically if you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6991" display="1:56:31" %}} - view hell any longer as a way to punish human beings hell is simply the lack of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="6998" display="1:56:38" %}} - acceptance of Jesus Christ the lack of this Redemption for sin then um I just I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7005" display="1:56:45" %}} - I feel like pun the punishment angle really gets in a gets in the way of people appreciating this point right when the Bible says that the only sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7012" display="1:56:52" %}} - that cannot be forgiven is unbelief or blasphemy against the Holy Spirit which of course I this takes to be unbelief um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7020" display="1:57:00" %}} - that is people end up in hell because of that right because they choose not to accept God's uh God's offering his olive  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7028" display="1:57:08" %}} - branch of forgiveness um so I don't know if maybe if I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7034" display="1:57:14" %}} - getting to the underlying root cause of temporal versus eternity but this kind of explains why human beings can't pay  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7040" display="1:57:20" %}} - for their sin aside from Jesus Christ um I mean you want to clarify it all I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7046" display="1:57:26" %}} - mean ises that help or do we need to talk more about well I think the whole okay so like she's coming from a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7053" display="1:57:33" %}} - just to give you a background on her she's um really ended Theos gnosticism where she she like when she I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7060" display="1:57:40" %}} - was explained to her about Adam and Eve and how like death came into the world from sin and her perspective is well  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7067" display="1:57:47" %}} - Adam and Eve were were perfect and they needed to sin in order to grow and become like God so she's got this like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7075" display="1:57:55" %}} - like not like this view where sin is not you need sin to grow like she will never  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7080" display="1:58:00" %}} - grow or be Sanctified unless well unless she makes mistakes and learns from them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7085" display="1:58:05" %}} - yeah and don't agree but right I know like I know but like I think she's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7091" display="1:58:11" %}} - viewing like I can see her perspective like if you're a like a regular human  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7096" display="1:58:16" %}} - being and you've never raped someone murdered someone like if I mean you sin but you've never really really hurt  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7103" display="1:58:23" %}} - someone I can see where someone is like why you know other than like maybe Cara like oh I kind of like I was mean to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7110" display="1:58:30" %}} - this person today so then maybe someone's mean to me three days later why should I why do I need someone to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7116" display="1:58:36" %}} - die for me that that that's like why how are my sins so bad that I commit on this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7122" display="1:58:42" %}} - you know on this planet while I'm here so bad that I need someone to actually like be put to death for me that I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7129" display="1:58:49" %}} - that's where she's coming from yeah I I when my niece um one of my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7137" display="1:58:57" %}} - nieces my brother's children when they were here with with us uh we were having  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7142" display="1:59:02" %}} - prayer session um one of our um morning prayer sessions and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7148" display="1:59:08" %}} - I I was trying to make a point and I asked whether I was asking each of them um do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7156" display="1:59:16" %}} - you have you ever sinned have you ever done anything wrong because I wanted to explain something about the cross and my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7164" display="1:59:24" %}} - niece my brother's oldest daughter actually said no she' never done anything wrong and I was like I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7171" display="1:59:31" %}} - she's six so but I was so I mean I don't I don't think I had heard that in a long  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7178" display="1:59:38" %}} - time that there was anyone who actually thought I've never done anything wrong I thought that was quite amazing to hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7185" display="1:59:45" %}} - from anybody right but um some some people really just don't count the big  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7192" display="1:59:52" %}} - things like as long as I'm not doing yeah the Small Things They don't count the small things so as long as I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7198" display="1:59:58" %}} - doing some of those big things I've never raped never killed basically never murdered anyone  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7204" display="2:00:04" %}} - and I've never um committed robbery if I pilfered it's just pilfering it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7210" display="2:00:10" %}} - that big of a deal if I told a white lie was just telling a white light it's not like I actually went out there and and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7217" display="2:00:17" %}} - defamed someone or sland someone or something like that so if it's all these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7222" display="2:00:22" %}} - small things well everybody does it can't be that bad it's not bad it's just it's just part of life and I mean I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7230" display="2:00:30" %}} - imagine someone thinking that way but I don't think I have come across anyone recently that has actually said it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7238" display="2:00:38" %}} - except for my six-year-old niece which was pretty interesting and when people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7243" display="2:00:43" %}} - say that if they would ever say it to my face I would tell them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7251" display="2:00:51" %}} - yeah if you were the one judging like if you were the lawgiver the law maker then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7259" display="2:00:59" %}} - I would say you have a point because you define what is right and wrong but since  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7264" display="2:01:04" %}} - you're not the one defining it and you're the one responding to the definition yeah I don't think I'm going  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7270" display="2:01:10" %}} - to take your word for it that's just the fact of it the Bible is actually pretty clear that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7276" display="2:01:16" %}} - himself this is job that God found fault  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7281" display="2:01:21" %}} - with his holy ones referring to the angels and that some that was something that didn't register very well with me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7286" display="2:01:26" %}} - until I think it was even probably within the past few weeks that the thing that the import of that statement hit me  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7293" display="2:01:33" %}} - which was essentially this Satan was smart enough that what he crafted seemed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7299" display="2:01:39" %}} - to be full proof that no one could find fault with it not even God that was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7305" display="2:01:45" %}} - idea that God could not accuse him of sin in what he had just done he had  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7310" display="2:01:50" %}} - basically essentially trapped God in a logical contradiction so how was God going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7316" display="2:01:56" %}} - accuse him of sin that's what he thought he had accomplished and that's the arrogance of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7323" display="2:02:03" %}} - sin I I think one thing I want to Pivot to when we talk about this too is there's the implicit assumption here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7329" display="2:02:09" %}} - that this punishment for like basically punishment fitting the crime is unjust  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7334" display="2:02:14" %}} - um if you view that as a presupposition um this kind of comes into the Audie and I had briefly touched on this I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7340" display="2:02:20" %}} - remember exactly when in our discussion of these things basically something good because God said it's good or is does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7348" display="2:02:28" %}} - God just happen to conform to I don't know goodness and Justice floating about there this in philosophy this is called  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7354" display="2:02:34" %}} - the uer a dilemma um basically is it good and just because God wills it or does God will it because it's good and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7359" display="2:02:39" %}} - just I I don't you know for a lot of the time I think this is a pedantic distinction uh in practice however with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7366" display="2:02:46" %}} - regards to this question basically the Bible is pretty clear I pulled up this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7371" display="2:02:51" %}} - this verse here Romans chapter 6 saying that the wages of sin is death that's very clear in Genesis chapter uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7378" display="2:02:58" %}} - early chapters of Genesis that um the the price for sin is death right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7383" display="2:03:03" %}} - through through sin death came into the world sort of thing Romans chapter 5 talks about this as well contrasting how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7389" display="2:03:09" %}} - death came into the world through Adam with how reconciliation and uh I I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7395" display="2:03:15" %}} - go pull up the context in Romans chapter 5 but how basically Jesus does what came through Adam right and and uh the many  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7402" display="2:03:22" %}} - are saved through the actions of the one in Jesus um so where I'm going with all of this is that the Bible pretty clearly  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7409" display="2:03:29" %}} - and unequivocally teaches that you know the the consequences of sin is death and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7416" display="2:03:36" %}} - separation from God um and so if someone comes to us and says well that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7422" display="2:03:42" %}} - unjust on where are they getting their their standard of Justice from right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7429" display="2:03:49" %}} - you know basically because of the Bible teaches this and see this is one of those things where um it can be tricky  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7435" display="2:03:55" %}} - to be convincing in an apologetic fashion in an intellectual fashion to someone who doesn't want to believe um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7441" display="2:04:01" %}} - so if you say how this argument would work for us as a Christian probably goes something like the Bible clearly teaches  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7447" display="2:04:07" %}} - that uh the consequences of sin is death um so not just physical death but spiritual death separation from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7453" display="2:04:13" %}} - leading to Eternal and or second death is what we would call it um that's the consequence of sin right and we all sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7460" display="2:04:20" %}} - Romans 3:23 says that James 3:2 says that therefore absent uh accepting Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7466" display="2:04:26" %}} - Christ as our Lord and savior that is the Eternal Destiny of all of us because all of us sin that's the consequences of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7472" display="2:04:32" %}} - sin um where people get hung up is they say well murder is a quote unquote worse sin than white lies or something like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7480" display="2:04:40" %}} - that but fundamentally the the sin that we speak of here all of that has this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7485" display="2:04:45" %}} - consequence of separating us from God um and so for people who believe the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7492" display="2:04:52" %}} - the verses I just quoted get you right there right but for people who don't believe the Bible it's going to seem  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7498" display="2:04:58" %}} - like so much nonsense because they're not looking with eyes of Faith they don't have that spiritual perspective um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7506" display="2:05:06" %}} - so a rejection of God and it's it's kind of like if if you want to eat at my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7511" display="2:05:11" %}} - dinner table you're going to have to take your shoes off and come into my house and sit down and if you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7517" display="2:05:17" %}} - choose to do that take your shoes off you oh that's not fair I want to eat with my shoes on then you know I'm not  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7524" display="2:05:24" %}} - going to let you at my dinner table and it's the same thing it's a just rejection of the person of God it and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7531" display="2:05:31" %}} - them deciding know I'm going to do it my way which is fun with me go eat wherever you want but you're not gonna eat a my  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7536" display="2:05:36" %}} - tape that's how God is looking at that's an amazing analogy actually that's like a really good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7542" display="2:05:42" %}} - analogy well if you want no part in God if you say you want no part in God and everything good comes through God I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7549" display="2:05:49" %}} - we believe that as Christians it's self- selected right but where I'm going with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7554" display="2:05:54" %}} - this sometimes is it's really tricky this is why it's a spiritual gift apologetics is a spiritual gift how do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7560" display="2:06:00" %}} - we craft these things in a way that's Winsome for the gospel without alienating our audience but we yet we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7567" display="2:06:07" %}} - not compromising on the truth and I don't know I like I will confess you know even though I think Dr lugan Bill  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7574" display="2:06:14" %}} - is actually rather Adept at it when he does engage in what I would term apolog and I don't consider myself completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7580" display="2:06:20" %}} - terrible at it either it's just not where my strength is so I can give you the biblical argument I I laid out kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7587" display="2:06:27" %}} - just back of the napkin sort of argument that I just gave you but when it comes to someone who will just reject that out  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7593" display="2:06:33" %}} - of hand and say well I I just I don't like I don't believe that right I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7599" display="2:06:39" %}} - have your assumptions I I I'm not willing to just listen to what the Bible says how do you convince them that what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7605" display="2:06:45" %}} - we're talking about is just uh that God has the moral Authority that's what we've been talking about in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7611" display="2:06:51" %}} - sovereignty that this is how he structured the Justice in the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7616" display="2:06:56" %}} - that sinning against an infinitely uh just and holy God leads to Eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7621" display="2:07:01" %}} - consequences if someone doubts the justice of that what can you say to them  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7627" display="2:07:07" %}} - in an apologetics context I mean good question off the top of my head I can't give you an answer that I that I would  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7633" display="2:07:13" %}} - assume they would find convincing and I think it's important to note that they might not find anything convincing this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7638" display="2:07:18" %}} - point right right you know because something that I thought of too like like and I thought I kind of thought of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7644" display="2:07:24" %}} - this after the fact after I talked to her like maybe if I talk to her again I'll bring it up but you know we we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7650" display="2:07:30" %}} - live forever too like God doesn't destroy us we don't go to Oblivion we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7655" display="2:07:35" %}} - like God created us to be forever so yeah so when we do sin it's not yeah we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7662" display="2:07:42" %}} - we sinned while we were on this Earth but it's still like kind of like an ET  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7667" display="2:07:47" %}} - not eternal being sinning but I mean I mean I could see that part of it and then also like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7674" display="2:07:54" %}} - you see all the evil in the world and you see where sin leads like the wickedness of men and then I don't know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7680" display="2:08:00" %}} - about you guys but when I sin like when I like yell at my mom and dad or lose my temper or something I can see like I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7687" display="2:08:07" %}} - feel that emotion in me and I can see how like if it wasn't checked how it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7693" display="2:08:13" %}} - could eventually turn into that wickedness and yeah and all of us too like you have no idea how much Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7700" display="2:08:20" %}} - Spirit restraint is on our lives like like the difference between a person who you know grew up in a loving family who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7707" display="2:08:27" %}} - like maybe when they get angry at their parents like you know nothing bad happens whereas maybe a difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7712" display="2:08:32" %}} - between a person who had abusive parents like really abusive parents they get angry at their parents they might end up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7718" display="2:08:38" %}} - killing or hurting their parents like something like that where so yeah like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7724" display="2:08:44" %}} - even though we like it seems like we make we do small sins that don't have a big consequence like those small sins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7730" display="2:08:50" %}} - and just that act of sinning the evilness is like in there you know what I'm saying like it's yeah well and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7737" display="2:08:57" %}} - is why this is why I was trying to emphasize that when you take the punishment equation out of hell because  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7743" display="2:09:03" %}} - fundamentally the only reason why people go to hell is not because of sin it's because right they reject Christ's uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7750" display="2:09:10" %}} - off you know God's offer of Salvation suddenly this my sins are less bad than  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7755" display="2:09:15" %}} - that other person's sins goes completely out the window because that's not why anyone Goes to Hell right yeah now I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7760" display="2:09:20" %}} - will say that I can't speak for other Christians it's uncomfortable when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7766" display="2:09:26" %}} - when we teach about the scandalousness of Grace right the whole if Hitler repented would he have gone to heaven  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7771" display="2:09:31" %}} - sort of thing biblically speaking salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ look at Paul who  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7777" display="2:09:37" %}} - persecuted the early church I'm sure there were people in the early church who were not happy with God in God's uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7783" display="2:09:43" %}} - justice you know they probably put Justice in scare quotes who were offended by by the fact that God chose  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7789" display="2:09:49" %}} - to use Paul as the Apostle of the Gentiles right the one who had persecuted the church um but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7798" display="2:09:58" %}} - we're getting right back to you know every single person is uh worthy of that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7805" display="2:10:05" %}} - condemnation right and so this idea that we want people who uh you know committed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7812" display="2:10:12" %}} - all these really terrible things in life to be punished more I mean people that computes in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7818" display="2:10:18" %}} - terms of people's justice but this is this is when we say Jesus died for the sins of the world it is what makes that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7825" display="2:10:25" %}} - so scandalous um is that absolutely no one deserves that that sort of redemption um go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7833" display="2:10:33" %}} - ahead yeah I I mean um what you said uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7839" display="2:10:39" %}} - there was something you said I wanted to get in on but I think something else was overtaken it if anyone is really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7845" display="2:10:45" %}} - measuring themselves against other people I would okay yeah it was what you said about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7851" display="2:10:51" %}} - Paul um that was it and I think that was a very very good uh point to make even  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7860" display="2:11:00" %}} - ananas who was sent by the Lord to give Paul the gospel was reluctant to go  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7867" display="2:11:07" %}} - because of how unfair he felt it was this is the man who's been murdering us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7873" display="2:11:13" %}} - and you want me to go and preach life to him so that he will be saved yeah that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7881" display="2:11:21" %}} - doesn't seem fair and we might remember was the same position that Jona  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7887" display="2:11:27" %}} - took so um but you see each of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7893" display="2:11:33" %}} - things whether it's the it's the question of how we think our own sins stack up against what what really  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7900" display="2:11:40" %}} - matters in terms of what must be called sin and how we stack up against other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7906" display="2:11:46" %}} - people it's still missing the point point we're making ourselves the definition of the law we are saying if I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7914" display="2:11:54" %}} - think it's bad then it's bad if I don't think it's bad then it's not bad what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7921" display="2:12:01" %}} - how how does that compute in our minds in the eyes of the Lord the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7927" display="2:12:07" %}} - smallest sin is no different than the greatest sin that's it and the reason we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7934" display="2:12:14" %}} - get that is that we don't know what sin is where God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7941" display="2:12:21" %}} - concerned sin is a rejection of his right to rule and exist as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7949" display="2:12:29" %}} - God it's a rejection of him of his own very self if he were a creature like us sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7956" display="2:12:36" %}} - would be murdering him because it it denies the essence of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7962" display="2:12:42" %}} - being sin is not just something that um like it's not not cosmetic at all it's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7969" display="2:12:49" %}} - cosmic failure we look at it as a small thing but it is actually an infraction of an  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7977" display="2:12:57" %}} - infinite Justice we have violated the justice of an infinite God which means  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7983" display="2:13:03" %}} - we have done something that is infinite in its very nature but because we are confined in this state where we know our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7990" display="2:13:10" %}} - lives are measured in days that take by and we are we are the the the effect of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="7998" display="2:13:18" %}} - the things we do don't seem to Ripple that far it's like why is it that big of a deal but it's not about us it's about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8006" display="2:13:26" %}} - the person that says do not do or that said do that's the person that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8013" display="2:13:33" %}} - that's the standard of Justice that's the person we are measuring against and when we did something that violated his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8021" display="2:13:41" %}} - Justice that thing is measured by his Justice not by us so there is no small  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8027" display="2:13:47" %}} - sin in the the eyes of the Lord if the only sin that was ever committed in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8032" display="2:13:52" %}} - human history was one small white lie it would have still taken the cross of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8039" display="2:13:59" %}} - Jesus Christ to save the person who committed it even if that's the only thing they ever  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8045" display="2:14:05" %}} - did so there is there is no small sin in the eyes of the Lord whether it's big or  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8051" display="2:14:11" %}} - small is only measured by us in terms of how it affects those around us and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8057" display="2:14:17" %}} - is a very small measure really it's about consequences you know this is why this is such a tricky I pulled up uh on  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8064" display="2:14:24" %}} - the screen by the way the ichus has a we will get to it if we continue doing um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8070" display="2:14:30" %}} - Bible basics you know hom mariology the study of sin there's a lot to it right I'm not saying oh you have to go read  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8076" display="2:14:36" %}} - 500 pages otherwise you don't really understand sin but the point we're making here is that this is a worthy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8083" display="2:14:43" %}} - conversation to have um about what is sin um what are the effects of it how does it separate us from God how does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8090" display="2:14:50" %}} - God forgive sin the mechanics of it um all of that um but I will say and again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8096" display="2:14:56" %}} - I I tried to emphasize this earlier even if what we're saying doesn't come off as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8101" display="2:15:01" %}} - uh convincing to people that doesn't mean we shouldn't say it um you know so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8107" display="2:15:07" %}} - uh there there may be this tendency to feel like we have to win arguments it's not about winning arguments it's about sharing the truth right and when we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8116" display="2:15:16" %}} - that uh when we sin against a a perfect infinite just God it  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8121" display="2:15:21" %}} - has infinite consequences and someone scoffs and said well why I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8126" display="2:15:26" %}} - understand that I don't get that that doesn't seem fair to me it's not our job to change their mind per se we present  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8133" display="2:15:33" %}} - what the Bible teaches and then we let the chips fall where they may I mean obviously some people are called to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8139" display="2:15:39" %}} - engage more or less than others but um I I I think we've covered a good bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8144" display="2:15:44" %}} - of ground here I don't know you tell us Abby are there more facets to this you want to go over or um not right now I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8151" display="2:15:51" %}} - mean there's there's a lot we talked about so many things we talked a long time but um I'll bring up  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8158" display="2:15:58" %}} - more things later okay great yeah you guys did a good job on this so this is one of those challenges to God's justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8165" display="2:16:05" %}} - that we think about um people I mean people have a hard time with it you know the problem of evil just generally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8170" display="2:16:10" %}} - speaking not even talking about uh the the this justice of sin or people's perceived lack thereof but just you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8178" display="2:16:18" %}} - why aren't evil people punished more um you know how how can evil exist in the world if God is just Etc um people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8187" display="2:16:27" %}} - question God's justice they have they doubt it and they because of that they say I can't follow such a God right if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8194" display="2:16:34" %}} - God's really like that then he's not for me um it's a very real issue in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8199" display="2:16:39" %}} - church but again fundamentally we can only do our best presenting the truth as the Bible teaches it but we can't force  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8206" display="2:16:46" %}} - people to believe it um and so if people are determined in their minds to have such a low opinion of God and his  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8213" display="2:16:53" %}} - Justice that they won't even consider how some of these things might work or or how what the Bible says is actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8219" display="2:16:59" %}} - true there's not a lot we can do to make them do that um all right well good conversation so I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8227" display="2:17:07" %}} - think this is where we'll cut our discussion of God being just and we'll pick up with the last one in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8233" display="2:17:13" %}} - particular lesson talking how God is life in just a moment here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8241" display="2:17:21" %}} - so finishing off uh kind of how God's qualities manifest in creation we're going to be talking about life now um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8248" display="2:17:28" %}} - this perhaps is one of the more abstract consequences here when we say that God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8254" display="2:17:34" %}} - truth leads to life sometimes people are like well I would seems like even people  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8261" display="2:17:41" %}} - who are you know buying into lies are still alive right I think um part of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8266" display="2:17:46" %}} - what might help understand understand this is when we talk about uh spiritual truth right the truth about who Jesus is  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8272" display="2:17:52" %}} - and what he did um Jesus says um you know he talking about uh the bread that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8279" display="2:17:59" %}} - comes down from heaven this is John chapter 6 Jesus as the bread of life this is what sustains us as Christians  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8286" display="2:18:06" %}} - not even physical food I mean it's a metaphor of course but you know the idea being that uh we man you know also when  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8294" display="2:18:14" %}} - Jesus is tested uh Jesus quotes scripture saying man does not live on uh bread alone but upon every worth that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8300" display="2:18:20" %}} - comes from God um not paraphrasing but happens during the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness um this is what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8307" display="2:18:27" %}} - mean by truth is what gives us life um you might also think of uh John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8312" display="2:18:32" %}} - 4 uh with the woman at the Samaritan woman at the well I'm talking about living water that's the truth that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8319" display="2:18:39" %}} - Springs up within us giving us life um this is all over the place in the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8326" display="2:18:46" %}} - so as I say maybe it's a little bit harder to wrap our heads around this one in particular when we say well how does  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8332" display="2:18:52" %}} - truth give us life um in fact by just going from the Gospel of John here in John chapter 8 um uh truth will set you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8340" display="2:19:00" %}} - free there's another another verse that talks about how um you will be free indeed right if you believe in the truth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8346" display="2:19:06" %}} - if you abide in the word of God the truth will set you free and uh truly how  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8352" display="2:19:12" %}} - we think about this is that are we really living if our lives are in shackles and bondage right we don't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8360" display="2:19:20" %}} - real life we don't have uh an actual appreciation for what living means until  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8365" display="2:19:25" %}} - we submit ourselves to God and we do the things that he would have of us because that's the only time when we are actually truly free as humans um so all  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8373" display="2:19:33" %}} - of this to say this idea of uh the God is life and the life that he gives us  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8380" display="2:19:40" %}} - being firmly cemented in uh God being truth right God being uh uh filled by uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8387" display="2:19:47" %}} - truth and faithfulness this is God's aspect of his character manifesting in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8393" display="2:19:53" %}} - True Life in this world right Freedom leaving on the words that come from God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8399" display="2:19:59" %}} - that speak to the life the Salvation that we have in Christ Jesus um as we talked about in John chapter 6 John  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8405" display="2:20:05" %}} - chapter 4 um and other passages besides in the New Testament this is kind of what we're talking about here so again  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8411" display="2:20:11" %}} - going to read some of the ichus passages here um so uh I'll read some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8417" display="2:20:17" %}} - paragraph and then we'll go from there as we have the last couple of times so when we talk about God's life we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8423" display="2:20:23" %}} - saving the lives of his creatures is a natural consequence of God's truth and faithfulness so out of the intrinsic  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8429" display="2:20:29" %}} - veracity and trustworthiness of his character God honors his gracious and merciful promise to restore us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8435" display="2:20:35" %}} - himself and thereby to eternal life delivering us from the condemnation of death accre to us in our sinful state so  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8442" display="2:20:42" %}} - we say that he is faithful to that promise he made right recognize these words gracious corresponding to love and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8449" display="2:20:49" %}} - merciful corresponding to Justice when God promised to restore us to himself as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8454" display="2:20:54" %}} - he did Adam and Eve in the Proto evangelium that giving of animal skins  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8459" display="2:20:59" %}} - to Adam and Eve in the garden at the end of Genesis chapter 3 God kept that promise he redeemed them from Death the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8466" display="2:21:06" %}} - consequence of their sin um right the condemnation of death occuring to us in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8471" display="2:21:11" %}} - our sinful State we just talked about this we spent a long time talking about how the consequences of sin or death  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8477" display="2:21:17" %}} - even Eternal death and separation from God so in doing so he has not failed to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8483" display="2:21:23" %}} - resolve the competing demands of his goodness and love on the one hand with those of his Holiness and Justice on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8489" display="2:21:29" %}} - other as evil suggests he must and again tying it back to the Cross we say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8494" display="2:21:34" %}} - this is because God has found a way in accordance with his character to eliminate the wall of sin and consequent  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8501" display="2:21:41" %}} - wrath which separates us from him he has taken down the barrier of Separation  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8507" display="2:21:47" %}} - that separates Humanity from himself and he's done so through the gift and sacrifice of his only son on our behalf  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8514" display="2:21:54" %}} - meaning that Jesus died and was judged in our place that we might have life um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8520" display="2:22:00" %}} - and so peace that other technical term here Shalom IR in Greek peace is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8526" display="2:22:06" %}} - biblical name for God's life-giving policy of reconciling us to himself on the basis of the work of Jesus Christ we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8533" display="2:22:13" %}} - accept and receive God's offer of Life peace and Reconciliation by accepting and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8539" display="2:22:19" %}} - our savior so no different than um how we receive forgiveness how we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8546" display="2:22:26" %}} - justified by accepting Jesus Christ and how we receive God's Redemption by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8551" display="2:22:31" %}} - accepting Jesus Christ so we are reconciled to God through our belief in  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8556" display="2:22:36" %}} - Jesus Christ and what he did for us um so uh hopefully that's a good enough  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8563" display="2:22:43" %}} - introduction here to get us talking about the subject here um but this idea of our fullness of life that we have um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8571" display="2:22:51" %}} - I think you might uh consider the passages in Scripture that talk about peace and joy these are characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8577" display="2:22:57" %}} - that we ought to possess as Christians uh that true life living in the power of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8583" display="2:23:03" %}} - the spirit that we ought to have by following Jesus Christ is that we ought to be set free from the shackles and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8589" display="2:23:09" %}} - bondage that characterize those who are enslaved to sin because we have the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8595" display="2:23:15" %}} - Spirit living within us that that springing up to us as a well of living water based upon the truth in the word  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8601" display="2:23:21" %}} - of God that is what we mean by the life that God gives us that peace and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8606" display="2:23:26" %}} - Reconciliation to him that we have through his truth um so uh a you want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8613" display="2:23:33" %}} - pick up from there yeah um get cut off yeah I think I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8620" display="2:23:40" %}} - started talking but I don't hearing H yeah uh how about could you contrast  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8626" display="2:23:46" %}} - life eternal life life with eternal death hear everyone but it doesn't seem like you can hear can you hear me okay I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8632" display="2:23:52" %}} - can hear you now yeah so Lisa just asked a question uh didn't mean it cut off what you were saying but it's a good  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8638" display="2:23:58" %}} - question so you want to say something and then we handle it or you want to just jump straight into the question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8643" display="2:24:03" %}} - uh well okay he seems to be having connection problems here Soh I tell you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8650" display="2:24:10" %}} - what aie um I'm G to go ahead and talk and answer Lisa's question and uh if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8656" display="2:24:16" %}} - can sort out the ction problems will certainly give you the mic at the earliest convenience so Lisa's question  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8663" display="2:24:23" %}} - here was um can we contrast life with spiritual life with spiritual death um I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8669" display="2:24:29" %}} - think kind of as it relates to what we've been talking about here uh fundamentally spiritual death  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8675" display="2:24:35" %}} - corresponds with with lies it corresponds with not believing the truth  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8681" display="2:24:41" %}} - of what Jesus has done for the world um and um I think this kind of gets back  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8686" display="2:24:46" %}} - into what we were talking about with uh God's forgiveness of our sins uh being just uh is that when God gives us life  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8695" display="2:24:55" %}} - he does so um out of out of Truth out of his faithful promise to restore us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8701" display="2:25:01" %}} - himself um he he he doesn't do it just because he arbitrarily promises things but there's weight behind the promises  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8708" display="2:25:08" %}} - of God because of his character because he's perfect and so when he promises to do something that thing is sure and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8715" display="2:25:15" %}} - certain it's not like humans who can be kind of flaky sometimes when God says he's going to do something God will do  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8721" display="2:25:21" %}} - it and he does it not arbitrarily you know it's not like he promised to do it and therefore he did it even though it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8727" display="2:25:27" %}} - not fair he did it on the basis of his sacrifice so okay Lisa's question about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8732" display="2:25:32" %}} - contrasting this to spiritual death when we live um a life kind of infected by  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8738" display="2:25:38" %}} - death infected by sin um you know our sin nature within us we are separate  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8744" display="2:25:44" %}} - from God and part of this life that we're talking about here is not uh people would take this and this is I  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8750" display="2:25:50" %}} - don't want to say just an English thing I I bet the connotation very across language but we are really talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8756" display="2:25:56" %}} - fullness of Life on that Hebrew word that we're talking about here Shalom is more than just being alive it's more  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8763" display="2:26:03" %}} - than just consuming air in your lungs and eating food and sleeping and our bodily functions as humans it is like  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8770" display="2:26:10" %}} - the idea of truly living of having that peace that reconciliation between us and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8775" display="2:26:15" %}} - God and when you think about it unbelievers who are dead in their sins are dead men walking they don't have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8783" display="2:26:23" %}} - quickening of the Holy Spirit to give meaning to their lives um I know I talked about this I have that other  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8789" display="2:26:29" %}} - series up on my site going through uh sr4 Satan's World System talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8794" display="2:26:34" %}} - the vanity of the world one of the benefits we have as Christians is that everything we do has Eternal meaning and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8801" display="2:26:41" %}} - purpose behind it we are working out the kingdom of God here in the world we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8807" display="2:26:47" %}} - being used as instruments in the hands of the almighty and so everything we do has meaning and purpose um as contrasted  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8814" display="2:26:54" %}} - to those who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ where for them they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8820" display="2:27:00" %}} - already dead in their sins the things that they do are not contributing to God's kingdom they don't have peace with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8826" display="2:27:06" %}} - God they don't have reconciliation they don't have freedom in the truth I don't know if I need to keep  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8832" display="2:27:12" %}} - going on and elaborating at least that you can tell me if that's good enough but um it is night and day difference um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8839" display="2:27:19" %}} - and I think It ultimately boils down to what we are talking about is not just  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8845" display="2:27:25" %}} - you know breathing air and eating food we are talking about the spiritual aspect of this we are talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8851" display="2:27:31" %}} - truly being alive being connected and one with God through our belief do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8856" display="2:27:36" %}} - do you see it I mean everybody talks about this but that that Matrix movie and the right peel I can't remember if  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8862" display="2:27:42" %}} - it's the red peel or the blue peel or whatever you to see things more realistically  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8867" display="2:27:47" %}} - you think it's more something like that well uh so even Matrix aside this has been a thing in Philosophy for a long  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8873" display="2:27:53" %}} - time and yes aie I could hear you um when you asked just now um uh there  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8879" display="2:27:59" %}} - Plato's allegory the cave talks about this um and the metaphor used there is actually light and darkness um also  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8886" display="2:28:06" %}} - commonly comes up in scripture um the the binary contrasts here but  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8892" display="2:28:12" %}} - um so is is that what we're getting at yeah I mean you could view it that way for sure um like we are alive because of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8901" display="2:28:21" %}} - the truth we have right um so in Plato's allegory of the cave this corresponds to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8906" display="2:28:26" %}} - not being chained in place looking at a cave wall but actually being out in the world where the there is actually light  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8913" display="2:28:33" %}} - for us as Christians to use that metaphor that is us actually believing spiritual truth having our eyes opened  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8919" display="2:28:39" %}} - and living in it as opposed to being chained in place in Satan's World System  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8924" display="2:28:44" %}} - um and that's getting kind of back to the John 8 verse talking about how the truth sets us free is that we won't live  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8932" display="2:28:52" %}} - fully we will not have complete fullness of life without belief in Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8938" display="2:28:58" %}} - um can you guys hear me now yeah I can hear you so I don't know how much you caught  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8945" display="2:29:05" %}} - of what we were just talking about leis had asked a question uh comparing Spirit like the life we have spiritually with  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8952" display="2:29:12" %}} - spiritual death um and so we were talking about that a little bit um okay so spiritual life and spiritual death um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8960" display="2:29:20" %}} - we know that uh that no we lost him again ah how sad  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8969" display="2:29:29" %}} - um you can't hear me well we couldn't for a second um I mean you said  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8975" display="2:29:35" %}} - spiritual life and spiritual death and then kind of cut off after that um and we can't hear you now either um I I tell  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8983" display="2:29:43" %}} - you what having connection issues um maybe maybe we'll just keep going here  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8990" display="2:29:50" %}} - sort this out Lisa have we have we addressed uh what you were asking more again yeah I do want to give Audi a  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="8996" display="2:29:56" %}} - chance to talk but it's hard if it keeps cutting out um all right well I tell you  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9002" display="2:30:02" %}} - what I'll finish this off here it's unfortunate that we're having connection issues um but hello hello yeah we can we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9010" display="2:30:10" %}} - can hear you but I mean the last times you've you've been talking and then you've just cut out um yeah can't hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9017" display="2:30:17" %}} - you now if you're talking yeah yeah something is wrong I don't know okay um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9022" display="2:30:22" %}} - well we'll finish off here um I think we have been through uh the greater part of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9028" display="2:30:28" %}} - what there is to say on this particular matter um so uh because of our  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9034" display="2:30:34" %}} - understanding of the importance of spiritual truth to give meaning to our lives uh to truly let us walk as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9041" display="2:30:41" %}} - ought in Freedom as Christians um again passages I like to support the concept of what we're talking about John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9047" display="2:30:47" %}} - 6 where Jesus talks about him being the bread of life John chapter 4 where we talk about uh the truth of the word of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9054" display="2:30:54" %}} - God being this this spring welling up to Living Water within us right I mean empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9060" display="2:31:00" %}} - of course um these are the things this is what we mean by life when we're talking about life we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9066" display="2:31:06" %}} - spiritual life about being made alive spiritually with God as opposed to spiritually Dead uh through our sin and  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9074" display="2:31:14" %}} - not being uh kind of connected to god um so that is the concept of of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9081" display="2:31:21" %}} - have been talking about here with this idea of God is life because God wants that for all of his creatures even those  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9088" display="2:31:28" %}} - right now who are not willing to turn to him he has given them that option to  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9093" display="2:31:33" %}} - turn to him receive forgiveness for their sins on the basis of the blood of Christ and live these full lives doing  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9101" display="2:31:41" %}} - that which he has prepared for them um you know something else uh comes to mind here is uh in Ephesians chapter 2 uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9108" display="2:31:48" %}} - after right after the very famous verses to talk about us being saved by grace through faith we have verse 10 that says  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9115" display="2:31:55" %}} - that we've been created in Christ Jesus to do good works uh which God prepared in advance for us to do we have jobs as  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9121" display="2:32:01" %}} - Christians again this is getting back to that whole meaning we have a place that we fill in the body of Christ and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9128" display="2:32:08" %}} - gives everything we do spiritual value um that's kind of what we're talking about by being alive and all of this um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9136" display="2:32:16" %}} - from top to bottom is it's all about the truth of God um as contained in the Bible in Jesus The Living Word of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9143" display="2:32:23" %}} - like John chapter 1 talks about um talks about how Jesus is the Divine logos um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9149" display="2:32:29" %}} - the word who became flesh and dwelt Among Us um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9155" display="2:32:35" %}} - so all right well certainly more we could say there but I think that's where we will uh that's where we will close  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9161" display="2:32:41" %}} - out discussion on this section and uh we'll return with the summary of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9166" display="2:32:46" %}} - we've been talking about in this lesson in just a sec  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9172" display="2:32:52" %}} - here all right so that's where we are going to wrap up now uh this discussion that we've been in in this lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9177" display="2:32:57" %}} - talking about God's perfect character so we started out by uh talking about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9183" display="2:33:03" %}} - introduction uh or sorry in the introduction talking about God's idea uh God's moral perfection the idea that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9191" display="2:33:11" %}} - is without flaw he is the greatest that human Minds can possibly comprehend he  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9196" display="2:33:16" %}} - has moral perfection um in in a way that we're supposed to emulate as Christians so Matthew 548 says that we're supposed  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9203" display="2:33:23" %}} - to be perfect just how our father in Heaven is perfect we talked about uh the Greek word teos there is the adjective  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9209" display="2:33:29" %}} - meaning perfect and it has this sense of completion that maybe doesn't come through as much in that English uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9216" display="2:33:36" %}} - English word here that is the sense of perfect as being full and complete um  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9221" display="2:33:41" %}} - and that is what God is in every moral uh sense um he is completely morally  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9227" display="2:33:47" %}} - perfect um and in that that naturally leads into uh essential characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9232" display="2:33:52" %}} - of God God is good um the antithesis of evil God is Holy he has to be must be  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9239" display="2:33:59" %}} - separate from Evil we talked a little bit about how these things are actually kind of subtly different is that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9244" display="2:34:04" %}} - being good in like an ontological sense is a bit different than him needing to be separate from Evil um you know having  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9251" display="2:34:11" %}} - to condemn evil um we also talked about how God is faithful and true his promises are sure and certain and then  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9259" display="2:34:19" %}} - we spent a good bit of time uh in the bridge section talking about how all of these things translate into God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9264" display="2:34:24" %}} - sovereignty as de jur ruler of the Universe um the one who on account of  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9270" display="2:34:30" %}} - his moral perfection has the authority to judge moral creatures so that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="4okunpItA7w" time="9275" display="2:34:35" %}} - humans and angels in the universe for their actions so we made all these sub
