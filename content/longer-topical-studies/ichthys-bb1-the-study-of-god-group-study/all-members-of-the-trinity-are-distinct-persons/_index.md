## Summary {#summary}

This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is only one person (merely displaying three modes or aspects of Himself).

God is three in person, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are distinct persons rather than manifestations of a single, multifaceted person.

Heresies of the past which have challenged the distinct personalities of members of the Trinity include modalism (the idea that Christ and the Spirit are mere "modes" of the Father's personality), and docetism (the notion that Christ only seemed real and was in reality merely a phantom of sorts representing the Father's plan). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons.

{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1" display="00:01" %}} - all right guys so in the next lesson of our study of the Trinity here going through Bible basics part one theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="9" display="00:09" %}} - we are going to be talking about how all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons so in terms of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="17" display="00:17" %}} - essential points we're going to be going over we're going to be introducing this General Point uh talking about how even  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="23" display="00:23" %}} - though God is one in essence it does not mean that the Trinity is only one person merely displaying three modes or aspects  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="31" display="00:31" %}} - of himself um and so that is the point that we are making here um and if you recall we had discussed how the practice  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="39" display="00:39" %}} - that we are going through right now is kind of talking about what the Trinity is in terms of what it is not and so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="46" display="00:46" %}} - this particular aspect um or this particular point in that uh sort of way of thinking about things that we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="54" display="00:54" %}} - organizing our study with uh is basically making the point that God is not just one one being God is three  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="61" display="01:01" %}} - distinct well I gotta be very careful how I say this God is one in essence so he is one being that's what one in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="66" display="01:06" %}} - essence mean but he has three persons um God is not one person um so if you recall the general definition of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="75" display="01:15" %}} - Trinity that we argue for is three in person one in essence or one in essence three in person and this is defending  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="82" display="01:22" %}} - the three in person part and so uh we don't have quite as many verses this time as we did in uh the last section  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="88" display="01:28" %}} - going over all three MERS of the Trinity being God we just kind of have a one for most of these points here but we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="96" display="01:36" %}} - going to be talking about how the father is a unique person is own right for he's distinct from the son the son's unique  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="102" display="01:42" %}} - person's own right for he's distinct from the father and the Holy Spirit is a unique person in his own right because  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="108" display="01:48" %}} - he acts as a distinct person so these are the points that we're going to be going over as we establish uh The Wider  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="114" display="01:54" %}} - point that just because God is one in essence does not mean that the Trinity is only one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="123" display="02:03" %}} - person so when we say that God is one in essence but not one in person um kind of what we're getting at here is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="134" display="02:14" %}} - God uh sorry is that all three members of the Trinity are distinct rather than all being manifestations of a single  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="142" display="02:22" %}} - multifaceted person so um typically in theology um you'll hear this referred to as modalism the idea that the son or the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="152" display="02:32" %}} - spirit are somehow just modes of God um so uh that believe is is down here right here modalism um there's another one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="162" display="02:42" %}} - docetism the notion that Christ only seemed real and was sort of a phantom of sorts representing the father's plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="169" display="02:49" %}} - probably not not quite as common um something that you might come up against in terms of the Trinity it is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="176" display="02:56" %}} - historical heresy relating to uh this particular point that we are making here but by far most common challenge to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="184" display="03:04" %}} - proper understanding of the Trinity is this idea of modalism that Christ and the spirit are just modes of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="189" display="03:09" %}} - father's personality rather than being separate persons in their own right um and just to take a step back and talk a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="196" display="03:16" %}} - little bit about why do we even have to do this it's because it's really hard to think about how United the three members  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="204" display="03:24" %}} - of the Trinity are without getting the notion that they're one person and the reason for that is because for as humans  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="210" display="03:30" %}} - if you take three people and you stick them together and even if they agree on so many things they do not have the sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="219" display="03:39" %}} - of unity that the Trinity has um the Bible's very clear about that human beings we don't share an Essence we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="225" display="03:45" %}} - not one in the same being even people like identical twins right um so the scientist would say that they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="232" display="03:52" %}} - identical genetic code yet it's very obvious to us as humans that they are not the same they don't have the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="239" display="03:59" %}} - way will if you will um so they don't have the same human spirit is what we would say um they are separate beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="246" display="04:06" %}} - very obviously separate beings because they choose different things um they do not have that Unity of will that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="254" display="04:14" %}} - said is having and so why we kind of have to spend some breath arguing this point that we're making here is because  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="260" display="04:20" %}} - God is described as having one Essence being perfectly United in will and yet not just being one person and so we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="269" display="04:29" %}} - to spend some time on that not one person thing because for us as humans we don't have a good analog in the human  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="275" display="04:35" %}} - world for this because anytime you have multiple persons you do not have the unity of will that God has said to have  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="281" display="04:41" %}} - and so it's why it's just kind of hard for us to kind of metabolize and why it's worth spending some time talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="287" display="04:47" %}} - about it's not just because there were some people in the past who didn't believe this and and you were trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="293" display="04:53" %}} - lead everyone away in heresy or whatever it's it's not as if this is just a historical thing that we're kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="298" display="04:58" %}} - covering because gwiz some people in the past were wrong it's because it is actually difficult for us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="304" display="05:04" %}} - conceptualize in our head properly what it means for God to be three in person but yet have that Unity uh uh unity in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="312" display="05:12" %}} - action that the Trinity manifests so this is the topic that we're going to be covering here Audie do you have initial  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="320" display="05:20" %}} - thoughts on this point that we're going to be making here before we jump right into establishing it for each member of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="326" display="05:26" %}} - the Trinity not really I think we can okay great so picking up we are going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="337" display="05:37" %}} - talking about how scripture is very clear that the father is a unique person in his own right because he's distinct  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="344" display="05:44" %}} - from the son so I did kind of mention how we don't have as many passages um given as support here for the last point  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="351" display="05:51" %}} - that doesn't mean that these are any less certain uh truths that we ought to believe it's just just we don't we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="358" display="05:58" %}} - haven't listed as many here here um so the passage that we are going to be using here to support the notion that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="363" display="06:03" %}} - the father is unique in his own right because he's distinct from the son is this passage from Daniel chapter 7 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="370" display="06:10" %}} - 13 so I'll go ahead and read this and then we'll talk about it a bit so Daniel 7113 says I was looking during my vision  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="377" display="06:17" %}} - of that night and behold with the Clouds Of Heaven one like a son of man was coming up and he approached the Ancient  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="384" display="06:24" %}} - of Days that is the father and they brought him before him well first him is Son of Man second hym is the Ancient of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="393" display="06:33" %}} - Days so why are we using this to establish that the father is separate from the son is because the son of man I  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="402" display="06:42" %}} - mean I suppose you have to do some interpretation to get there um now Daniel is one of those eological texts  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="408" display="06:48" %}} - this is this is specifically prophetic here um but the son of man is Jesus Christ um when you interpret it when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="416" display="06:56" %}} - interpret it correctly that's definitely who the son of man is um so the son of man is Jesus Christ the son in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="422" display="07:02" %}} - Trinity and the Ancient of Days when you interpret it correctly um again I suppose you have to do some L work to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="428" display="07:08" %}} - get there but the Ancient of Days is very clearly the father um and so how can the son come before the father if  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="437" display="07:17" %}} - the son is the father it just makes no sense to say that um this doesn't stop people from saying it but they're just  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="444" display="07:24" %}} - wrong is the thing um because no matter how they try to explain this it always ends up getting all twisted and messed  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="451" display="07:31" %}} - up because it just doesn't fit with what the text is saying how can you have one being who comes before himself in two  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="459" display="07:39" %}} - separate forms it just that's not how that's not how we say a being has that Unity right  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="468" display="07:48" %}} - um so how is one being split in actually two separate beings uh you know like for example when we face when we Face  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="476" display="07:56" %}} - ourselves in the mirror we understand that's just the reflection of light we aren't actually two separate beings but  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="481" display="08:01" %}} - what you would have to argue that God is one person it has two separate aspects of himself here is that there are one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="491" display="08:11" %}} - being kind of manifesting in two ways at the same time which is kind of the very definition of what we would call  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="498" display="08:18" %}} - different persons right um so uh I don't know maybe I'm not doing a very job in terms of like philosophical jargon  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="506" display="08:26" %}} - saying the right things in like a formal flow of logic but that's the idea here that's why we say the son cannot be the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="514" display="08:34" %}} - father because it just doesn't make sense given what this passage says aie would you like to add any points to what  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="520" display="08:40" %}} - I've started with um Can can you hear me yeah I can hear you can you all hear me yeah I can hear you can you hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="530" display="08:50" %}} - us okay um so uh I don't I don't I don't think there is much to say actually in the previous discussion we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="541" display="09:01" %}} - were having I think um many of those passages actually present this same discussion uh father being unique in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="550" display="09:10" %}} - own right being distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit um that's actually how we know  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="558" display="09:18" %}} - because as you read through the Bible you keep seeing these things that don't make sense when you think of God as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="565" display="09:25" %}} - single as a single person in his personhood you know some things that are said of him wouldn't uh line up then um  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="576" display="09:36" %}} - so that we see that the father uh is demonstrated to be a person um by himself that makes sense the passage in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="586" display="09:46" %}} - Daniel 713 um may not be very popular among Believers but it's um there are many things in that Gem of a story  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="596" display="09:56" %}} - including how the Leake of fire is formed formed and all of that stuff but critically there was one who was like a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="604" display="10:04" %}} - son of man who was brought to this Ancient of Days we know that the son of man being spoken of there was the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="610" display="10:10" %}} - Jesus himself and um the the ancient of these is is presented as being separate from this son of man so yeah it there  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="623" display="10:23" %}} - are other passages too in the Bible that that lead us to these um appreciations that um the father is a unique person  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="632" display="10:32" %}} - separate from the other two members of the um Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="638" display="10:38" %}} - yeah all right well that's where we'll do as I say just a single passage here for each member so this is the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="646" display="10:46" %}} - being distinct from the son um next we're going to talk about how son is distinct from the Father which you kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="651" display="10:51" %}} - of get from this one we'll look at another passage in just a moment so just as we talked about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="661" display="11:01" %}} - the father's distin from the son well kind of it goes both ways but we're going to look at another passage here  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="667" display="11:07" %}} - also on this particular uh Point saying that the son is unique person for he distinct from the father so uh for this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="675" display="11:15" %}} - we're going to look at Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 um it says behold I have arrived in the scroll of your book it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="682" display="11:22" %}} - written about me to do your will oh my god um so and we open up more of the surrounding in context here in Hebrews  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="690" display="11:30" %}} - chapter 10 uh Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 is where we are uh so the person speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="697" display="11:37" %}} - here is Christ because that's what verse 5 in Hebrews chapter 10 says so I'll actually go ahead and read this whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="701" display="11:41" %}} - passage it says uh chapter uh chapter 10 verse 5 therefore when Christ came into the world he said sacrifice and offering  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="708" display="11:48" %}} - you did not desire but a body you prepared for me with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased then  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="715" display="11:55" %}} - I so I being Christ said then I said here I am it is written about me in the scroll I have come to do your will my  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="724" display="12:04" %}} - God so how would we say it makes sense for  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="731" display="12:11" %}} - Christ because Christ is the one Speaking here um to speak about so actually interestingly this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="740" display="12:20" %}} - NIV um in the translation here which I suppose comes from ichus we have a y  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="749" display="12:29" %}} - it might be pronoun there I could go check the Greek I suppose but basically either way I'm sorry that was just me  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="756" display="12:36" %}} - getting curious um the point being is that it's very clear that Christ is saying that he came into the world from  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="762" display="12:42" %}} - the father's will right the will of another we would say um although of course there's one you know the unity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="769" display="12:49" %}} - the members of the Trinity means that when things happen they all will it because of that Unity but um this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="775" display="12:55" %}} - another passage supporting that idea that the personhood of the members of the Trinity sort of is just essential to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="784" display="13:04" %}} - make the passages make sense because as soon as you start trying to argue that Jesus Christ is simply an aspect of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="792" display="13:12" %}} - father what does this passage in Hebrews chapter 10 even mean if you believe that um and uh you know more to the point if  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - we were supposed to understand it that way a lot of parts of the Bible just become really impenetrable um so so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="809" display="13:29" %}} - there is a sort of uh risk we would say to trying to apply aam's razor to interpretation large because there are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - some points of biblical truth that are very complicated um so I'm going to use as a smear word here this is not a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="825" display="13:45" %}} - positive term I'm going to say that things that seem really esoteric or mystical as in all people throughout  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="832" display="13:52" %}} - history have like misinterpreted this passage and only I have the correct interpretation when people say that sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="838" display="13:58" %}} - of thing especially if it bounds into something that we would sort of call mysticism or this idea of very special  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="846" display="14:06" %}} - knowledge this this new way of looking at something and yet no matter how much you press them they can't like formulate  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="852" display="14:12" %}} - it in terms of propositions it's always sort of vague and hard to understand and and impenetrable is a good word yeah you  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="860" display="14:20" %}} - shouldn't believe that sort of thing right and here the point I'm making is that trying to interpret this passage  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="866" display="14:26" %}} - trying to interpret the passage that we had just read um in the previous section talking about Daniel chapter 7 trying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="874" display="14:34" %}} - interpret these passages with the father and the son being literally the same person it just doesn't make sense um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="882" display="14:42" %}} - people like I said they may try to talk circles around you and explain thus and so and and you know basically and not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="890" display="14:50" %}} - that I have had very many serious debates uh among Christians or you know people at least claiming Christ about  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="896" display="14:56" %}} - this because to be perfectly honest nowadays there aren't that many Mists I mean they're out there AI has has said  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="902" display="15:02" %}} - that he's actually had serious conversations about it before but what I'm trying to boil this down to is that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="908" display="15:08" %}} - when you try to interpret these passages while making them the same person it just makes everything so complicated and  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="917" display="15:17" %}} - so not straightforward so that everything requires explanation that it is just obviously not the right  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="922" display="15:22" %}} - interpretation um so uh hopefully that's not too handwavy um I think this is quite clear just how I think Daniel  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - chapter 7 is quite clear um aie do you have further thoughts on this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="937" display="15:37" %}} - [Music] um not quite I think that this passage um always appealed to me  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="945" display="15:45" %}} - because of um how uh in uh the reference the the part of the law that this was taken from um we have a different  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="957" display="15:57" %}} - rendering there yeah instead of um uh okay it was from the PS actually in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="965" display="16:05" %}} - the sum it said that my did it say a body you had prepared for me my ears you have pierced that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - what it said and uh when you when you look at the part of the law that it was referencing it says that a servant who  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="982" display="16:22" %}} - says that he does not want to leave you no he he is very happy to be part of your family and he wants to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="991" display="16:31" %}} - remain so for the rest of his days um you're supposed to pierce his ear uh with an all um and that would be uh like  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1001" display="16:41" %}} - a way to tell anyone who sees him that he belongs to a particular house even though he's not related to that house by  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1008" display="16:48" %}} - Blood maybe something of that sort so um what we see is this uh a body you have prepared for me that used to stump me a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1017" display="16:57" %}} - bit but then when you relate these two ideas it really comes down to um you get um this body that I have is meant to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1028" display="17:08" %}} - used in service to you so like this person opted for Lifetime slavery this Jew who had his ear pierced  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1041" display="17:21" %}} - um here the Lord Jesus is is expressing the same thing which of course I think should be rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1051" display="17:31" %}} - obvious as to uh how it it says that um he is not the father that he's a separate person from the father I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - there are still those who do believe that since it is God anything is possible so he can um be a sleeve to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1066" display="17:46" %}} - himself but then yeah I I don't see how that fits yeah I I will say I don't know why I I must have missed it or something  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1074" display="17:54" %}} - because the slide obviously says your will right I I must have just misspoken earlier  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1080" display="18:00" %}} - because this has your too and I checked the Greek this is the second person pronoun here your um it makes the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1087" display="18:07" %}} - argument real straightforward because the will that Christ discusses In this passage here is not his right it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1096" display="18:16" %}} - my will it's your will right second person it literally you know how we have persons in grammar it is using a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1104" display="18:24" %}} - separate person in grammar um hence more than one person in the Trinity right um yeah you know like it it's it's really  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1112" display="18:32" %}} - that simple um because if Christ can speak of the father's will as being not my will not his own  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1122" display="18:42" %}} - will they simply cannot be the same person um it's it's I I don't know what I was getting at earli I must have just  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1130" display="18:50" %}} - like been looking at something that was wrong but it is the second person pronoun which makes that argument real  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1136" display="18:56" %}} - straightforward um yeah yeah all right now as we've said before um just as in the other section these are not the only  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1144" display="19:04" %}} - passages we could pull to support these things we're just kind of making the points as we go along here so this was  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1150" display="19:10" %}} - establishing that the son is distinct person from the father right we've done that um so we did that in Daniel chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1157" display="19:17" %}} - 7 we were I guess kind of coming at it from the perspective of the father Hebrews chapter 10 coming that from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1162" display="19:22" %}} - perspective of the sun next we will be talking about the spirit and the spirit's distinct personhood  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1172" display="19:32" %}} - so now we're going to talk about how the holy spirit is a unique person is well in his own right for he acts as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1179" display="19:39" %}} - distinct person so the passage this time again we got one verse per these points here uh just in this part of the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1187" display="19:47" %}} - passage this time Romans chapter 8 verse 26 um says the spirit helps us in our weakness in a similar way for we do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1195" display="19:55" %}} - know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself self intercedes for us also with anguish supplications with  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1201" display="20:01" %}} - which words cannot express right um so passage this actually comes right before the uh uh for knowledge you know like  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1209" display="20:09" %}} - the end of Romans chapter 8 I think it's like verses 29- 31 talk about you know like uh God's for knowledge and calling  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1217" display="20:17" %}} - justifying glorifying that that passage but talking about how the spirit prays for us he intercedes for us and when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1225" display="20:25" %}} - pray you know we we pray to the father in the name of Jesus Christ I could go find verses to support that what I just  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1231" display="20:31" %}} - said um but when we pray we pray to God um addressed to the Father the spirit is interceding for us how can the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1242" display="20:42" %}} - intercede to the father shall we say if the spirit is the father you see what I'm saying like it  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1250" display="20:50" %}} - again this is one of those situations where you start trying to argue for a modalist position and it just doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1257" display="20:57" %}} - make sense because you ask someone what does that mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1262" display="21:02" %}} - precisely like basically redu you ad absurdum is what we would call it in terms of logic if you say that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1269" display="21:09" %}} - spirit is the father and the father is the spirit and that there is you know one God and one God means one  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - person what does this verse mean then if you interpret it that way and you will just never get a satisfying answer out  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - of someone if you press them on that because there isn't a satisfying answer like they can go through all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1290" display="21:30" %}} - gymnastics as I've been arguing and you know um you know it might have been good if I went and actually tried to find an  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1296" display="21:36" %}} - argument here so that it wasn't just me saying oh some people actually say this but you know like I had a representative  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1302" display="21:42" %}} - argument from one of them but the point that I have been making and uh maybe maybe it sounds like I'm straw Manning  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1308" display="21:48" %}} - here but the point is if people try to do that presumably they have some way to say that this verse doesn't mess up  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1315" display="21:55" %}} - their interpretation but no matter what they say it's going to be overly long and complicated and just obviously not  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1321" display="22:01" %}} - right is the point now uh because again uh I feel like the spirit is one of those that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1329" display="22:09" %}} - sometimes it's perhaps the one that we struggle the most with um when we talk about aspects of the Trinity um I pulled  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1336" display="22:16" %}} - up this verse this is one that we talked about um at the very beginning of the last lesson as well when we were talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1341" display="22:21" %}} - about how all three members of the Trinity are God here um so this is when Jesus is asking the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - uh for the holy spirit so he's telling the people in John chapter 14 uh verse 16 so I will ask the father and he will  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1356" display="22:36" %}} - give you another Advocate to help you and be with you forever that Advocates the spirit Jesus is asking the father to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1364" display="22:44" %}} - give another person I feel like if there's one verse in the Bible that makes clear that there are three persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1372" display="22:52" %}} - in the Trinity it' be this verse right um for the reasons that we been saying before right if if there's one person in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1382" display="23:02" %}} - the Trinity what in the world would this verse even mean then yeah one person I am asking myself to send myself how does  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1391" display="23:11" %}} - that make sense right yeah um yeah of course uh as we said there are those who would essentially say that because he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1400" display="23:20" %}} - God we won't understand one mysteries of God and all of that stuff it doesn't have to make sense to us but um like we  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1410" display="23:30" %}} - said this this is not something we see in isolation the rest of the Bible speaks to it but this is a demonstration  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1417" display="23:37" %}} - of the um uh personhood of the of the spirit as a separate thing from the personhood of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1424" display="23:44" %}} - the father and the personhood of the spirit of of the son sorry so he essentially says just as we we we the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1433" display="23:53" %}} - Bible tells us that that he intercedes that is he prays for us he prays on our behalf he makes requests on our behalf  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1442" display="24:02" %}} - to who to himself just as Paul as Stephen pointed out that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1451" display="24:11" %}} - is insane to think that he would be making requests to himself but some people are fine with uh Insanity when it  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1460" display="24:20" %}} - comes to God because they believe that because he's God nothing makes sense with him and everything is acceptable of  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1468" display="24:28" %}} - everything makes sense no matter how ridiculous it is but this is the Bible's one of the Bible's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1474" display="24:34" %}} - demonstrations of uh the personhood of the spirit as a separate thing from the personhood of the other persons of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1480" display="24:40" %}} - Trinity yeah yeah I mean I would say not to get off on too big a tangent but we are right to hold philosophy at arms  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1489" display="24:49" %}} - length a bit I know we talked about this in some of the the first lessons in this series here in in bb1 theology uh making  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1497" display="24:57" %}} - the point when people split hairs about nature and Essence and what essential characteristics are and things like that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1502" display="25:02" %}} - right would God be God if he wasn't ex right or you know what I'm talking about like that sort of thing where  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1510" display="25:10" %}} - philosophers they they they make certain boxes about things and I'm not trying to bash philosophers here right um uh or  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1518" display="25:18" %}} - philosophy large as a practice of being Analytical in how we think about the world and things like this but we as  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1524" display="25:24" %}} - Christians we submit to the Bible not to the Wom of professional secular philosophers and there is something to  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1533" display="25:33" %}} - be said for not swinging too far the other way which is submitting to what we would call a mystical understanding  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1540" display="25:40" %}} - where you know for lack of a better word God's elogical but we just say well that's just that's fine you know because  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1547" display="25:47" %}} - we can't understand him um this is the whole you know I'm trying to think about the right way to say this you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1554" display="25:54" %}} - perhaps uh certain very well educated atheists might might think that Christians are kind of dumb right they  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1560" display="26:00" %}} - are anti-education they can't talk intelligently about topics because they just say oh have faith and then they  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1567" display="26:07" %}} - never even articulate their own positions um I am not trying to bash our brothers and sisters here because the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1574" display="26:14" %}} - Bible says we are we ought to have childlike Faith right for lack of a better way of putting it childlike faith  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1581" display="26:21" %}} - is not dissertations in analytic philosophy right um you see what I'm saying um yeah so we don't need to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1588" display="26:28" %}} - ashamed of being like well the Bible says so so there um you know however where I'm going with this is that this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1598" display="26:38" %}} - idea that we have to believe nonsense because that's what it is right fundamentally what we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1604" display="26:44" %}} - here where these people say that the spirit intercedes to himself it's just nonsensical on the face of it it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1609" display="26:49" %}} - a contradiction on the face of it right um yeah so we ought to have childlike faith in the Bible but we don't turn off  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1617" display="26:57" %}} - our brains to believe whatever someone says the Bible says um you know you know Audi and I have had a conversation quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1626" display="27:06" %}} - recently actually I'm talking about in interpretation when we talk about we need to take the Bible at its word right  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1633" display="27:13" %}} - and we need to be reasonable um uh you know I I won't pull in the whole context of that P other  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1639" display="27:19" %}} - discussion but basically when we interpret the Bible we have to interpret it reasonably and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1646" display="27:26" %}} - point here is that how just how other people get offended when you take their words out of context and you try to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1653" display="27:33" %}} - their words mean something that they obviously don't mean well we need to stake down our flag and call people out  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1659" display="27:39" %}} - when they do that to the Bible too right because there are certain lines that we just can't cross when it comes here and  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1667" display="27:47" %}} - saying somehow that the spirit interceding to himself because the spirit is is the father and the father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1674" display="27:54" %}} - the spirit it's one of those lines where when when people start going there I mean like you got to stick down  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1682" display="28:02" %}} - a flag somewhere right and like I said God does not submit us he God does not have us believe nonsense um despite that  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1689" display="28:09" %}} - being a strawman argument that atheists might use against Christians is that I don't know we don't think things through  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1695" display="28:15" %}} - maybe we don't hold intellectually rigorous positions their straw man in  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1699" display="28:19" %}} - Christianity is what's happening there um yeah yeah all right so um perhaps more we could about um holy spirit's  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1709" display="28:29" %}} - distinctness as well so we talked about Romans 826 we pulled up this verse in John chapter 14 as well talking about uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1716" display="28:36" %}} - Jesus Christ uh you know asking the father to send the spirit and how honestly this verse kind of hits all  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1722" display="28:42" %}} - three of them right is that the only way in which this verse makes any sort of sense is if all three of them are  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1727" display="28:47" %}} - persons um because otherwise you have you know the son who is the father asking the father for to send the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - right if you view them all in terms of one person it just what does that even mean right it doesn't make sense it  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1741" display="29:01" %}} - contradicts itself on the face of it it's why that interpretation is unworkable um  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - so that's probably where we'll wrap our discussion here of the idea that the spirit is well is a unique person in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1756" display="29:16" %}} - own right for he acts distinctly right he intercedes for us before God when we pray which wouldn't make any sense if he  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1765" display="29:25" %}} - wasn't a distinct person so as promised this lesson a little bit shorter here not going to go belver too  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1777" display="29:37" %}} - much of what we talked about uh but just in review we have talked about how all three members of the Trinity are their

{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1791" display="29:51" %}} - essence that does not mean that the Trinity is only one person but it has as three persons and we've talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1799" display="29:59" %}} - these passages that just on the face of it clearly support this idea that even though God has this Unity of will this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - single Essence um he cannot be the same person because then how could the son of man approach the Ancient of Days as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1816" display="30:16" %}} - separate person how could um Jesus Christ in Hebrews chapter 10 be talking about the father's will right um how uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1826" display="30:26" %}} - things about Christ were written in your will um and how could the Holy Spirit here be interceding for us when we pray

{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1859" display="30:59" %}} - clear conclusion that even though God is one in essence God is not one in person um and so that's where we'll wrap this  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1868" display="31:08" %}} - and uh in future lessons we will be examining a couple more of these uh of these statements about what the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="eKpw0_W78Sc" time="1875" display="31:15" %}} - is not so that once we finish it all we will have that clear understanding of exactly what the Trinity is
