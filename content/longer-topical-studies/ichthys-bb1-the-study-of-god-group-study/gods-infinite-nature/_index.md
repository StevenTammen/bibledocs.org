### Introduction: God's infinite nature {#introduction-god-s-infinite-nature}

Key point: God's nature is infinite. *Infinite*.

God's infinity – infinity in every way and according to any conceivable true standard – is a clarifying concept, *illuminating His abilities*.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Spiritual {#god-is-spiritual}

<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-spiritual">God > Is spiritual</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#angels-are-subject-to-matter">Angels > Are subject to matter</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's being transcends the physical universe. He is not limited or bounded by material issues or concerns. God is not subject to matter in any way. God is not made of matter – God created matter and employs it however He desires.

<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-eternal">God > Is eternal</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's being transcends time. He is not limited or bounded by temporal issues or concerns. God is not subject to time in any way. God is not constrained by time – God created time and employs it however He desires.

{{% video-only-note %}}

Were prophets actually transported into the future (i.e., plucked from one point in the "river of time" and dropped at another as an observer), or did they just have visions of the future (i.e., see visions of it like a movie)?

### God is Immeasurable (in a spatial sense) {#god-is-immeasurable-in-a-spatial-sense}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-immeasurable">God > Is immeasurable</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God's being transcends space. He is not limited or bounded by spatial issues or concerns. God is not subject to space in any way. God is not confined by space – God created space and employs it however He desires.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Unique {#god-is-unique}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-unique">God > Is unique</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-de-facto-ruler-of-the-universe">God > Is *de facto* ruler of the universe</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

Uniqueness comes from God's infinite nature. No one else in the universe can reasonably be compared to Him. He is absolutely unique within His own creation, and therefore the one Person to whom all honor is due.

From the standpoint of His *transcendence* of the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His spirituality, eternity and immeasurability. From the standpoint of His *supremacy* within the physical universe, He is unique by virtue of His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence.

<!-- --- -->

| Essential Quality                               | Manifesting in creation as                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being spiritual (rather than bound by matter)   | Omnipotence (God may affect material creation however he pleases)                                                     |
| Being eternal (rather than bound by time)       | Omniscience (God knows everything in creation from beginning to end, and even what could have been)                   |
| Being immeasurable (rather than bound by space) | Omnipresence (God is ever-present in creation: as far as the East is from the West, nothing can separate us from God) |

While we may not be properly able to fully grasp God's true nature since we are small, finite beings bound by spacetime, it should nonetheless be clearly apparent that it is not possible for any created creature to compare with the Creator. Even creatures far more powerful than ourselves---Satan and the other angels---are bound and limited in ways God is not, leaving God completely alone and unique in His transcendence of and supremacy within the physical universe.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Omnipotent {#god-is-omnipotent}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omnipotent">God > Is omnipotent</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is all-powerful, irrespective of matter. He can effect anything He desires in the material realm, and nothing can transpire apart from His will. Therefore there is no deed (nor was there ever, nor will there ever be) which God is unable to do, small or great.

#### "Could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" {#could-god-create-a-rock-so-big-even-he-couldn-t-lift-it}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#apologetics">Apologetics</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

You may have come across something like "So, could God create a rock so big even He couldn't lift it?" This is (supposedly) pitting two aspects of omnipotence against each other: God's ability to create anything He wishes *ex nihilo*, and God's strength.

People argue that the two superlatives mandated by omnipotence contradict each other. Supposedly, if God cannot create an object too heavy for Him to lift, he is not omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to create anything. And likewise, if there would exist some object that God could create but was unable to lift, then He also would not be omnipotent, because an omnipotent creature would be able to lift everything. "See!", they say, "either way, He cannot do something; therefore, He is not omnipotent!"

We can let people who wish to not believe on account such an argument go on their merry way. We needn't take them up on the debate. For it is *obvious* that God can both create whatsoever He wishes, and also manipulate His creation in whatever ways He wishes. The idea of a material object He cannot create is definitionally impossible, and so too a material object He cannot manipulate. Put differently, there is no such thing as an object He could create but not lift, or an object He could lift but not create. So the entire objection is circular by assuming such a thing can exist to begin with. That is, they've already put God in a box from the very beginning, and then only proceed to smugly knock down nothing but a straw man.

<!-- --- -->

My counsel would be to avoid all such nonsense. God can do "it", whatever "it" may be. Always. We follow אֵל שַׁדַּי, *El Shaddai*, God Almighty, He who was, and is, and is to come---He who holds the strings of the universe in His hands, and can create or annihilate galaxies in the blink of an eye. And we'd better fear that power and majesty as we ought, to keep our lives in perspective. We are tiny compared to the vastness of the Earth, much less our solar system, much less our galaxy, much less the universe. But God is even bigger (infinitely bigger), and could snuff them all out in the blink of an eye if He decided to. *That* is the kind of power in view when we speak of God being omnipotent. Not that He will actually snuff out the universe on a whim, but that it would be nothing for Him to do so, since He is in complete control of matter, time, and space... and things only exist because *He* causes them to exist.

### God is Omniscient {#god-is-omniscient}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omniscient">God > Is omniscient</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is all-knowing, irrespective of time. He can effect anything He desires in the temporal realm. Therefore God knows (has always known, and always will know) everything, the end from the beginning. As the Everlasting One (Ps.90:2; 90:4), His knowledge of every event that ever has or will or even could occur within His creation is comprehensive and absolute.

<!-- --- -->

#### God's knowledge of hypotheticals {#god-s-knowledge-of-hypotheticals}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#omniscience-includes-knowledge-of-hypotheticals">Omniscience > includes knowledge of hypotheticals</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#molinism">Molinism</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#middle-knowledge">Middle knowledge</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

The "could occur" bit is important. God's knowledge of all possible hypotheticals is sometimes discussed in terms of so-called ["Molinism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism) and "middle knowledge". I prefer to discuss it independent from all the baggage there, however.

Here's an example: since the Bible says that God will never test us past what we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), then that implies He knows what we would and would not be able to bear. He wouldn't be able to perfectly test us to refine our faith unless He knew all information like this.

Same deal with perfectly disciplining us, and plenty of other matters besides. Put simply, God's perfect foreordination of all things logically requires that He know everything about all potential paths in the mind-bogglingly complex decision tree that spans the history of the entire universe. It has always puzzled me why people would ever think to argue against such a notion, but alas, some people do for some reason. Perhaps it is because such a belief requires one to appreciate how truly "big" and unlike us (with our very finite perspective) God really is?

<!-- --- -->

For now, you should mostly ignore the fact that some people have again put God in a box in their minds, and content yourself with the sure confidence that God knows everything---absolutely everything, inclusive of our free-will decisions before we even make them---and is so infinitely wise as to have perfectly mapped out all of creature history before the universe was even created. There is a Perfect Divine Plan being worked out around us, and God knows very well what He is doing, rest assured.

<!-- --- -->

### God is Omnipresent {#god-is-omnipresent}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#god-is-omnipresent">God > Is omnipresent</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

God is ever-present, irrespective of space. He can effect anything He desires in the spatial realm (Job 26:7). Therefore God has the ability (has always had, and always will have) to be anywhere and everywhere, local and universal.

Of particular note is that this means God sees all. Nobody can sneak anything past God, and on that Great Day of Days, all will be revealed. It also means it is completely futile to try to run away from God. Like Jonah, we will find that no matter where we go, God and His purposes for us will always be there too.

{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="0" display="0:00" %}} - all right guys so this week we are picking up and we are going to be talking about God's infinite nature so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="6" display="0:06" %}} - last time we met we were talking about the essence of God in general uh so I don't have the slides up but we did talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="13" display="0:13" %}} - about how God is The Great I Am God is being uh we talked about uh light and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="19" display="0:19" %}} - Glory as manifestations of God's resplendant and we also talked about kind of the difference between nature  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="26" display="0:26" %}} - and Essence and uh kind of waved our hands a bit and said you know what but we for the purposes of this study are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="32" display="0:32" %}} - just going to be explaining who God is from the Bible and we're going to not worry so much about some of the technical terms and the arguments that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="39" display="0:39" %}} - philosophers have about these things we're just going to talk about God in terms of how the Bible explains him to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="45" display="0:45" %}} - us and so picking up on that line this week we're going to be starting out talking about God's infinite nature um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="52" display="0:52" %}} - So within the study of IUS we have God's infinite nature and God's perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="57" display="0:57" %}} - character are kind of the subheadings that we're going to be going through uh next in our sequence here and this week  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="62" display="1:02" %}} - is God's infinite nature so here are the sub points that we're going to be going through we're going to start out just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="68" display="1:08" %}} - the general introduction that he's infinite and what that means for us going to talk about how God is spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="74" display="1:14" %}} - Eternal and immeasurable in a spatial sense and then we're going to talk about how these things uh essential attributes  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="80" display="1:20" %}} - of God make God unique um and he's also unique because of how they manifest in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="86" display="1:26" %}} - creation and so that's where the omnipotence the omniscience and the omnipresent comes from and so that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="91" display="1:31" %}} - general structure of what we're going to go through here today and um as we go um this middle section here about how God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="98" display="1:38" %}} - is unique this is the transition between these first three which are the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="104" display="1:44" %}} - so-called essential qualities of God um this is uh uh you know God independent  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="109" display="1:49" %}} - from creation if you will and then the latter three are how these qualities manifest in how God relates to creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="116" display="1:56" %}} - and so that's kind of what the middle section there uh is is going  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="123" display="2:03" %}} - through all right so that first point for us to make is simply this that God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="129" display="2:09" %}} - nature is infinite and this is actually a decidedly difficult concept for us as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="134" display="2:14" %}} - humans to understand because we as humans are not infinite now God's Infinity which is infinity in every way  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="141" display="2:21" %}} - and according to any conceivable true standard so it's not like God's just really big he's not a super creature  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="148" display="2:28" %}} - he's not you know something that we can honestly contextualize we don't have a reference for a being that is truly  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="155" display="2:35" %}} - infinite but God's Infinity for us uh is a clarifying Concept in that it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="160" display="2:40" %}} - illuminates his abilities so uh when we talk about God's character which is what we'll come next in the study we'll talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="166" display="2:46" %}} - about how God's perfect character illuminates his motives um the reasons behind how he operates in creation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="173" display="2:53" %}} - God's Infinity illuminates his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="178" display="2:58" %}} - abilities so the first thing that we're going to be talking about is about how God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="184" display="3:04" %}} - spiritual and so in being spiritual God's being transcends the physical Universe he's not limited or bounded by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="192" display="3:12" %}} - material concerns or issues God is Not subject to matter in any way he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="197" display="3:17" %}} - made of matter because God created matter and employs it however he desires  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="202" display="3:22" %}} - and so this is the first of these essential qualities that we're talking about so uh spiritual Eternal and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="208" display="3:28" %}} - immeasurable those are the three we're going through first and this one is talking specifically about matter and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="214" display="3:34" %}} - when we say matter we're talking about the things that are created in the material universe so the world and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="220" display="3:40" %}} - everything in it uh the second and third Heavens if you will that's how the Bible describes them so uh you know our solar  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="226" display="3:46" %}} - system the galaxies everything in the universe that has substance is what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="231" display="3:51" %}} - we're getting at here and when we say that God is spiritual God is separate from that he is separate from that which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="238" display="3:58" %}} - has been created um the stuff if you will in the universe because he is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="243" display="4:03" %}} - completely spiritual being now one thing that I thought maybe it would be good for us to talk about just a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="250" display="4:10" %}} - is how God being spiritual is different than Angels being spiritual and so aie  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="256" display="4:16" %}} - um I know that's a little bit jumping ahead in the Systematic Theology uh Dr L has an entire section of the study  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="261" display="4:21" %}} - dedicated to Angels but do you have anything you want to say on regards to God's spirituality versus uh Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="268" display="4:28" %}} - which aren't quite the same as us and how they relate to SpaceTime yeah I do um I want to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="276" display="4:36" %}} - first of all that uh if anything is created it's made of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="283" display="4:43" %}} - stuff and the Lord is not created so he's not made of stuff so when we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="290" display="4:50" %}} - in terms of spirit we might be feeling like this is other than material and there is some  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="297" display="4:57" %}} - sense to that but it is not strictly correct MH because everything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="304" display="5:04" %}} - exists is made of stuff so it is all really material in a sense of speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="311" display="5:11" %}} - and that's actually why we're not looking forward to a smokey hazy sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="318" display="5:18" %}} - heaven or oops well we'll see if he comes back in a sec yeah it's it's smok  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="324" display="5:24" %}} - sort of heaven or the new universe a place where you know things are not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="330" display="5:30" %}} - Material that's not the idea we we saw that um Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="335" display="5:35" %}} - could take in food even though the Lord could as well you know when he um came  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="342" display="5:42" %}} - to visit with Abraham with the angels we saw that they could interact with matter and um physical matter and uh they could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="351" display="5:51" %}} - eat food and they could have all of these experiences we have Genesis 6 that talks about um The Rebel Angels um creat  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="359" display="5:59" %}} - the Nephilim with human women and all of that so that suggests to us that they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="365" display="6:05" %}} - made of a different sort of material than the rest of the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="371" display="6:11" %}} - is but it is still material that's the idea but the Lord when we say that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="377" display="6:17" %}} - Lord is spiritual we're necessarily saying that he is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="382" display="6:22" %}} - Material so the his spirituality is essentially in contrast to the Universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="390" display="6:30" %}} - the spirituality of the Angels is not in contrast to the universe it's in contrast to other material things other  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="397" display="6:37" %}} - physical things and um the way that the Bible presents it it keeps using the word that is also translatable as wind  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="406" display="6:46" %}} - we find that kind of issue with different um modern translations instead  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="411" display="6:51" %}} - of saying Spirit they would say wind and in some places instead of seeing not just modern translations I think even the KJV have that issue so in some  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="418" display="6:58" %}} - places you will see spirit in some places you would see wind because the word is not really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="424" display="7:04" %}} - distinguishable from each other the idea here is that just as wind does have an  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="429" display="7:09" %}} - effect on matter around it and yet you can't see it you can't really touch it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="435" display="7:15" %}} - it's not tangible that's how these creatures are so the spirituality of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="441" display="7:21" %}} - angels is in contrast to the other material Creations in the universe in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="446" display="7:26" %}} - fact um this is one way to look at it that unless man had been created angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="453" display="7:33" %}} - would have been the only thing of their kind in the entire universe every other thing had either Flesh and Bones if they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="460" display="7:40" %}} - were animals or they had a physicality to them that the Angels did not have it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="466" display="7:46" %}} - classed them separately from everything that existed so when Man was created note what the Bible says that he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="472" display="7:52" %}} - made a little lower than the Angels that's actually speaking to the fact that man was more like all creatures of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="478" display="7:58" %}} - the Earth that he was like the Angels so the spirituality of the Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="485" display="8:05" %}} - was essentially to set them apart from everything else that God had made and spirituality of God is to contrast God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="492" display="8:12" %}} - as a thing with the universe as a and so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="498" display="8:18" %}} - was the essential point that we're trying to draw a contrast between here and I think you did a good job explaining it that God's spirituality is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="505" display="8:25" %}} - completely distinct from anything that's created so humans are creatures angels are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="511" display="8:31" %}} - creatures both have been created by the Creator who is external to that which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="517" display="8:37" %}} - created um and maybe that sounds really technical but I think ai's done a good job explaining uh some of the points  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="523" display="8:43" %}} - just a couple other things to bring up in regards to this um Angels this physicality aspect is one of the reasons  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="530" display="8:50" %}} - why Genesis 6 was a thing it's one of the reasons why Angels um inhabit some  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="536" display="8:56" %}} - of the creatures in the gospels you know like going into the pigs um it uh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="541" display="9:01" %}} - know that that word actually gets transliterated a lot of different ways but the gines or the gines um uh at that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="549" display="9:09" %}} - particular instance is angels have this desire for physicality um Dr lugan Bill  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="554" display="9:14" %}} - um uh discusses this in various parts of his studies and the other point that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="559" display="9:19" %}} - wanted to bring up in regards to this is that before humans were even created in the universe uh the universe had been  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="566" display="9:26" %}} - created and was inhabited by angels and so this is the the sons of God as they're called I believe it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="573" display="9:33" %}} - in job somewhere you know talks about how the sons of God Sayang during creation right a angels have this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="580" display="9:40" %}} - materiality to them even though they are different than us but God is completely separate all right so with that I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="586" display="9:46" %}} - we're gonna take a question here and we'll pick back up in a second all right so a good question that we just got was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="592" display="9:52" %}} - well if angels are already kind of of this different state than us why are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="598" display="9:58" %}} - they kind of uh uh looking down so to speak and if humans were created a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="603" display="10:03" %}} - little lower than the Angels um aie was quoting that passage then why do angels want that um this physical experience um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="612" display="10:12" %}} - and I I think my answer just to start us off and like I said I'll certainly let others jump in is just that uh Angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="619" display="10:19" %}} - want things they don't have and so if angels don't have this the sensory  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="624" display="10:24" %}} - experience the actual physicality now um I should note that it's a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="630" display="10:30" %}} - dangerous for us to get too off in the Weeds about saying well Angels did this for this and that reason you know the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="635" display="10:35" %}} - Bible doesn't talk so explicitly about some of this um Dr lell has done a good job on this explaining um hypotheses for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="643" display="10:43" %}} - the motivations here um so for example uh before the universe was uh destroyed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="649" display="10:49" %}} - and remade um he hypothesizes certain things about angels kind of messing with the genetic code of the creatures the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="657" display="10:57" %}} - the fauna on the pre reconstruction Earth um as well as um Angels Desiring  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="663" display="11:03" %}} - the bodies of of you know things generally speaking as it shows up in the gospels and uh my initial answer would  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="670" display="11:10" %}} - just be because it's something that they lack and sort of Grass Is Always Greener sentiment is because of that that's why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="677" display="11:17" %}} - even though uh you know having this this Mortal coil to use that phrasing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="683" display="11:23" %}} - the KJV does makes us weaker and less powerful we still have that sensory EXP  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="689" display="11:29" %}} - ER and that's something that the Angels wanted to experience themselves iose aie  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="694" display="11:34" %}} - do you have thoughts to on top of that I think you really actually said what the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="700" display="11:40" %}} - issue is every time we're tempted the idea is that what we don't have is better than what we do have um so why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="706" display="11:46" %}} - would they want it well because they didn't trust that God gave them what they should have that what they had was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="713" display="11:53" %}} - good and that God had you know put them in the right state for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="718" display="11:58" %}} - them to be and that's why this whole fight we have is a fight of Faith a fight of trusting that what God does is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="725" display="12:05" %}} - good that that he loves us and that what he gives for us gives to us is good for us it's exactly what happened with um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="732" display="12:12" %}} - Adam and Eve they had the Fountain of wisdom himself coming to walk with them  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="738" display="12:18" %}} - every evening they had a perfect garden everything was great but somehow they thought that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="747" display="12:27" %}} - one thing that God said that that's not good for you was what they needed more  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="753" display="12:33" %}} - than anything once Satan suggested it to them so the fact that anyone wants  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="761" display="12:41" %}} - something no matter how wise powerful smart or whatever they might be does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="766" display="12:46" %}} - in any way indicate that that thing was actually better for them than what they had it's not at all a way to think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="774" display="12:54" %}} - things so yeah the Angels wanted it simply because they could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="779" display="12:59" %}} - not because there was anything to suggest that they what what they had was not Superior to what they were looking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="785" display="13:05" %}} - for I mean to a certain extent this is the irrationality of sin I know I've  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="791" display="13:11" %}} - explained it this way I don't want to get super philosophical about it but when the Bible calls Jesus the Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="797" display="13:17" %}} - logos you know that word meaning reason I mean it means many things in Greek but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - God's universe is ordered and logical and fundamentally all sin is irrational  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="807" display="13:27" %}} - and so the question of why did the angelss seem to desire something that's lower than the estate that they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="813" display="13:33" %}} - currently possess it seems kind of like mad right well why does Satan rebel  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - against God why do any of us rebel against God um maybe that isn't the most  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="824" display="13:44" %}} - intellectually satisfying of answers but it really does get to the heart of this I think is that just because angels are uh you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="833" display="13:53" %}} - bigger and smarter than us so to speak doesn't mean that they don't suffer from the same spiritual blindness than we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="838" display="13:58" %}} - and that's spiritual blindness causes us to do things that a more objective third party Observer would say are irrational  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="845" display="14:05" %}} - um and in this particular case this is one such instance where by all accounts elect Angels don't have this same uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="852" display="14:12" %}} - desire temptation to do all of this and so it's it's just transgression of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="858" display="14:18" %}} - created order in a matter that we would term irrational um so I think that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="863" display="14:23" %}} - kind of the the way in which we ought to approach this issue um not so much that the angels are doing it for any great  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="870" display="14:30" %}} - purpose like there there there isn't more behind it in a plan as it's something that they don't have that they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="876" display="14:36" %}} - want and uh sin is always in some sense irrationally breaking God's natural  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="883" display="14:43" %}} - order yeah yeah I would say that I actually find the answer pretty intellectually satisfying myself because  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="890" display="14:50" %}} - all it all it says really is we always want some because we think it's better than  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="896" display="14:56" %}} - what we have and that that's just true we have that experience all the time it's very rare for people to go I want  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="903" display="15:03" %}} - something and that something is a change of of the order the state in which you are and it's not because as you don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="910" display="15:10" %}} - think that what you want is better than what you're what you currently have I mean it's we have too many if we were to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="918" display="15:18" %}} - to go into all the experiences that demonstrate this we probably spend the whole night from this and there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="923" display="15:23" %}} - need for that so we could move on at I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - all right so with that I think that's where we're going to stop on our initial discussion of how God being spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="936" display="15:36" %}} - means he is set apart distinct from the universe uh he transcends it in a way  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="942" display="15:42" %}} - that even angels do not even though angels are above us in station for the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="947" display="15:47" %}} - time being as Hebrews talks about is that God even more than that because he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="952" display="15:52" %}} - is not a created being because he's not a created creature God is completely separate from matter and that makes him  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="960" display="16:00" %}} - unique in this characteristic as we will see for all of the other things that we talk about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="967" display="16:07" %}} - next all right so next we are going to be talking about how God is eternal and so what we just spent time covering was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - how God uh is not bound by matter or the material Universe uh because God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="979" display="16:19" %}} - spiritual and now we're talking about how God is not bound by time so God's being transcends time he's not limited  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="986" display="16:26" %}} - or bounded by temporal issues or concerns God is Not subject to time in any way God is Not constrained by time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - because God created time and employs it however he desires and so this is one of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1000" display="16:40" %}} - those things where again we as humans are just going to have a hard time wrapping our heads around exactly what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1006" display="16:46" %}} - it means to be outside of time because it's not a state in which we have any personal experience in uh plus when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1013" display="16:53" %}} - say something like before time even existed the concept of before is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1019" display="16:59" %}} - inherently wrapped up in time right um if we view time as kind of like a line then before is like more left on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1025" display="17:05" %}} - line well for a being that's outside of time there is no before there is no after because time is not something that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1033" display="17:13" %}} - that being is bound by and this is really hard for us to wrap in our minds um I would not feel discouraged if  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1040" display="17:20" %}} - thinking about this sometimes causes you to get confused because it confuses me um it's just not even something that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1047" display="17:27" %}} - honestly need to worry ourselves about to the greatest degree we just need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1053" display="17:33" %}} - understand that some of the concerns that test us and temper Us in life about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1058" display="17:38" %}} - not seeing how things are going to play out about this uncertain future about not knowing how the chips are going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1064" display="17:44" %}} - fall God is Not constrained in that same way God's plan sees from the very  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1070" display="17:50" %}} - beginning to the very end of of the history of the universe it sees everything uh in in an instant God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1076" display="17:56" %}} - planned everything before the initial events of creation were ever set in motion and that is very foreign to our  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1083" display="18:03" %}} - limited way of thinking because we think on imperfect information but God does not and so this is what we mean by God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1090" display="18:10" %}} - being Eternal is that he sees the beginning from or sorry the end from the beginning he is simply not bound by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1097" display="18:17" %}} - constraints of time that we are a you have points you want to bring up in reference to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1103" display="18:23" %}} - this yeah sure um I think the very first thing that we want to know is what time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1109" display="18:29" %}} - is uh physicists are having a hard time actually explaining what time is especially since um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1116" display="18:36" %}} - Einstein basically blew everybody's mind when he made it clear that time was not a constant when he discovered that time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1124" display="18:44" %}} - was not the constant it was thought to be well time is really the measure of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1130" display="18:50" %}} - change and God doesn't change so obviously there was nothing to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1137" display="18:57" %}} - measure that change if time exists for a being that does not change it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1142" display="19:02" %}} - actually a nonsensical concept it really does not mean anything you know so um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1151" display="19:11" %}} - the first thing I would say is that the very meaning of time does not apply to God since it's actually the measure of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1156" display="19:16" %}} - change and um the second thing I would say is that God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1162" display="19:22" %}} - eternality is explained entirely by the fact that he is that which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1169" display="19:29" %}} - so there is no was with God in the sense of him because if you look to God's past  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1178" display="19:38" %}} - what you see is the same thing that you see now and if you look to his future  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1183" display="19:43" %}} - what you see is the same thing that you see now there is no transformation in the state of his existence but that does  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1190" display="19:50" %}} - not mean that because God is outside and and when we use that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1197" display="19:57" %}} - that word it's it we have to construct we have to create mental constructs for trying to make sense of God so when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1204" display="20:04" %}} - say outside of time we have this feeling like there is a box in which time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1210" display="20:10" %}} - operates and God exists outside of it but God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1216" display="20:16" %}} - acting he is doing things and when he does  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1222" display="20:22" %}} - things there's a question um there's a question how how does his doing things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1230" display="20:30" %}} - interact with the fact that time exists outside of or that time does not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1237" display="20:37" %}} - affect him is he not actually doing something create basically changing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1242" display="20:42" %}} - something and uh that is where I would bring in the analogy of uh the software engineer and his and his um software  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1250" display="20:50" %}} - he's he's changing states without actually being affected in any way by those changes he might put create an an  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1258" display="20:58" %}} - input in a particular program he has um designed and he gets a certain output he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1263" display="21:03" %}} - might make changes the state of the program and all of that but he himself is not in any way Changed by it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1270" display="21:10" %}} - so we we the creatures that God made have had to have a context within which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - we exist he does not need context he does not need anything in himself he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1282" display="21:22" %}} - perfectly complete so eternity in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1287" display="21:27" %}} - is is just like um uh would I say space eternity is like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1295" display="21:35" %}} - an expression of him rather than something that that he exists within  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1302" display="21:42" %}} - that is it it it is his own type of time no eternity is actually like this is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1308" display="21:48" %}} - aspect of myself that's what it is so likewise for us to appreciate God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1316" display="21:56" %}} - eternality we we first of all appreciate first that he does not change and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1322" display="22:02" %}} - therefore time is meaningless to him to the quality of his existence there's no change to measure but in order to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1331" display="22:11" %}} - interact with us and to bring about the state of things that he wants he has  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1337" display="22:17" %}} - created time to allow us to exist exist within a certain context and to work out  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1344" display="22:24" %}} - what he has intended so time for us it is for our  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1350" display="22:30" %}} - benefit otherwise we couldn't make sense of life right and I think fundamentally  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1355" display="22:35" %}} - the point is that time is created God created time right it's not like it's some aspect within which he works like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1362" display="22:42" %}} - you said um because it is fundamentally tied up with existence like you brought up time is something that was created as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1370" display="22:50" %}} - part of the creation of the universe you know bringing back up the physicist there's this thing relativity is this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1375" display="22:55" %}} - idea of space is linked to time the two things are not unrelated it is very much  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1381" display="23:01" %}} - part of creation and again we have a really hard time understanding exactly what that means for God not having that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1388" display="23:08" %}} - but it is just very important for us to emphasize that God is not bound by it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1393" display="23:13" %}} - because God created it um and really I think that is more or less the gist of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1399" display="23:19" %}} - what we have to say on this matter is simply that even though it's hard for us to understand and conceptualize God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1405" display="23:25" %}} - separate from time um and that means that how he approaches the sequence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1410" display="23:30" %}} - events that happen in the material universe is very fundamentally different from how we as fly night creatures who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1416" display="23:36" %}} - don't have that don't have that externality to time can approach things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1422" display="23:42" %}} - um all right uh good question here well observation question um so first off  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1428" display="23:48" %}} - angels are subject to time um we spent a good bit of the last uh point that we were discussing talking about how God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1434" display="23:54" %}} - spirituality is fundamentally different than angels and that angels are still material they're in the material  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1440" display="24:00" %}} - creation well so too with time Angels they don't see the future um so to speak they are not outside of time they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1447" display="24:07" %}} - within time space or SpaceTime time space isn't a word SpaceTime just how we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1452" display="24:12" %}} - are and so that makes them again more similar to us than they are to God in this even though Angels uh have  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1458" display="24:18" %}} - different capabilities than we do um uh they are different creatures with different Natures than we have they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1465" display="24:25" %}} - nonetheless still created creatures within SpaceTime and an interesting observation also related to this idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1474" display="24:34" %}} - how time works and and God's externality to it is this idea of future Prophecy in the Bible um and so uh sometimes it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1482" display="24:42" %}} - just people are told what's are are told what's going to happen uh God tells them  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1487" display="24:47" %}} - what is going to happen sorry um future events but when we have this case of Visions um so uh we might think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1495" display="24:55" %}} - John with the Book of Revelation for example was it just that John was given I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1501" display="25:01" %}} - know like a movie so to speak of what was going to happen in the future or was John actually transported into the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1507" display="25:07" %}} - future thereby seeing the events that were going to happen uh I I I don't want  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1512" display="25:12" %}} - to like punt on the question to me it sort of doesn't seem like the answer matters um because either way in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1521" display="25:21" %}} - Book of Revelation we are being given um this description of future events  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1526" display="25:26" %}} - whether that is John was simply given to see the manifestation of what would  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1532" display="25:32" %}} - happen or whether he was actually somehow transported picked up from um if you view time as a stream picked up from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1539" display="25:39" %}} - one place in the Stream and put in a futured place in the Stream and then brought back I don't think it really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1544" display="25:44" %}} - changes the the essence of the fact that the vision that Jon saw was the future  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1551" display="25:51" %}} - um Audie do you think that it has an impact should should we take a stand on  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1556" display="25:56" %}} - this yeah I I don't I don't think it really matters it's it's an interesting  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1562" display="26:02" %}} - question and uh there there are all sorts of interesting questions out there even with us me personally and pro  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1571" display="26:11" %}} - Robert has has also confessed to having questions of All Sorts that the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1576" display="26:16" %}} - does not actually give answers to uh I do remember how Ezekiel said that um he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1583" display="26:23" %}} - the spirit lifted him by the the locks of his head and um took him to such and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1589" display="26:29" %}} - such a place and he saw this and he saw that and all of that so it's almost like they were transported forward in time to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1595" display="26:35" %}} - see things happening as they unfolded now I don't really know or particularly  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1600" display="26:40" %}} - care the reason for that is this we know that God has control of time whether he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1607" display="26:47" %}} - can pick you up from the present and transport you to the Future so that you witness things happening or he actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1614" display="26:54" %}} - shows you things as they will happen in the future before they actually happen I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1620" display="27:00" %}} - don't think it makes that big of a difference we know that God controls  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1626" display="27:06" %}} - time he controls it and we have two um demonstrations in the Bible of God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1633" display="27:13" %}} - control of time he W time back when he was uh speaking to ahaz the king who was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1641" display="27:21" %}} - an unrighteous king of Judah who didn't want to listen to reason and uh Isaiah said well this is how God will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - demonstrate to you that what he has said will happen he caus the sun dial to go back 10° um then there was Joshua who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1656" display="27:36" %}} - was fighting um I think it was the amalekites he was fighting I don't remember that whom he was fighting  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1663" display="27:43" %}} - anymore but during that uh battle he basically paused time now how that could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1671" display="27:51" %}} - possibly happen that time would pause and everything would keep going as it was I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1678" display="27:58" %}} - go knock yourself out with the physics of it but it did happen that's what the Bible says so all of that tells us that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1686" display="28:06" %}} - God does have the power to do whatever he wants with time and as for space the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1693" display="28:13" %}} - Lord Jesus could show up at any place whenever he wanted after he rose from the dead and you couldn't keep him out  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1700" display="28:20" %}} - with locked doors so when you take all of that into account there is nothing too hard for the Lord he could totally  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1708" display="28:28" %}} - cause a profet to time travel but I'm not sure knowing that he did or didn't do it is going to really make that of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1717" display="28:37" %}} - difference to our understanding of the scriptures or of him we do know that his power is absolute so y I think that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1724" display="28:44" %}} - probably the best answer for us on this is just either way I it does not really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1730" display="28:50" %}} - affect the fact that God is in complete control of time um and it's not bad to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - ask questions what I would call questions of curiosity how how exactly does this work you know what does it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1741" display="29:01" %}} - mean for XYZ if the Bible doesn't talk about it um there are certain things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - that we just can't take hard firm positions on that doesn't mean that they aren't interesting in some respects but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1752" display="29:12" %}} - it also kind of means that maybe it's not something that we're given to know and that means that usually I would say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1758" display="29:18" %}} - as a rule of thumb it's dangerous to spend lots of time on these things just because uh not that there's anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1764" display="29:24" %}} - wrong being curious or asking questions but if it was something that we needed to know God would have given us  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1769" display="29:29" %}} - information on it right um simple as that so um I think it's a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1774" display="29:34" %}} - interesting question of were prophets actually transported into the future or did they just see visions of the future  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1779" display="29:39" %}} - how does that work uh who knows either way God is in complete control of the flow of time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1787" display="29:47" %}} - um so I think that's a good place for us here so just how God is in complete control of matter and uh all of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1793" display="29:53" %}} - material things in the universe God is in complete control of time because he is Eternal and separate from it and next  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1799" display="29:59" %}} - we'll be talking about the same deal except for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1805" display="30:05" %}} - space all right so uh as we just said next we're just going to be talking about the exact same sort of concept  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1811" display="30:11" %}} - that we have been with matter and time except now with regards to space so God's being transcends space he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1818" display="30:18" %}} - limited or bounded by spatial issues or concerns he's not subject to space in any way and again God is Not confined by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1825" display="30:25" %}} - space because he created it and employs it however he desires so we have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1830" display="30:30" %}} - same idea of God being the Creator the one outside of creation who has the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1836" display="30:36" %}} - strings uh in his hand so to speak and so the idea that God is somehow Bound by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1842" display="30:42" %}} - this thing that he himself made is just completely nonsensical on the face of it um and so AI brought up an example uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1850" display="30:50" %}} - when we were just talking about Jesus uh not being bound by space after the resurrection and so uh the the gospels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1857" display="30:57" %}} - are clear that the disciples were in a room with a locked door and then Jesus appeared among them um and so that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1863" display="31:03" %}} - just an one example here um but uh you know this is what we mean by God not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1869" display="31:09" %}} - being bound by space um also God uh can control things within space he can uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1876" display="31:16" %}} - you know do you know and and this is where it gets a little bit fuzzy if you squint you hard at the physics behind it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1882" display="31:22" %}} - so uh matter and space and time they're all related um in these equations that we don't need to go into but the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1890" display="31:30" %}} - is all of it is creation and God is not bound by his creation and if you were to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1895" display="31:35" %}} - summarize the three things that we've been talking about here matter time and space is that all of these things are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1901" display="31:41" %}} - part of creation and God is not part of creation God exists before creation um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1908" display="31:48" %}} - god well I I rather I should say God exists right that's what his nature is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1913" display="31:53" %}} - and God created what we now have around us and he's not part of it and that's really  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1919" display="31:59" %}} - the fundamental basis of all three of these is simply that God is not at all constrained by the things that constrain  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1926" display="32:06" %}} - Us in creation because he is not himself a created creature um you have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1932" display="32:12" %}} - specifically related to space to bring up AI um I I I don't think so but I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1938" display="32:18" %}} - think you uh you make a very a very solid Point once you say look we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1946" display="32:26" %}} - talking about that which isn't created and I I like to make a bit of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1951" display="32:31" %}} - difference between um the deity of the Trinity and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1957" display="32:37" %}} - the persons of the Trinity the reason I make that difference is this or the identity I think um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1965" display="32:45" %}} - identity of Trinity the identity of God and the deity of God the reason I like to make that difference is the thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1972" display="32:52" %}} - that makes a thing God is simply the isness of the thing the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1977" display="32:57" %}} - it just is there is no explanation for its existence there is no agent that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1986" display="33:06" %}} - that speaks to why it exists nothing made it and nothing can affect its  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1992" display="33:12" %}} - existence you can't change it in any way can't affect it in any in any way that quality of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="1999" display="33:19" %}} - deity once we understand it makes everything make all the sense in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2005" display="33:25" %}} - world because then it can't be creation creation does not possess that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2012" display="33:32" %}} - quality and space does not possess that quality because black holes for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2020" display="33:40" %}} - example there are weird things that happen we've been talking about the expans the expansion of of of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2028" display="33:48" %}} - universe because of how we are we are measuring um the red shifts I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2034" display="33:54" %}} - that's what they call it yeah it's red shift yeah so we're measuring those things that tell us that something is happening  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2041" display="34:01" %}} - to the very fabric of the universe in which we exist everything that we see  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2047" display="34:07" %}} - changes it and change is a response to something external to whatever is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2052" display="34:12" %}} - changing so if space itself is transforming then  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2057" display="34:17" %}} - space does not possess the quality of deity and that which possesses the quality of deity cannot be subject to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2063" display="34:23" %}} - anything that is subject to change MH so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2069" display="34:29" %}} - therefore we can we can comprehend all these arguments are essentially to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2074" display="34:34" %}} - look the Bible makes sense because when you think about it it makes sense that's it so well consistent like you said with  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2082" display="34:42" %}} - drawing this distinction between deity being fundamentally distinct from creation um and creation cannot be deity  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2091" display="34:51" %}} - on this account um you know it's sort of at least posted on the Forum you know I may get to that at some other point but this idea a that the universe is God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2099" display="34:59" %}} - complete garbage because the universe changes and God doesn't change like just on the surface of it it doesn't work  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2105" display="35:05" %}} - right um and that's because God is being God is unchanging as AI has just brought  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2111" display="35:11" %}} - up makes it fundamentally distinct from everything that is created in creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2116" display="35:16" %}} - um including space right um so uh that's a good that's a good place to end our  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2123" display="35:23" %}} - initial introduction to these so next we're going to be talking about how some of these attribut that we've discussed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2128" display="35:28" %}} - here so the fact that God's spiritual that he's Eternal and that he's immeasurable make God unique among  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2134" display="35:34" %}} - beings and so that's what we're going to turn to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2141" display="35:41" %}} - next all right so when we say that God is unique this kind of might seem like a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2146" display="35:46" %}} - no duh teaching well of course there's only one God right you know we don't believe in a Pantheon in fact there only  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2153" display="35:53" %}} - could be one God from a logical standpoint right um because if there are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2158" display="35:58" %}} - more than one well were they all equally existent you have all these other sorts of issues and uh interestingly like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2164" display="36:04" %}} - pantheons never seem to never seem to kind of handle that so well like do gods exist within other gods or they all kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2171" display="36:11" %}} - of if you squint hearted them enough they have what I would call uh existential logical issues with how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2178" display="36:18" %}} - work but not so for us because as we've just spent time discussing deity exists external to Creation God is not part of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2186" display="36:26" %}} - creation God is being he's existence he does not change and so all that to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2192" display="36:32" %}} - it should be sort of self-evident that well there's only one being like that and that being is God and nothing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2198" display="36:38" %}} - is created is at all like him because this characteristic of deity like AI has just pointed out that is what makes God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2206" display="36:46" %}} - unique um I mean among other things right it has all these consequences that we've been going through with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2211" display="36:51" %}} - spirituality the fact that God is eternal God is immeasurable and the manifestations of those things in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2217" display="36:57" %}} - creation which is what we'll look at next as we get through this section but the whole point is that all of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2223" display="37:03" %}} - things together mean that there is no one and nothing else like God um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2228" display="37:08" %}} - that's what we mean when we say that God is unique um it comes from God's infinite nature no one else in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2234" display="37:14" %}} - universe can reasonably be compared to him he's absolutely unique within creation even though God's not bound by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2241" display="37:21" %}} - creation right uh as a person who acts within creation no one has the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2246" display="37:26" %}} - properties that he has no one has his infinite nature and therefore he is the one person to whom all honor is due um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2254" display="37:34" %}} - as the deao ruler of creation by existential Fiat it's kind of a mouthful  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2260" display="37:40" %}} - but it's saying that on account of who God Is His Infinite nature the fact that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2265" display="37:45" %}} - he is the creator all creation owes him that honor and respect simply on account  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2272" display="37:52" %}} - of who he is um because of these attributes that he has right right we're saying that God's Infinity illuminates  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2278" display="37:58" %}} - his abilities that was kind of the intro slide that God is going on this they illuminate his abilities because of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2284" display="38:04" %}} - abilities because of his uniqueness he is the de facto ruler of the universe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2289" display="38:09" %}} - and so from the standpoint of his Transcendence of the physical Universe uh God is unique by virtue of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2295" display="38:15" %}} - spirituality eternity and immeasurability and so this is kind of going to be the bridge here and that's why this section at least to my  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2302" display="38:22" %}} - knowledge that's why Dr lug has laid out this section as he has is because we're now going to be going from these three  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2309" display="38:29" %}} - characteristics which are the essential qualities of God right God is these things um now to our minds we kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2316" display="38:36" %}} - have a hard time thinking of them external to the universe but these are the the qualities of God who make God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2322" display="38:42" %}} - who he is um kind of not in reference to the universe and now we're going to be shifting our attention um to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2330" display="38:50" %}} - manifestations of these qualities as they relate to God's actions within the universe within creation and so God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2337" display="38:57" %}} - transcends the physical Universe because he's spiritual um he's Eternal and he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2342" display="39:02" %}} - immeasurable but within how he relates to the physical Universe he is supreme  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2348" display="39:08" %}} - within the physical Universe in that he's omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent and those three if you think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2355" display="39:15" %}} - about them actually correspond to these other attributes that we've just gone over so God is omnipotent because he can  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2362" display="39:22" %}} - affect whatever he wants in the physical Universe with m matter because he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2368" display="39:28" %}} - external to it right he's not bound by the laws that govern the rest of matter in the universe because God created  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2373" display="39:33" %}} - matter same deal with omniscience if God sees the end from the beginning well of what consequences time to God and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2380" display="39:40" %}} - is why God knows everything because from the beginning to the end and even that which was not has not been the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2386" display="39:46" %}} - hypothetical so to speak God knows it all because God is external to time and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2391" display="39:51" %}} - the omnipresence well if you can't contain God in one place that's what it means that God is everywhere because God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2398" display="39:58" %}} - is simply not a created creature he's not bound by these these rules of the universe that govern all other created  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2404" display="40:04" %}} - beings now I made this chart here um uh the study doesn't have it this is just stuff directly out of the study and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2411" display="40:11" %}} - can be helpful you know visual a can be helpful for us kind of having an easier way to track some of the things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2417" display="40:17" %}} - we're talking about here so when we say that God is unique we say he's unique  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2423" display="40:23" %}} - because he's spiritual rather than being bound by matter and how that manifests in creation is that he's omnipotent God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2429" display="40:29" %}} - may affect material creation however he pleases and when we say that he's Eternal rather than being bound by time  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2436" display="40:36" %}} - that means that God's omniscient uh God knows everything in creation from beginning to end and even that which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2442" display="40:42" %}} - could have been um he's immeasurable rather than being bound by space and that manifests is him being omnipresent  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2449" display="40:49" %}} - he's ever present in creation as far as the East is from the West so nothing can separate us from God and the the love of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2456" display="40:56" %}} - God is kind of the scripture I'm paraphrasing there and so all this together means that while we may not be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2462" display="41:02" %}} - properly able to fully grasp God's true nature since we ourselves are small finite beings Bound by SpaceTime it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2469" display="41:09" %}} - should nonetheless be clearly apparent to us that it's not possible for any other created creature to compare with  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2475" display="41:15" %}} - the Creator um and that's simply because no other creature is outside of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2480" display="41:20" %}} - limitations like God is so even creatures far more powerful than ourselves so Satan and the other angels  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2486" display="41:26" %}} - they are bound and limited in ways God is Not and so that leaves God completely alone in and unique in his Transcendence  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2494" display="41:34" %}} - of and Supremacy within the physical universe and this right here this is why we say that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2501" display="41:41" %}} - unique so uh Audie do you have any points you want to say about kind of what we've gone through here um you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2508" display="41:48" %}} - this kind of bridge the transition between these essential qualities of God we've been going to and then how they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2514" display="41:54" %}} - manifest within creation yeah um the first thing I want to say about that is the reason that there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2522" display="42:02" %}} - even a a question or there is any any mention of God's uniqueness is that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2528" display="42:08" %}} - is actually the whole point of all the fighting so to speak the the war in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2536" display="42:16" %}} - creation because Satan essentially went why should he have it and I don't get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2542" display="42:22" %}} - have it and every sin that we commit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2548" display="42:28" %}} - everything that um all all the issues of sin that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2553" display="42:33" %}} - have arise from a heart that says why does God get to be God and I don't get  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2560" display="42:40" %}} - to be God because the idea is what makes him so special I can also make my own  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2567" display="42:47" %}} - choices I can also determine what I will be and we must remember that this is why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2574" display="42:54" %}} - we are in the image of God that we possess the ability to self-determine we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2580" display="43:00" %}} - have the ability to self-define so we can say this is what I want to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2585" display="43:05" %}} - relative to God that's what free will really is that we possess the ability to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2590" display="43:10" %}} - define or explain ourselves relative to God and because we possess that and this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2598" display="43:18" %}} - is exactly why the argument he just made for how there cannot be more than one God makes all the sense in the world  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2604" display="43:24" %}} - creature Rebellion is AB proof that there can only be one God because if there are more than one creation would  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2611" display="43:31" %}} - not exist there would be at loggerheads all the time and they would essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2617" display="43:37" %}} - either want to create multiple universes and if as long as they're in Conflict they cannot have this they can't let  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2625" display="43:45" %}} - anything else exist they would be locked in Eternal conflict forever but we know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2631" display="43:51" %}} - that there are three Persons Of God and these three Persons Of God are in perfect Unity and that is also proof for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2638" display="43:58" %}} - why there is one God because if they if they are all in perfect Unity they cannot be multiple gods in the sense of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2647" display="44:07" %}} - possessing multiple Wills multiple desires multiple projections  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2654" display="44:14" %}} - and expectations and whatnot the very essence of godhead of of deity is that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2661" display="44:21" %}} - am that which is not affected by anything outside of myself and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2666" display="44:26" %}} - more than one God exists they would have issues with affecting each other yeah I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2672" display="44:32" %}} - mean I almost don't think to a certain extent that we have to go worry ourselves with uh arguing against the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2678" display="44:38" %}} - concept because to some extent scripture is clear that there is one God right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2683" display="44:43" %}} - you know even Old Testament got that so I I'm not saying we can't talk about it it's just to us that's the important  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2689" display="44:49" %}} - part yeah we're not going into that the reason that this is actually raised is to explain the matter of the uniqueen of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2696" display="44:56" %}} - God while we're even talking about it that uniqueness is the point of all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2702" display="45:02" %}} - fighting we are having because as long as a creature can say I can be God too  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2710" display="45:10" %}} - then what's special about God and that's why that's why the Bible is shaped the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2715" display="45:15" %}} - way it is um I think I had a conversation yes I had a conversation with someone on my way back from church  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2721" display="45:21" %}} - today and I had to tell her I don't present and I don't believe that the Bible is a manual of in instruction so I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2728" display="45:28" %}} - don't teach you what to do and what not to do and what is right and what is not right I teach you who God is so that you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2735" display="45:35" %}} - see how different he is from you and from everybody else you get to know his plan so that you know exactly what he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2742" display="45:42" %}} - aiming to accomplish as a thing that's different from what you are aiming to accomplish and what everybody else is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2747" display="45:47" %}} - aiming to accomplish in other words I'm showing you the uniqueness of God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2752" display="45:52" %}} - that's the point that's the point Satan could say I will Ascend to and I will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2759" display="45:59" %}} - make my own place I will be like the most high as if you can be like him you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2767" display="46:07" %}} - are not like him not even remotely so and that's the point so like you said um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2773" display="46:13" %}} - all of these uh other qualities that came into play um they they essentially demonstrate his uniqueness and all sorts  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2779" display="46:19" %}} - of ways that is absolutely true they show his Transcendence over creation but more importantly they show his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2786" display="46:26" %}} - Transcendence over us that is me personally this is the difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2791" display="46:31" %}} - between me and God and this is why he gets to say what should be and I get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2798" display="46:38" %}} - say I'd like to go with you I agree with you I submit to what you want I will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2803" display="46:43" %}} - work with you to accomplish it because I don't know half the things you know you know everything and I don't have half  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2809" display="46:49" %}} - the power you have you you have all the power whatever you don't do doesn't get done I I can't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2816" display="46:56" %}} - um be everywhere at once to accomplish my this and and again look when he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2822" display="47:02" %}} - tested job these things are what he brought to bear he showed him look at the difference between me and you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2828" display="47:08" %}} - think you're so wise you think you're so smart that you can even judge me now would you can you do this can you do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2834" display="47:14" %}} - that do you understand this do you know that have you been here have you been there do you know where the the snow  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2841" display="47:21" %}} - comes from and all of that stuff he was essentially saying look at the the gulf the wide go between who you are and who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2847" display="47:27" %}} - I am and when you see that for what it is do you really think you can judge me  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2853" display="47:33" %}} - can you sit in Judgment of God so this is why we're interested at all in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2860" display="47:40" %}} - talk about God's uniqueness we're essentially saying it is impossible for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2866" display="47:46" %}} - there to be more than one God we are certainly not candidates for that other God that be and Satan is most definitely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2874" display="47:54" %}} - not a candidate for the other God that ought to be there is only one every other claim to deity to godhood is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2883" display="48:03" %}} - lie that's what this is about because they can never have these attributes  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2888" display="48:08" %}} - that we're talking about only a being who created what currently exists who's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2893" display="48:13" %}} - outside of it can have these attributes nothing that exists within creation can be spiritual truly like separate from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2901" display="48:21" %}} - creation right nothing that exists within time can be separate from time it just it doesn't make sense right it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2907" display="48:27" %}} - impossible and so this is the madness the existential futility of Satan's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2913" display="48:33" %}} - rebellion and uh you know as uh the satanic rebelling series on ichus talks  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2918" display="48:38" %}} - about this this idea that humans have about you know I am like God God needs  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2924" display="48:44" %}} - me that progression of self- delusion again the insanity of this as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2930" display="48:50" %}} - Audi is pointing out the reason why we talk about the uniqueness of God is because this this uniqueness that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2936" display="48:56" %}} - talking about it means that we we owe God God is the one who controls the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2941" display="49:01" %}} - universe and because of that he's the one with all the authority in the universe not us um we don't control the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2948" display="49:08" %}} - things like God does and for that reason God's uniqueness gives him de facto  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2954" display="49:14" %}} - rulership and Supremacy within the universe because among other things no one can oppose him not really uh even  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2960" display="49:20" %}} - Satan's plan Satan's only dancing in the palm of God's hand because Satan can do nothing that God does not allow to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2967" display="49:27" %}} - happen um there is no battle between good and evil where you have Stakes that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2973" display="49:33" %}} - you're not sure who wins God won from the time that history first started there is no competition so to speak and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2980" display="49:40" %}} - that's because God is unique within the universe no one can compare to him no one has these attributes except for him  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2988" display="49:48" %}} - so um I think that's where we'll conclude this I mean obviously uh this bridge that we've spent talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2994" display="49:54" %}} - here going from these essential qualities of God to how they manifest in creation as omnipotence omniscience and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="2999" display="49:59" %}} - omnipresence but we're going to be talking about those things next but that's kind of how this section Works in taking us from the one to the other  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3006" display="50:06" %}} - talking about how these things make God unique by nature and no one can compare to him on that account so I think that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3013" display="50:13" %}} - where we're going to stop here and we will be picking up next talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3020" display="50:20" %}} - omnipotence all right so having just talked about how God is unique and he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3025" display="50:25" %}} - unique on account of his spirituality giving him complete dominion over material things in creation his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3032" display="50:32" %}} - externality to time his eternity giving him complete knowledge of things in creation and his immeasurability uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3040" display="50:40" %}} - giving him the ability to be present at all places in etern or in creation um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3045" display="50:45" %}} - those latter three things that's what we're going to be focusing on now starting with uh omnipotence this idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3052" display="50:52" %}} - that because God is outside of SpaceTime he can control everything within SpaceTime it's his right um his ability  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3059" display="50:59" %}} - to do this is because he can affect whatever changes he wants within the material realm nothing can transpire  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3067" display="51:07" %}} - except that which God happens or allows to happen based on the Free Will decisions of others therefore there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3074" display="51:14" %}} - no deed nor was there ever nor will there ever be which God is unable to do small or great within material creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3082" display="51:22" %}} - um and so I wanted to uh start off a bit of the discussion that we have here  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3087" display="51:27" %}} - talking about this question that you may have heard posed um something like so could God create a rock so big even he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3094" display="51:34" %}} - couldn't lift it um sometimes this comes up somewhat tongue and cheek sometimes people are actually serious in raising  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3100" display="51:40" %}} - this as an objection and so this is supposedly pitting two aspects of omnipotence against each other so on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3107" display="51:47" %}} - one side God's ability to create anything he wishes ex nilo that's Latin it means out of nothing so for for God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - ability to create um versus God's strength his ability to do things to manipulate material creation um and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3122" display="52:02" %}} - the people who make this argument they argue that the two superlatives mandated by omnipotence contradict each other so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3128" display="52:08" %}} - supposedly if God cannot create an object too heavy for him to lift he's not omnipotent because an omnipotent  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3134" display="52:14" %}} - creature would be able to create anything and likewise if there would exist some object that God could create  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3139" display="52:19" %}} - but he was unable to lift then he also would not be omnipotent because an omnipotent creature would be able to lift everything so people who make this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3146" display="52:26" %}} - argument they kind of say something like see either way he can't do something therefore he's not omnipotent now of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3151" display="52:31" %}} - course we don't agree with this argument as Christians and I'm about to explain why and this is one reason why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3156" display="52:36" %}} - apologetics um just as a side tangent is best engaged in with those who have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3161" display="52:41" %}} - gifts the requisite um gifting from God empowerment of the Holy Spirit and uh proper preparation to handle things like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3168" display="52:48" %}} - this appropriately because it's easy to get confused and tripped up and maybe not give as convincing an answer as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3174" display="52:54" %}} - ought as Christians when confronted with objections to the truth because this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3179" display="52:59" %}} - truth that we're talking about this is an objection to the idea of God's omnipotence that's kind of why I'm bringing it up just to highlight no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3186" display="53:06" %}} - really God is omnipotent what we mean by that okay so how do we handle this this supposed situation of contradiction that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3192" display="53:12" %}} - people bring up so we can let people who don't want to believe or we can kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3198" display="53:18" %}} - let them go on their way and this is kind of what I mean by we don't always have to take up this debate especially  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3203" display="53:23" %}} - if maybe it's not the right thing for you to do in a second but also and more to the point here it's not our job to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3210" display="53:30" %}} - convince people if people are going to not believe in God because of this there's almost nothing we can do their  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3217" display="53:37" %}} - hearts are already closed off to the truth and you'll see what I mean in a second here and so to answer this it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3222" display="53:42" %}} - obvious I'm GNA emphasize it again obvious that God can both create whatsoever he wishes and also manipulate  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3229" display="53:49" %}} - Creation in whatever way he wishes that's what we mean when we say that God's omnipotent so the idea of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3235" display="53:55" %}} - material object that he cannot create is definitionally impossible right it just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3241" display="54:01" %}} - it cannot happen and so to is a material object he cannot manipulate that he cannot change he cannot affect within  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3248" display="54:08" %}} - creation so lifting The Rock in this case so put differently there is no such thing as an object he could create but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3254" display="54:14" %}} - not lift or an object he could lift but not create that thing just doesn't exist the entire objection here is circular by  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3262" display="54:22" %}} - assuming that such a thing can exist to begin with and so when we say that that means that people who they raise this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3269" display="54:29" %}} - point they think they're they're so clever for this they've already put God in a box from the very beginning they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3275" display="54:35" %}} - already limiting what he can do just by the very way they phrase this and then they only proceed to smugly knock down  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3281" display="54:41" %}} - nothing but a straw man so they're not even addressing the real points in hand and again that's because anything that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3287" display="54:47" %}} - God could create he could lift by definition there is no such thing as an object where he can do one but not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3293" display="54:53" %}} - other and so I might say Okay step why are we why are we talking about this right I'm not that interested I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3298" display="54:58" %}} - raise that objection so the reason is because it kind of helps throw into relief what God can do right this is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3306" display="55:06" %}} - what we have in our heads we we don't have these logic puzzles when we say that God's omnipotent we know that God can do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3313" display="55:13" %}} - anything whatever anything might be um God can do it whatever it may be and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3318" display="55:18" %}} - with that we follow El Shai God Almighty the the leader of Angel hosts he who was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3324" display="55:24" %}} - an is and is to come the person who holds the very strings of the universe in his hands and can create or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3330" display="55:30" %}} - annihilate galaxies in the blink of an eye that's what we mean when we are talking about omnipotence not not this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3336" display="55:36" %}} - this hypothetical creature who might be able to create a rock right we're talking about the king of the universe the creator of everything that exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3344" display="55:44" %}} - and we' better fear that power and Majesty as we ought to uh to keep our own lives in perspective and so uh just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3351" display="55:51" %}} - to use a progression here to emphasize the point so as human beings we are tiny  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3357" display="55:57" %}} - compared to the vastness of just Earth much less our solar system much less our galaxy much less the universe itself but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3364" display="56:04" %}} - God is even bigger infinitely bigger in fact because he's not bound by it than the universe itself and God could snuff  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3371" display="56:11" %}} - out everything that exists in the blink of an eye if he decided to and so that is the kind of power in view when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3377" display="56:17" %}} - speak of God being omnipotent not that he actually will snop out the Universe on a whim but that it would be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3382" display="56:22" %}} - absolutely nothing for him to do so because he is in complete control of matter time and space and things only  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3389" display="56:29" %}} - exist because he causes them to exist it's not like they exist independent from his will and so to ties back um I I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3398" display="56:38" %}} - don't know if other people find this interesting or or satisfying on an intellectual level to knock down  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3403" display="56:43" %}} - arguments like this but when we say God's omnipotent God really can do anything within material creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3410" display="56:50" %}} - because he controls it and so this idea that uh he couldn't do something uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3416" display="56:56" %}} - whatever skepticism or doubt that people might Express on this is just misplaced  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3421" display="57:01" %}} - because God is not in any way Bound by material creation and so as in this example it simply means that people come  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3428" display="57:08" %}} - in already thinking of God as a limited creature um as something Bound by the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3433" display="57:13" %}} - rules in which we operate and that's just the wrong way to go about it because God is completely separate from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - the rules that govern all of creation so sorry I rambled a bit there but um this was something that I just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3445" display="57:25" %}} - thought it was worth us talking about as we examine this idea of omnipotence so a do you have anything you want to rip on  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3452" display="57:32" %}} - from what I've said or or other points you want to make on omnipotence itself uh yeah um let me say first of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3460" display="57:40" %}} - all that regarding the question you addressed the first time I heard in 2012 I'd never heard anything of that sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3467" display="57:47" %}} - and my fellow apologist then and I we used  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3473" display="57:53" %}} - to kind of people used to mistake us for each other on nirand then um I used to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3479" display="57:59" %}} - call him my twin because it seemed like we thought exactly the same his answer to that question was that's a word salad  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3487" display="58:07" %}} - it means exactly nothing like you can't explain you can't Define what you're talking about what's a rck that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3493" display="58:13" %}} - can't lift so something so um I know I know what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3499" display="58:19" %}} - behind it the idea is it's it's exactly like saying can God create a square circle because well God can do anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3506" display="58:26" %}} - can do everything so he must be able to do something completely nonsensical so um the answer that I find  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3517" display="58:37" %}} - in the scriptures for such things first of all is um there is nothing that God can't do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3524" display="58:44" %}} - and the first person to find out how wrong he was about what God can do and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3530" display="58:50" %}} - can't do was the wisest creature that God ever  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3536" display="58:56" %}} - made the one who should have been telling everybody just don't mess with him he knows he knows things you you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3543" display="59:03" %}} - don't even begin to imagine like he's already thought about what you you have not yet begun to imagine or conceive in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3549" display="59:09" %}} - your in your heart that's the person who first thought I can box God into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3555" display="59:15" %}} - corner I can I can put him in a catch 22 where he his his hands are tied he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3561" display="59:21" %}} - thought well I can't beat God in an actual fight I can't go to war with God and win he's too powerful but I could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3568" display="59:28" %}} - outsmart him that was Satan and uh how did that turn out for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3574" display="59:34" %}} - him well you see this is where things get a little uh annoying for people like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3579" display="59:39" %}} - me we we live in in Trivial times that means Jesus has come and died on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3585" display="59:45" %}} - cross the miracle has happened so it's it's it's easy to trivialize we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3590" display="59:50" %}} - see the the Marvel of this thing we don't see the enmity of this miracle  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3597" display="59:57" %}} - that God can forgive a sinner that God can forgive a sinner That's what Satan said was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3604" display="1:00:04" %}} - impossible that he could put in a position where if he forgave a sinner he would be acting  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3609" display="1:00:09" %}} - unjustly and if he punished The Sinner he would be acting he would be negating his character of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3616" display="1:00:16" %}} - love he thought he had won and then God did this Jesus thing and all of a sudden  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3622" display="1:00:22" %}} - Satan is looking like a complete idiot now those who say he could he create a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3627" display="1:00:27" %}} - rock that he can't live they sound real smart and after all they're speaking English most of us who speak English can  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3633" display="1:00:33" %}} - make sense of the words that they just used and it sounds like yeah yeah I mean could he could he I mean he right if he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3641" display="1:00:41" %}} - creates a rock then and he can't lift it well he can create a rock but now he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3649" display="1:00:49" %}} - can't lift it where is it's like oh why and your head is blown right like you've  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3654" display="1:00:54" %}} - said you've just made so much sense you've boxed God into a corner now he can't exist precisely what Satan thought  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3662" display="1:01:02" %}} - like I can put him in a situation where he will be forced to abandon creation and I get to rule over  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3669" display="1:01:09" %}} - it we really can't win there's something that God said that Paul said through the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3674" display="1:01:14" %}} - spirit in second Timothy Chapter 2 he said If you deny him he won't deny  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3680" display="1:01:20" %}} - himself so are there things God can do absolutely he won't lie he can't lie he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3686" display="1:01:26" %}} - can't deny himself there are all sorts of things God can do none of them is a reflection on his power all of them are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3694" display="1:01:34" %}} - reflection on his character there are lots of things God can do but if we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3700" display="1:01:40" %}} - talking about what his omnipotence actually means it doesn't mean he can he can create a rock that he can't lift his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3707" display="1:01:47" %}} - omnipotence means there is absolutely nothing that God could want to do that he want he can't do nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3715" display="1:01:55" %}} - like if God decided right now I want to create a sare circle he can create a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3720" display="1:02:00" %}} - square circle it doesn't make any kind of sense to us but I wouldn't bet against him so I don't even want to I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3726" display="1:02:06" %}} - don't even want to go there a roong that I can't lift yeah that's it's another nonsensical thing to imagine but I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3732" display="1:02:12" %}} - wouldn't bet against him if he decided that he wanted to do that that's the well but the whole point of why I framed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3739" display="1:02:19" %}} - this how I did was that the question itself is circular that there is no such  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3744" display="1:02:24" %}} - object right AB so so that's the whole thing in this is that now I will say you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3750" display="1:02:30" %}} - know scripture that comes to mind when we deal with this again is this idea of answering fools according to their Folly  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3755" display="1:02:35" %}} - I wouldn't even give people who make this argument the time of day most of the time they're not interested right no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3761" display="1:02:41" %}} - matter what you say they're not going to listen to you but the whole point of this is that the point that I was trying  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3767" display="1:02:47" %}} - to make when I brought this up was simply that we cannot in our thinking put God in a box and then speak of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3773" display="1:02:53" %}} - power in terms of the boxed version of God um we need to appreciate how big God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3779" display="1:02:59" %}} - is right yeah that's precisely right there is there is nothing wrong with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3785" display="1:03:05" %}} - answer that you gave it's actually where I'm starting from which is essentially this you don't know what God can or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3792" display="1:03:12" %}} - cannot do so shut it that's where you start then what is God's omnipotence the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3800" display="1:03:20" %}} - Bible is very clear there is nothing that God could possibly want to do that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3805" display="1:03:25" %}} - he can't do nothing can stop him in all of creation and this is what Satan keeps  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3810" display="1:03:30" %}} - learning time and time again and everybody that wants to oppose God I mean right now they're going bunkers  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3816" display="1:03:36" %}} - because of Technology because of science for the past 500 years we've been doing Miracles that they didn't think was  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3822" display="1:03:42" %}} - possible now we've gone to the Moon we have launched all sorts of machines into  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3828" display="1:03:48" %}} - space we exploring things that our great-grandfathers didn't even know existed all sorts of things are  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3833" display="1:03:53" %}} - happening in the the world today and people have lost their freaking minds they think now I'm God right because can God do all  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3843" display="1:04:03" %}} - this stuff I mean they're forgetting that all those things existed before they even learned how to you know put  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3849" display="1:04:09" %}} - anything together and send it to the Moon the Moon was already there how did it get there oh it was Evolution right  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3855" display="1:04:15" %}} - the nothing that exploded and became everything right so but for us who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3861" display="1:04:21" %}} - believe what we know from the scriptures is this there is nothing that God cannot do if  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3868" display="1:04:28" %}} - he wants to do it so if you create a logical impossibility I wouldn't bet on you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3876" display="1:04:36" %}} - winning against God assuming of course and what I'm assuming is that there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3881" display="1:04:41" %}} - any kind of sense in what you're saying now when Satan made his bet against the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3886" display="1:04:46" %}} - Lord and encouraged his fellow angels to to join him in that bed I'm absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3892" display="1:04:52" %}} - sure that while he was persuaded he he would win and those the third of the angels that agreed with him thought that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3897" display="1:04:57" %}} - they would win was that they were persuaded that this was an actual logical  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3902" display="1:05:02" %}} - impossibility if God is just and if God is loving well we can get away with sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3908" display="1:05:08" %}} - because you can't reconcile those two things well God did he did so again I  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3915" display="1:05:15" %}} - would say I have no idea the limits and this is the most important thing I have  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3920" display="1:05:20" %}} - no idea what the limits are to God's power I have no idea so if you create  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3926" display="1:05:26" %}} - something that sounds absolutely idiotic and you think this is where I've caught God I've put him in a box he can't win  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3932" display="1:05:32" %}} - in this one I'm not betting on you against the Lord I'm simply not now if you said well I I I bet you the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3939" display="1:05:39" %}} - cannot lie yeah he said so I won't fight you on that one he can't lie if you say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3946" display="1:05:46" %}} - that um God God cannot um deny himself sure I'm with you on that I'll bet I'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3954" display="1:05:54" %}} - bet on you any day of the week every day of the week everything I've got God cannot deny himself but you see if there  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3962" display="1:06:02" %}} - is anything the Bible does not say God can do and that we can't reason from the Bible that he can't do and you think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3968" display="1:06:08" %}} - it's some kind of logical impossibility yeah I'm not going with you on that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3974" display="1:06:14" %}} - I'm we have plenty of counter examples of that going real poorly like you said  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3979" display="1:06:19" %}} - now I will say that these arguments that I've been that you've been bringing up like can God can God lie can God deny  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3985" display="1:06:25" %}} - himself those are have a little bit different character um so the particular logical trap here this this whole Rock  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3992" display="1:06:32" %}} - business I brought up as an example of one of those arguments that we don't even have to wave our hand at like the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="3998" display="1:06:38" %}} - argument is literally it assumes things and it's circular in that regard that's the point I tried to make some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4004" display="1:06:44" %}} - other things um this idea of well if God can't sin turn into an all powerful  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4009" display="1:06:49" %}} - being sin therefore God can't exist sort of thing the problem with those is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4015" display="1:06:55" %}} - that their definition of what all powerful is like where are they getting it from right this is always why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4021" display="1:07:01" %}} - defining terms is important now I don't want to go down the Apologetics Rabbit Trail I didn't want to get a super  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4026" display="1:07:06" %}} - sidetracked again I was bringing this up sort of as as a point to examine this idea of boxing God and whenever we think  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4034" display="1:07:14" %}} - that God is limited in some way we better revise our thinking and I think we've talked about it well right we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4040" display="1:07:20" %}} - used good examples your example of Satan thinking that he he caught God in this in this way to uh that God couldn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4047" display="1:07:27" %}} - somehow reconcile Sinners to himself that was Satan's PR campaign if you will it's a great example of what not to do  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4055" display="1:07:35" %}} - right of trusting somehow that God can't do something uh whatever you're thinking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4061" display="1:07:41" %}} - you're probably wrong because God is in complete control he knows way better than we do about everything that happens  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4068" display="1:07:48" %}} - in the universe so um with that maybe we'll see if anyone has any questions  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4073" display="1:07:53" %}} - questions on this before we move on to the next one so this again is on the idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4080" display="1:08:00" %}} - omnipotence all right so that's probably where we'll we'll pivot from talking about God's omnipotence to his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4088" display="1:08:08" %}} - omniscience and so we spent all this time talking about well what can God do and now we're going to talk about what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4093" display="1:08:13" %}} - does God know that's going to be the next thing that we focus  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4099" display="1:08:19" %}} - on all right so as to omniscience uh here's the text coming straight out of the study uh we have the idea that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4106" display="1:08:26" %}} - is all knowing irrespective of time so again this is how this corresponds to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4112" display="1:08:32" %}} - God being Eternal and outside of time is that God knows everything irrespective of time he knows the end from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4119" display="1:08:39" %}} - beginning he can affect anything he desires in the temporal realm therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4124" display="1:08:44" %}} - God knows always has known and always will know everything the end from the beginning as the Everlasting one his  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4131" display="1:08:51" %}} - knowledge of every event that has or will or even could occur within his creation is comprehensive and absolute  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4139" display="1:08:59" %}} - so specific phrase that I wanted to pick out here is this this could occur business so it's not just knowing  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4146" display="1:09:06" %}} - everything that has and is and will occur but everything that could have occurred as well so I do not want to get  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4154" display="1:09:14" %}} - too off in the weeds of the the theological thing people give this a label the so-called molinism with a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4161" display="1:09:21" %}} - capital m m o l i n ISM um and this idea of middle knowledge um I that's just the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4169" display="1:09:29" %}} - theological jargon here um I actually don't particularly like bogging ourselves down in the theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4176" display="1:09:36" %}} - arguments that have happened over this um uh there's a a reasonably famous apologist in our day his name is William  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4182" display="1:09:42" %}} - Lane Craig um he is a prominent proponent of this particular Doctrine um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4188" display="1:09:48" %}} - I kind of like to talk about independent from that so the example that I thought we'd bring up to talk about this idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4195" display="1:09:55" %}} - God knowing uh things that didn't just happen or or that that like happened in  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4201" display="1:10:01" %}} - the past or will happen in the future but things uh kind of that this would have could have hypothetical sort of thing is uh when the Bible says that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4209" display="1:10:09" %}} - will never test us past what we can bear so that's 1 Corinthians 10:13 you know I could actually read full reference here  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4214" display="1:10:14" %}} - no temptation is overtaken you but such as is common to man and God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4220" display="1:10:20" %}} - beyond what you are able but with the Temptation will provide the way of Escape also so that you will be able to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4225" display="1:10:25" %}} - endure it now the Greek word here that is translated as Temptation in the nasb is also translated as testing um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4233" display="1:10:33" %}} - depending on context is how you know whether it's Temptation or testing um so this one can actually kind of go either  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4238" display="1:10:38" %}} - way that God will not test us past what we were able to bear um but the idea is well how does God know what we're able  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4245" display="1:10:45" %}} - to bear and the verse here implicitly requires that God knows where our limits  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4251" display="1:10:51" %}} - are how does God know that if it happens before we have actually done something and this is where you get into  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4258" display="1:10:58" %}} - this idea of this knowledge that God has is so complete that it even covers these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4264" display="1:11:04" %}} - situations past that which actually has or will occur hence middle knowledge  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4269" display="1:11:09" %}} - again I don't particularly like bogging ourselves down in uh some of the history so to speak here but it's necessary for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4277" display="1:11:17" %}} - God to know what what test we are and are not able to Bear he has to know  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4282" display="1:11:22" %}} - whether we would or would not pass a test were he to give it to us right um seems kind of like common sense um another example you can use is divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4289" display="1:11:29" %}} - discipline um how does God know what discipline is necessary for us right he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4294" display="1:11:34" %}} - has to know what discipline will best lead to Turning us back to him right to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4301" display="1:11:41" %}} - uh basically corresponding to the Free Will decisions we make in life well since we're all different we have these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4307" display="1:11:47" %}} - different um uh you know makeups talents aptitudes opinions everything thing uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4314" display="1:11:54" %}} - so the discipline with which now anyone who's had kids can probably relate to this uh the way in which you discipline  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4320" display="1:12:00" %}} - one child may need to be different than the way in which you discipline another so very encourageable little boys for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4325" display="1:12:05" %}} - example may need a much Sterner talking to than uh their more sensitive younger sisters for example um just not to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4332" display="1:12:12" %}} - generalize based on gender too much but uh you know sometimes people need a good bit more discipline uh because they're a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4339" display="1:12:19" %}} - little bit more resistant to it so God knows all of this perfectly he knows exactly what we need and what would and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4345" display="1:12:25" %}} - would not work with each of us specifically um all of this knowledge that we're getting at here this is God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4351" display="1:12:31" %}} - knowledge of that which could be of the hypothetical and uh I for whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4357" display="1:12:37" %}} - reason some of this is controversial theologically um so to me these examples  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4363" display="1:12:43" %}} - I've raised 1 Corinthians 10:13 God will not test us past what I can bear seems just kind of like it makes sense for God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4369" display="1:12:49" %}} - to have this knowledge it's necessary for him to uh act in this way way that everything is perfectly mapped out right  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4375" display="1:12:55" %}} - we believe in the for ordination of all events before the beginning of human history and so uh God's perfect for  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4382" display="1:13:02" %}} - ordination logically requires that he know everything about all potential paths in the mind-bogglingly complex  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4388" display="1:13:08" %}} - decision tree that spans the history of the entire universe so that's a really jargony way of saying that all of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4394" display="1:13:14" %}} - potentials that we're talking about for God's plan to be perfect he has to have already taken all of that into account  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4399" display="1:13:19" %}} - so it's kind of always puzzled me why people would ever think to argue against this um it's just this is just how big  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4406" display="1:13:26" %}} - God's knowledge is this is what it means when we say he's omnicient but alas some people do argue against this right and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4413" display="1:13:33" %}} - uh hypothesis Theory I don't know I cannot look into the hearts of people but perhaps it's because believing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4419" display="1:13:39" %}} - God knows even these things requires us to appreciate how truly big and unlike us uh who with our very finite  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4426" display="1:13:46" %}} - perspective that we have here within SpaceTime how unlike us God really is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4432" display="1:13:52" %}} - because for us this sort of knowledge is completely impossible for us to have we can't know what would or could happen  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4438" display="1:13:58" %}} - were this to you know were this event or that event to happen in our lives we can't predict that we have no idea but  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4444" display="1:14:04" %}} - God does because he's God because he's external to creation and so for now  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4449" display="1:14:09" %}} - again another thing that I'm raising here you should just mostly ignore the fact in my opinion that some people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4455" display="1:14:15" %}} - again tried to put God into a box in their minds right so we talked about this with omnipotence we're now we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4461" display="1:14:21" %}} - talking about it with omniscience uh people who say well God can't know that that's you know it doesn't make sense it's not logical etc etc um uh well you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4469" display="1:14:29" %}} - should kind of ignore the fact that some people do put God In A Box in their minds and content yourself with the sure  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4474" display="1:14:34" %}} - confidence that God knows everything when we say everything that is unbounded we mean everything absolutely everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4480" display="1:14:40" %}} - inclusive of our Free Will decisions before we even make them it's for knowledge and so and God is also so  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4487" display="1:14:47" %}} - infinitely wise as to have perfectly mapped out all of creature history before the universe was even created  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4492" display="1:14:52" %}} - God's plan perfectly captures everything from beginning to end there are no mistakes there is nothing that could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4499" display="1:14:59" %}} - happen that would be better than that which has already been foreordained and so this divine plan being worked out  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4505" display="1:15:05" %}} - around us God knows what he's doing he's not going to make mistakes and we need to have faith and trust in that so again  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4512" display="1:15:12" %}} - kind of introducing a way in which people box God in which they're not willing to accept that God knows everything and when we say everything we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4519" display="1:15:19" %}} - mean it everything um so a you want to bounce anything off of what I've said  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4525" display="1:15:25" %}} - here yeah I think I think uh the real sum of it um is is really God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4531" display="1:15:31" %}} - knowledge is perfect the Bible bears that out and um whenever we go into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4537" display="1:15:37" %}} - lot of the philosophy uh I know why molinism exists it's one of the answers  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4545" display="1:15:45" %}} - to trying to reconcile how God knows everything and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4551" display="1:15:51" %}} - yet we have free will it's one of those um theologies like you said we there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4557" display="1:15:57" %}} - quite a bit of getting into for that but I think I can say rather simply here  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4563" display="1:16:03" %}} - that first of all the Bible is absolutely clear that God's knowledge is perfect there is no um need to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4572" display="1:16:12" %}} - accommodate some imperfection in God's knowledge if he has imperfect knowledge he's not God we should remember again  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4579" display="1:16:19" %}} - that what God is by nature is that which  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4585" display="1:16:25" %}} - is and that is why the Bible tells us that his name is I will be what I am or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4592" display="1:16:32" %}} - I I I I am what I will be he's unaffected by time if his knowledge is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4599" display="1:16:39" %}} - affected by time then that definition becomes untrue if he has to learn things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4606" display="1:16:46" %}} - that definition becomes untrue if his knowledge depreciates loses value or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4612" display="1:16:52" %}} - quality over time that definition becomes untrue so he either has perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4619" display="1:16:59" %}} - knowledge or he is not God and this is actually how we can tell when something is not the true God it's one of the ways  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4625" display="1:17:05" %}} - we can tell that that thing does not have perfect knowledge that's why we can know for example that even a suser who  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4632" display="1:17:12" %}} - who can predict like it was happening with uh the slave girl who had the spirit of divination right we could  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4639" display="1:17:19" %}} - still say even with that demon rtion of power that is beyond human ability that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4646" display="1:17:26" %}} - was still not God we can tell that because like God said through one of the prophets bring  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4653" display="1:17:33" %}} - your divers find bring your Gods let's see who can predict the end from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4660" display="1:17:40" %}} - beginning like I can so God's knowledge is perfect that's not a question  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4665" display="1:17:45" %}} - molinism and questions of hypothesis what could be what would be and all of that stuff my answer to that is still  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4673" display="1:17:53" %}} - God knows everything and Jesus did demonstrate that matter of what could be when he talked about Sodom and Gomorrah  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4680" display="1:18:00" %}} - and yeah that is one of the proof text and this is why I didn't want to get into people argue about this very long  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4686" display="1:18:06" %}} - and audite but the idea that we're introducing here like Audi said is just that when we say God's knowledge is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4693" display="1:18:13" %}} - perfect we we mean it every every down to the last drgs of the logical  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4698" display="1:18:18" %}} - implication of that so to speak and yeah and here's need we just need to speak as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4704" display="1:18:24" %}} - if we actually believe that because people people in their heads again they try to put God in a box they try to say  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4710" display="1:18:30" %}} - well but but but and the answer is no like Audi said God's knowledge is perfect and complete from the beginning  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4718" display="1:18:38" %}} - to the end so I would say this a lot of times in in matters of discussing the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4724" display="1:18:44" %}} - Bible people don't discuss the Bible they want to talk philosophy and here's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4731" display="1:18:51" %}} - the thing we have to be look philosophy is good if it is good philosophy as a  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4739" display="1:18:59" %}} - matter of fact what we consider good philosophy is the Bible so if the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4744" display="1:19:04" %}} - says it it's true the Bible doesn't say it's suspect at at best it's suspect  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4750" display="1:19:10" %}} - best so if someone shows up and starts going into the ins and outs about why  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4755" display="1:19:15" %}} - this or that is logical I'm listening for yeah the Bible actually does say or doesn't say if I don't hear that I don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4761" display="1:19:21" %}} - really care what you're saying so if you're insisting that if he knew then this if he didn't know then that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4769" display="1:19:29" %}} - what I I I really don't care the question I want to hear or what I want to hear from you is the Bible says this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4776" display="1:19:36" %}} - or doesn't say that that's all so as far as I'm concerned the Bible is clear  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4782" display="1:19:42" %}} - about God's perfect knowledge and and complete knowledge there is no question  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4788" display="1:19:48" %}} - about whether God knows everything or doesn't know Peter himself said it to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4793" display="1:19:53" %}} - Jesus Christ you know all things you know that I love you so when God is asking us questions he's not seeking  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4799" display="1:19:59" %}} - information that's very obvious so um having said that all questions that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4806" display="1:20:06" %}} - arise from if God knows we have to understand the answer  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4812" display="1:20:12" %}} - is not in he probably doesn't that's not where the answer to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4817" display="1:20:17" %}} - that question is if the question is how do I reconcile the fact that God has perfect knowledge to this is then  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4823" display="1:20:23" %}} - there's a third piece that you're missing you need to find that you cannot  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4829" display="1:20:29" %}} - solve that problem by reducing what God knows because then you would make him less than God that's the end that I can  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4836" display="1:20:36" %}} - you know yeah no I mean and like I said not going to go down the full Rabbit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4842" display="1:20:42" %}} - Trail there um you you brought up the Sodom and gomorah passage there's other arguments I mean I made mine using the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4848" display="1:20:48" %}} - testing passage here from 1 Corinthians chapter 10 uh more of the point is is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4854" display="1:20:54" %}} - that the people who want to limit God to say that God can't know these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4860" display="1:21:00" %}} - somehow that it's logically impossible where are they getting that from right it's it's the same issue with the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4866" display="1:21:06" %}} - whole thing that we talked about about the limits people place upon God's omnipotence is that the limits that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4871" display="1:21:11" %}} - people who argue against I'm not even So Pro all the arguments that people use for this particular teaching in so far  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4877" display="1:21:17" %}} - as it just means that when we say God knows everything we really do mean everything um everything that has and is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4884" display="1:21:24" %}} - and will or could or could have or everything in between right because he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4889" display="1:21:29" %}} - God um and we just have to respect that that's all and so that is omniscience um  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4895" display="1:21:35" %}} - God knows the end from the beginning God is in uh complete control of everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4900" display="1:21:40" %}} - that that has and is and will happen in the universe because God's plan is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4905" display="1:21:45" %}} - perfect it spans time from beginning to end because God knows all um that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4911" display="1:21:51" %}} - omniscience I think that's where we'll cut for omniscience and next we're going to talk about  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4920" display="1:22:00" %}} - omnipresence all right so now that we finished our discussion here of omniscience uh talking about how just  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4927" display="1:22:07" %}} - like with omnipotent some people kind of put God In A Box in their minds they  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4932" display="1:22:12" %}} - right from the outset don't view him kind of as this being separate from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4937" display="1:22:17" %}} - SpaceTime but they try to contextualize him in terms of the way we might understand very powerful creatures that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4945" display="1:22:25" %}} - are still part of our universe well in the same way people might not always appreciate that God is absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4952" display="1:22:32" %}} - everywhere within creation so God is ever present irrespective of space he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4957" display="1:22:37" %}} - can affect anything he desires in the spatial realm therefore God has the ability has always had and always will  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4964" display="1:22:44" %}} - have to be anywhere and everywhere local and Universal and this is within creation within the universe uh now this  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4971" display="1:22:51" %}} - note is me this isn't directly from the study this is something I wrote I just say a particular note is that this means  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4976" display="1:22:56" %}} - that God sees all he sees everything that happens within creation nobody can sneak anything past God and on that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4983" display="1:23:03" %}} - great day of days on Judgment Day be Before the Throne all will be revealed  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4989" display="1:23:09" %}} - um this also means uh as a practical note that it's completely futile to try to run away from God so like Jonah from  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="4996" display="1:23:16" %}} - the Book of Jonah we will find that no matter where we go God and His purposes for us will always be there too  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5003" display="1:23:23" %}} - so because God is ever presentent in the world uh no matter where we might try to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5009" display="1:23:29" %}} - escape uh to run to hide from the things that God has for us we will never be  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5014" display="1:23:34" %}} - able to because God is at all places at all times because he's God so aie do you  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5020" display="1:23:40" %}} - have any points you want to make um I think maybe this is among the more straightforward of the characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5025" display="1:23:45" %}} - of God that we've gone over here um but interested to hear if you have things to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5031" display="1:23:51" %}} - say um I don't think there is a much more to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5038" display="1:23:58" %}} - say there it's just that God is not limited by space he created it he exists  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5046" display="1:24:06" %}} - without it or he existed without it until he made it and he absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5051" display="1:24:11" %}} - controls it so he can do whatever he wants with it and he's not limited by it  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5058" display="1:24:18" %}} - I think that's um uh I wouldn't say a more correct way to  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5064" display="1:24:24" %}} - put it but a more um uh all embracing way to put it uh in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5072" display="1:24:32" %}} - sense that God is not limited by space so one might be thinking in terms of if  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5079" display="1:24:39" %}} - he's everywhere is he in Hell uh but then we talk about the Lake of Fire  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5084" display="1:24:44" %}} - being um uh God casting people away from his presence so what does that mean what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5092" display="1:24:52" %}} - we mean the Bible never uses the word omnipresent but it does say things like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5098" display="1:24:58" %}} - where can I go away from you if I if I make my bed in hell there you are as  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5104" display="1:25:04" %}} - well but of course hell in that sense is show the place of the Dead um regardless  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5111" display="1:25:11" %}} - the point is there is no place in the universe in all of creation that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5118" display="1:25:18" %}} - outside of God's reach MH so that's what I would say I I think bringing up the  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5123" display="1:25:23" %}} - point of so-called biblical geography um you know ichus has a chart I don't remember exactly which study but of like  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5130" display="1:25:30" %}} - the third heaven separated by the universe from like the waters above and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5136" display="1:25:36" %}} - then we have the universe and then um hell and the Lake of Fire you know uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5142" display="1:25:42" %}} - Jesus went into sha like you said the grave um when he descended uh before he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5148" display="1:25:48" %}} - ascended on the third day and that's different than the Lake of Fire where the devil and fallen angels and  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5153" display="1:25:53" %}} - unbelievers will go at the end of time um so-called again biblical geography  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5159" display="1:25:59" %}} - here um but regardless like you said the point is God's not limited by space or  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5165" display="1:26:05" %}} - spatial concerns and so uh for us practically as human beings well we don't have to worry about any of that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5171" display="1:26:11" %}} - stuff that happens after we die at the moment in how we we in how we live our lives um it is just true that God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5177" display="1:26:17" %}} - always before us um and we should actually view this more as a comfort than as a a bad thing is is someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5183" display="1:26:23" %}} - snooping on us because this means that nothing can separate us from God we have this verse I I know Paul wrote maybe  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5191" display="1:26:31" %}} - it's Philippians I don't remember like nothing can separate us from the love of God As far as the East is from the West  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5196" display="1:26:36" %}} - that sort of thing uh God is always with us and that should be a supreme Comfort  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5202" display="1:26:42" %}} - to us uh probably more than anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5207" display="1:26:47" %}} - else all right so just to run through the things that we've talked about here in this lesson examining the nature of  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5215" display="1:26:55" %}} - God so we have talked first about God's essential characteristics how he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5220" display="1:27:00" %}} - spiritual Eternal and immeasurable in a spatial sense um and then how that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5226" display="1:27:06" %}} - manifests within creation is him being omnipotent omniscience and omnipresent um and we spent a good bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5233" display="1:27:13" %}} - of our time in the study talking about how God is unique and because no other  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5238" display="1:27:18" %}} - being in all of creation um uh you know or outside of creation right because we  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5244" display="1:27:24" %}} - believe there's one God and that God made SpaceTime uh no one is like God no  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5250" display="1:27:30" %}} - one in the universe can reasonably be compared to him he's absolutely unique and therefore the person to whom all  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5256" display="1:27:36" %}} - honor is due um and so he transcends the physical Universe um through these  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5261" display="1:27:41" %}} - characteristics and within the physical Universe he is supreme within it because  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5267" display="1:27:47" %}} - he is omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent and so this is how we view God  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5272" display="1:27:52" %}} - with respect to his infinite nature and if you remember at the beginning of this lesson we had been emphasizing that  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5279" display="1:27:59" %}} - God's infinite nature illuminates his abilities what things God can do how he  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5284" display="1:28:04" %}} - interacts with creation and in the next lesson we are going to pick up talking about God's perfect character and what  
{{% timestamp videoId="2EMBqNotHqs" time="5290" display="1:28:10" %}} - that says about his motives
