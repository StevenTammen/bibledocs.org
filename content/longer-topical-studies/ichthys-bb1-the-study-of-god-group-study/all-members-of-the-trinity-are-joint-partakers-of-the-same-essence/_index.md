## Summary {#summary}

This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is composed of three (or more) different "gods".

### Key point: God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is composed of three (or more) different "gods" {#key-point-god-is-three-in-person-but-that-does-not-mean-that-the-trinity-is-composed-of-three-or-more-different-gods}

God is *one* in essence, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are the sole, joint partakers of that same essence rather than three similar beings of similar essence. All so-called Christian sects which elevate saints and angels to the status of divinity essentially belong to this heretical category (after the manner of pagan pantheons, which also possess numerous "deities" of lesser and greater rank). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity alone share the same unique essence:

Some things I'll add here in addition to this one verse Dr. Luginbill quoted, to emphasize even more that the Holy Spirit is One with the Father and the Son, being God:

- 2 Peter 1:21
- Acts 5:3-4
- Matthew 28:19 -- "name" here is singular, not plural. And it is also not repeated for the Son and the Spirit; i.e., there is one name and it equally applies to all three.

{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - all right guys so this week we are going to be going over uh this topic here about how all members of the Trinity are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="9" display="00:09" %}} - joint partakers of the same Essence so all three members of the Trinity share the same Essence the same being and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="17" display="00:17" %}} - makes them United in a way that means basically that they aren't three separate Gods they're not three separate  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="24" display="00:24" %}} - beings and so these are the points we're going to be going through here in the summary um just as a reminder we been  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="30" display="00:30" %}} - going through uh some points basically establishing things that the Trinity is not and that is throwing into sharper  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="38" display="00:38" %}} - relief what the Trinity actually is so we've kind of been uh knocking down some of these heresies that have cropped up  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="44" display="00:44" %}} - in the past examining uh all this scripture that supports the points that we've been making uh to kind of throw  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="51" display="00:51" %}} - into sharper relief what the Trinity actually is and so this particular point we are noting that God is three in  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="59" display="00:59" %}} - person um we've established that that was a a past week we did uh that the three members of the Trinity are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="65" display="01:05" %}} - actually um separate personal or the three three separate persons um but that does not mean that the Trinity is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="71" display="01:11" %}} - actually composed of three or more different gods three separate beings and so that's because they share the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="78" display="01:18" %}} - Essence and that's what we're going over this week so we're going to be looking at how the father is revealed to be God  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="83" display="01:23" %}} - the Son and the father are revealed to be uniquely God and then all three are revealed to be uniquely God um and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="90" display="01:30" %}} - this will overlap a good bit with the lesson in the study that we did where we established that all three members of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="98" display="01:38" %}} - the Trinity are God because well all three are God and God is one so it's kind of the same thing but nonetheless  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="106" display="01:46" %}} - we're going to hit this to establish the point that just because God is three in person does not mean that we have three  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="113" display="01:53" %}} - separate Gods so this is the overview point that we're going to be making here that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="122" display="02:02" %}} - is three in person but that does not mean that the Trinity is composed of three or more different gods and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="130" display="02:10" %}} - again as we've gone over the traditional definition of the Trinity is that God is three in person but one in essence or  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="136" display="02:16" %}} - one in essence but three in person and so that means that all three members of the Trinity so the father and the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="143" display="02:23" %}} - and the spirit are the sole joint partakers of the same Essence and that's a big  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="150" display="02:30" %}} - uh technical perhaps but what that means is that they are all they all share the same being the same Essence rather than  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="157" display="02:37" %}} - being three similar beings of similar Essence and uh we talked a little bit in our last lesson about how these  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="165" display="02:45" %}} - attributes these characteristics that are part of God's nature so God's infinite nature and God's perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="172" display="02:52" %}} - character uh those are things coming from uh the the essence of God that we went over  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="180" display="03:00" %}} - in the earliest lessons in this study of theology proper and we've argued that um all three members of the Trinity have  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="187" display="03:07" %}} - equal share in those uh last time we were talking about how there's not any inferiority or disparity in status um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="193" display="03:13" %}} - activity or function um uh because all three members of the Trinity share this Essence and those are characteristics um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="202" display="03:22" %}} - of the essence of God and because all three members of the Trinity share that Essence all three members of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="208" display="03:28" %}} - are characterized by these things um and so that's what we mean by them having the same Essence rather than having  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="214" display="03:34" %}} - three similar beings of similar Essence um and so among other things uh some of these attributes like infinity and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="222" display="03:42" %}} - omniscience and things like this um something that makes our conception of God very unique among world religions is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="230" display="03:50" %}} - that there really only can be one God um from a logical sense the uncaused cause if you will how can you have more than  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="238" display="03:58" %}} - one uncaused cause um so we don't want to get super philosophical about it but this idea that uh God is this unique  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="247" display="04:07" %}} - being um you know we emphasized his sovereignty and his uniqueness um in our past studies of his Essence all of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="253" display="04:13" %}} - is rolled up into the idea that God there can only be one um being of this of this sort however there's three  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="261" display="04:21" %}} - persons but they all share the same Essence and so maybe it just sounds like we're asserting things here we'll get to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="267" display="04:27" %}} - some scripture in some of the slides here but um throughout history uh many sects or  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="274" display="04:34" %}} - uh groups of people you know maybe who even profess Christianity have elevated other things so either human beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="282" display="04:42" %}} - Saints or angels to somehow maybe they don't even call it Divinity like they would not put them on equal footing with  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="289" display="04:49" %}} - God but they they put them on higher footing than normal human beings and this is not okay it's not good because  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="297" display="04:57" %}} - we know that only God is good that human beings You know despite uh May the fact that maybe some human beings make good  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="305" display="05:05" %}} - choices and are exceptional Believers they're still just human beings right um and so uh we want to flee far away from  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="314" display="05:14" %}} - anything that smacks of pantheons of maybe demigods or elevating Angels worshiping Angels worshiping other human  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="323" display="05:23" %}} - beings I mean how about worshiping Mary uh you know like as certain Cults have done throughout history  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="330" display="05:30" %}} - uh none of that is okay because there's only one God and he's the only one whom we should worship um so in saying this  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="339" display="05:39" %}} - where we are going with this particular point this week is that even though the Bible teaches that the Trinity has three  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="346" display="05:46" %}} - persons we are not saying that there are three gods that there's multiple gods and there's no room for there to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="353" display="05:53" %}} - anyone other than the three members of the Trinity um kind of as part of this as part of the being who we worship so  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="363" display="06:03" %}} - that's my bit of a rambly introduction here a do you have any other initial points you want to make on what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="368" display="06:08" %}} - talking about this week okay just to jump off of what you're saying and U I think it is it is worth um getting a  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="379" display="06:19" %}} - tad bit philosophical about this because the Bible is very very emphatic about the fact that God is one um when it says  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="389" display="06:29" %}} - that it seems like an assertion and this is of course for us as Believers we take what the Bible says as true so if it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="398" display="06:38" %}} - Asser things that's fine but other people would say well how do we know that there is one God and this is where  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="408" display="06:48" %}} - the philosophical reasoning might come into play and the sense the the reason that that might matter is this God is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="416" display="06:56" %}} - very unique um entity very unique the very state of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="424" display="07:04" %}} - universe right now the state of creation right now is because someone decided that one person  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="432" display="07:12" %}} - or there couldn't be just one God that he too could be God that is why there can't be one God because there can't be  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="439" display="07:19" %}} - more than one God if there is more than one God what results from that is a clash of wills and when you have two  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="448" display="07:28" %}} - entities that are Omni poent omnipresent Omni everything they have all the qualities of God but they have  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="458" display="07:38" %}} - differing Wills differing desires differing if you will visions of what existence should be what's going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="468" display="07:48" %}} - result from that is chaos catastrophe it would be an eternal state of chaos and catastrophe  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="477" display="07:57" %}} - that's what would happen as it is we have just one creature who happens to be the most powerful creature that God  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="485" display="08:05" %}} - created and we are in the mess that we are in what if it was actually just another  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="491" display="08:11" %}} - entity that was actually God that's that's why it makes sense that no matter what we we might think or let's put it  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="500" display="08:20" %}} - this way no matter what other people might think about the fact that there is a trinity and therefore this must mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="506" display="08:26" %}} - that there are three Gods we know that these three persons must be fundamentally United it makes sense for  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="516" display="08:36" %}} - the Bible to assert that they're fundamentally United in essence so that they can't actually be  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="523" display="08:43" %}} - opposed in any way to each other that's the the uniqueness and the Oneness of their godhood there are three persons in  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="532" display="08:52" %}} - the sense that you can see their individuality the fact that the son is not the the father for example and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="539" display="08:59" %}} - the spirit is not the sun you can see these things demonstrated in the Bible but there is no um no difference  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="549" display="09:09" %}} - whatsoever in their if you will aspirations not they don't have aspirations or desires or will or what  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="555" display="09:15" %}} - whatever they might be wanting to accomplish they perfectly United in these things that's that's where the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="562" display="09:22" %}} - their Oneness in essence has to be understood now I will say that through throughout history many of the heresies  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="571" display="09:31" %}} - relating to this and even in other religions that have pantheons there is not equality among the people in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="578" display="09:38" %}} - pantheon so um to use a classic example just take Greek mythology in the Greek pantheon Zeus was seen as being the head  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="587" display="09:47" %}} - of the pantheon right and you might have other people like Poseidon or Hades and Hera and Aphrodite and Athena and so on  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="595" display="09:55" %}} - um the the gods and goddesses that were part of this but they did to have um what we would call equal Authority equal  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="603" display="10:03" %}} - nature um and specific to us I pulled up this chart here was from the earlier lesson in our study talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="610" display="10:10" %}} - essence of God where even if someone wanted to assert um that the members of the Trinity were actually separate  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="619" display="10:19" %}} - beings so they didn't share an Essence they would have to be asserting because we've established already from points  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="625" display="10:25" %}} - we've already gone through in this series that the members of the Trinity exhibit these characteristics right um I  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="632" display="10:32" %}} - mean we could go look at the specific verses you know where we went for each one but if the members of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="638" display="10:38" %}} - exhibit these characteristics and this is what Dr luganville meant when he said three beings of similar Essence um right  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="646" display="10:46" %}} - so they share the same Essence that's the correct teaching but the only other teaching that even has the patina of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="653" display="10:53" %}} - possibility to it is if all three beings shared fundamentally similar Essence um so even if they were separate they would  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="663" display="11:03" %}} - still share many of these same attributes now ai's kind of gotten to the heart of the problem with this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="668" display="11:08" %}} - that um even even among uh separate beings who have um you know separate Wills if you will there there will  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="677" display="11:17" %}} - always be tension there will always be disagreement and conflict um and the uniqueness of God is that we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="685" display="11:25" %}} - separate persons who share the same being the same will not that they aren't separate persons but that there is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="693" display="11:33" %}} - Unity that completely exceeds and transcends human understanding in a way that isn't possible if they weren't  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="700" display="11:40" %}} - United in one Essence um so uh just trying to point out here that even when we talk about uh heresies in this regard  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="710" display="11:50" %}} - uh you can basically just categorically ignore anything that doesn't at least start with the assumption that they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="716" display="11:56" %}} - three beings of fundamentally similar essence you know in the manner we've talked about here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="723" display="12:03" %}} - because you know that you have to start there um and but some of what we're going to be talking about this week is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="730" display="12:10" %}} - basically just how the Bible in how it talks about these things simply asserts that the three members of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="737" display="12:17" %}} - are God um not that this one's a God and that one's a God and that one's a God but they are all God um and for that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="744" display="12:24" %}} - reason that's why we are saying that they share the same Essence they are the same being  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="749" display="12:29" %}} - because they are all God while at the same time being distinct persons yeah I would even um sort of mention that in  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="758" display="12:38" %}} - the pantheon that you talked about like the Greek for example there was constant conflict so there's right right right  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="767" display="12:47" %}} - right well I mean you know and and certainly I mean I I took a couple mythology classes it was related to my  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="773" display="12:53" %}} - major um in college because I was a Classics major and so this isn't just a unique facet of Greek mythology in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="780" display="13:00" %}} - Norse pantheon as well for example where you have Odin and Loki and Thor and and Freya and so on like you said conflict  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="790" display="13:10" %}} - and but there was also disparity and Status there there there was not this sense of equality um and also and both  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="796" display="13:16" %}} - of these pantheons not to get too off topic here but um both of those pantheons they kind of the gods were  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="803" display="13:23" %}} - portrayed as very human in a way that God for us as Christians is not and this isn't to say you know like how when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="810" display="13:30" %}} - talk about how um the the wine press of God's Wrath we call that an anthropopathism um you know we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - attributing this human emotion to God in a way that God really doesn't have that in the same sense that we do whereas for  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="825" display="13:45" %}} - the Greeks and the Norse and and you know plenty of other pantheons throughout cultures and history the gods  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="831" display="13:51" %}} - were basically just really powerful humans so they magnified um they magnified human Humanity in all of its  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="839" display="13:59" %}} - good and bad parts and so for example in The Iliad which is a famous uh War epic written by the Greek poet Homer call it  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="848" display="14:08" %}} - Circa 800 BC um you know uh aliot is all about uh you know glory on the battlefield uh this is the siege of Troy  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="856" display="14:16" %}} - by the Greeks and um Zeus comes off looking kind of like a big meanie um you know he's he's kind of sitting back and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="863" display="14:23" %}} - watching the Greeks and the Trojans destroy each other um and you know there isn't this sense of fundamental justice  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="871" display="14:31" %}} - but basically Zeus gets angry um Zeus is capricious in the way that humans are they don't transcend you know the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="879" display="14:39" %}} - flaws of humanity but okay so all that you know I guess I don't want to get to off topic but our God is not like that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="887" display="14:47" %}} - right our god is perfect and just and infinite so that he is Nothing Like Us right in our fallen sinful State um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="899" display="14:59" %}} - more to the point among the people in the godhead among the Father the Son and the spirit they share this this Unity of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="906" display="15:06" %}} - perfect will of perfection in a way that we can't even comprehend um so it's not even like you know siblings or friends  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="915" display="15:15" %}} - who know each other really well who tend to you know agree more than they disagree it is perfect unity and that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="921" display="15:21" %}} - fundamentally different than relationships that we can understand as humans because we don't have those in  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="926" display="15:26" %}} - our own lives there is no equivalent to this and this is another way in which God is completely  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="935" display="15:35" %}} - unique right so the first place that we are going to turn here um in establishing  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="945" display="15:45" %}} - this again we are talking about how God being three in person does not mean that we have three different gods well we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="951" display="15:51" %}} - g to again be focusing on this sense that the father is God and the son is God and the spirit is God so they're all  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="958" display="15:58" %}} - gods which means that they share the same Essence they're all the same being and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="963" display="16:03" %}} - so this is uh one of the the classic verses in the Old Testament that talks about um God being one um and so uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="972" display="16:12" %}} - something that Audi had actually brought up off the recording you know in between time here I just thought it Bears  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="977" display="16:17" %}} - mentioning here is how unique this is among world religions um so for uh the unity that we have um you know this mono  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="988" display="16:28" %}} - theism is what you know the sociologists and historians will call it um is such a a different Force than all of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="996" display="16:36" %}} - religions around them and so it always put Israel in conflict with the Canaanites or the Hittites for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1003" display="16:43" %}} - because you know the Israelites were at least they're supposed to be monotheistic versus these other cultures  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1008" display="16:48" %}} - which were not it is a fundamental incompatibility right and in that um in this verse in Deuteronomy chapter 4 so  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1018" display="16:58" %}} - uh we are given to know that he is God and there is no other beside him um you know I think there's other places in  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1024" display="17:04" %}} - Deuteronomy um in uh you know the pentti the earliest books of the Bible that make it real clear that um you know as  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1031" display="17:11" %}} - God had revealed himself to the Hebrew people there was one God and only one God and that made him very distinct from  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1039" display="17:19" %}} - you know all of the other people groups around them um in Canaan even in Egypt um so you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1049" display="17:29" %}} - with other things that we've talked about before the father is usually pretty easy here right when we say the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - father is god father being the the representation of deity as AI has put it before well yeah you like we don't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1062" display="17:42" %}} - to try too hard to show that one um so this is one example as in other places we could aduce verse after verse after  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1071" display="17:51" %}} - verse that would support this point as well um in fact we already have more or less and this none of this should seem  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1076" display="17:56" %}} - like completely new to us because we've already gone through and established that the father is God and that the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1081" display="18:01" %}} - is God and the spirit is God but the point that we're kind of emphasizing now is that because they are all God they  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1087" display="18:07" %}} - are united in essence it means that they're not three separate persons that's what we're getting at now  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1094" display="18:14" %}} - but anything more to say on the father specifically oh no I don't think so yeah I mean like I say this one probably the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1104" display="18:24" %}} - easiest of the members of the Trinity to get behind how the father is god um because the father is the one who acts  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1111" display="18:31" %}} - as the representation of deity the one um who is separate from the world now uh stands behind that Veil um the one who  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1120" display="18:40" %}} - kind of manifests the authority of the godhead so well we'll leave this here and uh we will pick up talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1128" display="18:48" %}} - Son and the spirit also being God meaning that they are also uh joint partakers of the same Essence rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1136" display="18:56" %}} - than being separate beings so next we're going to be talking about the father and the son and in fact this  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1145" display="19:05" %}} - verse right here this is John chapter 10 verse3 where Jesus says I and the father are one um you know to the point that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1154" display="19:14" %}} - people sometimes say that Jesus never claims to be God you know I don't I don't know exactly what they make of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1160" display="19:20" %}} - this verse then but um this is very literally the point that we are talking about right now where Jesus doesn't say  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1169" display="19:29" %}} - I am a being of deity on equal status with the father you know so if that were the case you know if we were speaking of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1180" display="19:40" %}} - three separate beings who had similar Essence right the the not uh God is made up of three persons who are joint  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1188" display="19:48" %}} - partakers of the same Essence but if we were actually talking about three separate Gods so to speak this verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1193" display="19:53" %}} - makes absolutely no sense because Jesus would have to instead claim that he was a being on par with the father you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1202" display="20:02" %}} - that he and the father had equal abilities uh equal character you know that they were similar but that they  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1209" display="20:09" %}} - were not the same but Jesus doesn't claim that Jesus says that he and the father are one he is God and in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1217" display="20:17" %}} - getting this point wrong it it you know like you can't you can't responsibly interpret when Jesus claims this when he  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1223" display="20:23" %}} - claims to be God um in the Gospel of John and people want to Stone him it it no sense unless his audience understood  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1231" display="20:31" %}} - what he was claiming right because the very fact that they got so enraged about this was because Jesus wasn't claiming  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1239" display="20:39" %}} - to be you know like someone God sent or you know another being he was claiming to be God to be in Union with God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1247" display="20:47" %}} - that's what affronted the Jews so much was that they understood exactly what he was claiming but he was claiming to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1255" display="20:55" %}} - one with God you know like that's what got them so so angry um and that's what this verse says so yeah yeah in fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1264" display="21:04" %}} - he he they he actually he actually appealed to Psalm 82 where it says um you are Gods so because of of you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1276" display="21:16" %}} - how the sorts of gymnastics that people have pulled on that passage I'm trying to say yeah he really meant this no he  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - really meant that he didn't really mean this and that and so on but he actually said to explain what he said that if  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1294" display="21:34" %}} - those to whom the word of God came where Gods how much more the person that God himself Sanctified and sent into the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1303" display="21:43" %}} - world that is to say he's saying I and the father are one is actually more than just being told you are Gods he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1312" display="21:52" %}} - saying what the father is I am too yeah that's that's pretty tic so his deity is declared  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1323" display="22:03" %}} - without we we were looking at um let see this particular verse was uh you know verse 30 I and the father are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1332" display="22:12" %}} - one so they wanted to Stone him she says I love this she just asked him for which good work are you stoning me you know um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1341" display="22:21" %}} - and they say and this is what I mean about them understanding what it was he was claiming they say we're not stoning  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1346" display="22:26" %}} - you for any good work but because because uh you're blaspheming you a mere man claim to be God that that sentence  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1354" display="22:34" %}} - there doesn't make sense unless they understood what he was claiming and they understood that he was claiming that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1359" display="22:39" %}} - himself was God right it's not that he was a God that he was a creature sent by God but that he was God um and that yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1368" display="22:48" %}} - you know it's exactly what we're establishing here right I mean and then here's what AI said Jesus reasoning with  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1373" display="22:53" %}} - them about the quote from Psalm 82 um so why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I Saidi not God's son do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1381" display="23:01" %}} - believe me unless I do the works of my father but if I do them even though you do not believe me believe the works that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1386" display="23:06" %}} - you may know and understand that the father is in me and I in the father right now I should say just by point of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1394" display="23:14" %}} - reference that when we talk about being indwell by the Holy Spirit and we say the spirit's within us that that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1400" display="23:20" %}} - different than what this means you know in yeah to use the philosophical jargon in an ontological sense this is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1407" display="23:27" %}} - different claim than that claim right yeah yeah and so maybe a bit pedantic but the point is is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1414" display="23:34" %}} - that Jesus very explicitly In this passage in John chapter 10 is claiming that he is not like a being on par with  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1422" display="23:42" %}} - God that God sent or whatever that he is God he and the father are one they have complete Unity which ontologically  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1430" display="23:50" %}} - Speaking means that they share the same Essence they are the same being it's what it has to mean because if Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1435" display="23:55" %}} - refers to the father as a separate person yet says he is one with him that's where  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1441" display="24:01" %}} - we get different persons but same Essence from um yeah yeah all right what is what is the word for where he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1450" display="24:10" %}} - saying that uh you are Gods you're all gods is that l so in the Hebrew it would be Elohim  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1459" display="24:19" %}} - plural probably in the Greek I'm assuming it's the plural here if you're talking because this quote in John 10 is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1465" display="24:25" %}} - a quote um even if a not a word for word quote from the suant I'm guessing that this word  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1471" display="24:31" %}} - here now I me here I can look it up so what is this this is verse John 10:34 I bet it's the plural of Theos  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1481" display="24:41" %}} - um that would have to do with um the nature right our ability to choose the image of God Genesis  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1492" display="24:52" %}} - 1:27 talks about that um we are Godlike in our choice at least that's certainly how ikus takes it um well the English  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1500" display="25:00" %}} - uses it as a little G that's what I say the little G Gods the little little G Gods indeed  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1507" display="25:07" %}} - um there there's also it is the plural of Theos so yeah there's also um the bit that yes we have the power to choose and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1521" display="25:21" %}} - to respond to God's Authority but we all the people specifically to whom this was said in p  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1528" display="25:28" %}} - 82 and um to whom Jesus was referring um in John 10 were God's deputies you know the rulers in the world those you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1539" display="25:39" %}} - like when the Bible said in is to God sits in his Council you know and um he is saying to them uh basically be be  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1551" display="25:51" %}} - just be fair in in your conduct don't oppress and so on and so forth he was speaking to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1558" display="25:58" %}} - the the rulers in the nations of the world so when Jesus says um you are gods in that sense he's speaking to people  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1568" display="26:08" %}} - it's just like some of the conversations that we've had about uh um uh submitting to governments and all  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1577" display="26:17" %}} - of those in authority and stuff like that because essentially they have this divine right to command so to speak to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1588" display="26:28" %}} - expect to be obeyed so that's the sort of thing that Jesus is referring to if these ones to whom the word of God came  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1596" display="26:36" %}} - were gods and the scriptures cannot be broken he said how much more the one whom God sets apart for himself for him  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1606" display="26:46" %}} - as his very own and sent forth into the world that is to say if those ones are Gods you should know that I'm more than  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1615" display="26:55" %}} - they are I am actually the same as the father is they are gods in a derivative sense because they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1623" display="27:03" %}} - sharing in Divine Authority I'm not just sharing in Divine Authority I own it just as the father does mine is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1633" display="27:13" %}} - derivative is what he was saying and the works that he was doing Pro proved it that his word was  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1642" display="27:22" %}} - true yeah yeah right indeed um so couple other verses here that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1650" display="27:30" %}} - had added these this was the one I mean none of this that we're talking about is completely distinct from anything we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1657" display="27:37" %}} - talked about before uh which is why you know we're not maybe just not like paragraphs and paragraphs for each point  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1663" display="27:43" %}} - I had pulled in just a couple other verses um there's this verse in Colossians chapter 2 that talks about  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1669" display="27:49" %}} - how in Christ uh basically is the full the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form within the person of Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1677" display="27:57" %}} - right um whatever that means it it does not mean that Jesus is a separate God from  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1683" display="28:03" %}} - the father right um if you hold that point of view then what in the world does this verse mean it just doesn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1690" display="28:10" %}} - make sense right um also Philippians chapter 2 ver 6 um this says Jesus existed in the form of God and did not  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1700" display="28:20" %}} - regard equality with God a thing to be grasp right if Jesus were a separate God rather than being himself God you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1708" display="28:28" %}} - being a joint partaker of the same Essence as the father why how could we say that he exists in the form of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1715" display="28:35" %}} - what would that even mean it just doesn't make sense um so yeah just establishing the point here that once  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1723" display="28:43" %}} - again we're back to that interpretive um what I would say the principle of if you start trying to Monkey around with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1729" display="28:49" %}} - definition of the Trinity suddenly a whole bunch of passages in the Bible no longer make sense you know you have to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1735" display="28:55" %}} - go through great gymnastics to explain a way the fact that they seem to contradict  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1740" display="29:00" %}} - whatever interpretation you're pushing is these are just several examples of what in the world does John 10:30 mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1747" display="29:07" %}} - if Jesus is you know a being distinct from the father you know how can he be one with the father if he's a separate  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1753" display="29:13" %}} - being from the father it just doesn't make sense uh these other two verses that I pulled in here as well again  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1758" display="29:18" %}} - these weren't in the study directly I just thought they were good cross references neither of these really make  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1763" display="29:23" %}} - sense either if you say that Jesus is somehow a being with similar Essence to but not the same Essence as the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1769" display="29:29" %}} - that he's not one with the father he's just like the father then how is there one deity then  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1775" display="29:35" %}} - it just it doesn't compute it doesn't make sense and and we've argued before in this series that we've been going  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1781" display="29:41" %}} - through that that's the problem anytime you change around anything with a three person's one Essence bit of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1788" display="29:48" %}} - you you suddenly all these passes stop making sense and yeah that is like the clear message that you can't do that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1795" display="29:55" %}} - that that's just not true and that's why this idea that the Trinity somehow like is a derivative thing that we just like  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1802" display="30:02" %}} - made up after the fact or whatever just it it doesn't fly because the Trinity is all over the place in the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1808" display="30:08" %}} - Understanding the correct nature of the trinity in terms of what the Bible teaches isn't something that a church  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1814" display="30:14" %}} - Council like voted was true four centuries after the fact or whatever it's been true since the very beginning  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1820" display="30:20" %}} - since the New Testament was first penned and in fact since beginning of creation because God has always been this way and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1827" display="30:27" %}} - the B clearly speaks of him in this way so yeah yeah so uh now we're going to be talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1838" display="30:38" %}} - about adding the Holy Spirit to the mix here so we had previously just argued that the Bible makes it real clear that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1845" display="30:45" %}} - Jesus claims to be one with God he claims to be God in a way that is very distinct from somehow being like a  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1852" display="30:52" %}} - separate a separate God like on the same level as God the Father um but that Jesus claimed to be God um ontologically  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1861" display="31:01" %}} - speaking so to say um and so now we're going to be talking about the same concept as it applies to the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1867" display="31:07" %}} - and so uh the passage of the Bible that Dr lugan bille quotes here in the study is John chapter 14 vers 16 and 17 uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1876" display="31:16" %}} - which says I will ask the father so this is Jesus speaking I will ask the father and he will give you another comforter  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1881" display="31:21" %}} - to be with you forever the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive for it neither sees him nor knows him him  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1887" display="31:27" %}} - but you know him for he abides with you and will be in you um so to the point that we are establishing that the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1896" display="31:36" %}} - is one with the father and the son um you know we've used this passage previously um in our lessons here to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1902" display="31:42" %}} - establish that the spirit is a different person from the father and the son right because how can the son send himself or  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1910" display="31:50" %}} - how can you know or sorry how can the son request himself be sent and how can the father send himself you know so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1917" display="31:57" %}} - that's what we mean by the spirit's a separate person um there are some some other verses here that I brought up um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1923" display="32:03" %}} - but First Peter chapter 1 verse 21 is talking about inspiration and uh the inspiration of prophets uh it says that  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1932" display="32:12" %}} - no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1937" display="32:17" %}} - God equating the Holy Spirit and God right um also Acts chapter 5 um we we've talked about this passage before when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1946" display="32:26" %}} - were discussing that all three members of the Trinity were God which is really not a different point than what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1952" display="32:32" %}} - talking about in this lesson I mean sort of I suppose in how you phrase it but um all three members of the Trinity being  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1958" display="32:38" %}} - God implicitly means that all three you know members of the Trinity share the same Essence um but this is where um uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1966" display="32:46" %}} - when ananas and saf were holding back the proceeds from the land that they sold um it basically equates lying to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1974" display="32:54" %}} - the holy spirit with lying to God um directly and so again direct evidence that the holy spirit is God he's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1982" display="33:02" %}} - he's not a being similar in essence to the father and the son but he is God in the same way that the father is God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1990" display="33:10" %}} - the son is God but they are not each other um and finally uh this other verse that we've also talked about repeatedly  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="1998" display="33:18" %}} - in our lessons here um uh the Great Commission in Matthew chapter 28 talking about how we are baptized in the name of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2006" display="33:26" %}} - the father so we've talked before about how there's a single name it's one name in the Greek but it applies to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2012" display="33:32" %}} - father and the Son and the Holy Spirit so it's not the name of the father and then like a separate name for the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2018" display="33:38" %}} - and a separate name for the Holy Spirit but that same name applies to all three of them and it applies to all three of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2023" display="33:43" %}} - them equally without disparity here right they share this name which only makes sense if they are of the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2031" display="33:51" %}} - Essence if they are the same being um so um it's sort of like an amalgamation here of of points of verses that support  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2041" display="34:01" %}} - this concept but again this is not some great thing that we're establishing you know like we are completely turning  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2048" display="34:08" %}} - interpretation on his head or anything this is literally no more than just like the son the holy spirit is God he you  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2056" display="34:16" %}} - know he shares the same Essence with the father and the son they are joint partakers of the same Essence that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2062" display="34:22" %}} - terminology that you'll hear used and therefore they are all God they are all uh beings with the they  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2070" display="34:30" %}} - are one being with the same Essence um even though as this verse in John 14 makes clear they are different persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2078" display="34:38" %}} - um so do you have anything to add to any of this or like that's not much I mean I think we we  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2088" display="34:48" %}} - could go through a laundry list of of passages in the scriptures that show this the Holy Spirit acting as God being  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2096" display="34:56" %}} - addressed as God and speaking as God it's it's it's hardly I mean when these things actually begin to you know um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2108" display="35:08" %}} - really come into their own is in the face of opposition that's when we start to see that it makes no sense when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2116" display="35:16" %}} - read the Bible with some conception that the holy spirit is not God we've talked about um earlier how even if you were to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2127" display="35:27" %}} - go and use extreme translations of the Bible that were made specifically to attack the Trinity among other things  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2136" display="35:36" %}} - that that Christians believe for example the new world translation from Jehovah's Witnesses you will keep seeing that if  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2147" display="35:47" %}} - you were to try to eliminate biblical evidence for the deity of the Holy Spirit or of Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2157" display="35:57" %}} - Christ you end up in an intractable position where very little in the Bible makes sense and you find yourself  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2164" display="36:04" %}} - preaching things you don't actually claim to believe so for example in the matter of the sun they would say we  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2172" display="36:12" %}} - don't believe we're talking about the Jehovah's Witness we don't believe in uh polytheism there is only one God but  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2180" display="36:20" %}} - then they go right ahead and make Jesus a God in John 1 verse1 because they can't stand John 1 vers1 actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2188" display="36:28" %}} - reading that Jesus is God right so they have to make him a God now if you were to go to Hebrews where we have the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2196" display="36:36" %}} - Spirit speaking as God Hebrews chapter 3 I believe it was where he said um they may um how do they put it something like  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2207" display="36:47" %}} - um uh don't be like your fathers in the day that they had they they annoyed me or something like that he was speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2216" display="36:56" %}} - as if he was God now they don't even believe that the holy spirit is a person now how would they translate everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2225" display="37:05" %}} - that actually presents the Bible everything in the Bible that actually presents the Holy Spirit not only  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2232" display="37:12" %}} - speaking as a person but speaking as God I don't know how they would manage it when he is not even a person in their  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2238" display="37:18" %}} - view so we find that whenever you go to such extremes just as as um Steven has said you will find that a lot of things  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2247" display="37:27" %}} - in the Bible seize to make sense so it makes sense to take what the Bible says on its face that the father is God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2258" display="37:38" %}} - son is God the holy spirit is God the three of them are distinct individuals they are distinct persons in their own  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2267" display="37:47" %}} - right but they are not three different gods because the Bible declares without question that there is one God  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2277" display="37:57" %}} - so we have um a very solid uh proof in the as far as the scriptures go if we are taking the scriptures word for it  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2287" display="38:07" %}} - then the Holy Spirit definitely is God just like the father and the son both are as  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2295" display="38:15" %}} - well so just to that's the wrong one this set of slides here so this section that we've been going through today  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2302" display="38:22" %}} - talking about how they're all joint partakers of the same Essence um I just want to be C in case any people coming  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2308" display="38:28" %}} - behind in these lessons are wondering this this past lesson we did where we established that all three members of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2313" display="38:33" %}} - the Trinity are deity is actually the basically it's the same point that they're joint partakers of the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2319" display="38:39" %}} - Essence because when we say they are all God what we mean by that is that they are all the same being you know they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2326" display="38:46" %}} - all deity in the sense that they are God right so all these verses that we went through before are really you know like  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2333" display="38:53" %}} - all of these that teach the Trinity the father is God the son is God the holy spirit is god well all of these claims  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2340" display="39:00" %}} - that you know the father is deity and the son is deity and the Holy Spirit is deity that they're all God that they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2345" display="39:05" %}} - all addressed as God proper all of those really apply here as well um yeah um it's not it's not like um what I would  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2356" display="39:16" %}} - to say like the the mechanism is different here or whatever um so the reason why we're wording this this way  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2363" display="39:23" %}} - is the lesson right before this one we were talking about how they're co-equal co-eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2367" display="39:27" %}} - consubstantial they share that Essence right um and we're just basically this section has been worded in such a way  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2375" display="39:35" %}} - that we are opposing the notion of pantheons we are opposing the very idea that um the members of the Trinity are  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2385" display="39:45" %}} - separate Gods um but it's not really a fundamental different teaching than that all members of the Trinity are God it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2392" display="39:52" %}} - the same thing it's just opposing sort of a a different heresy um because the heresy that this this first set was kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2400" display="40:00" %}} - of getting at was for example saying that the son wasn't even God to begin with it's kind of a different way it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2405" display="40:05" %}} - kind of a different heresy than saying that the son is a God but just a different God than the father see what  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2410" display="40:10" %}} - I'm saying um yeah and and so that's kind of why the study was set up how it was I mean actually I can't pretend to  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2416" display="40:16" %}} - speak for Dr luging bill that's my guess because most of these sections have been of kind of organized in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2421" display="40:21" %}} - combating past heresy on these matters um but basically saying that all three members  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2428" display="40:28" %}} - of the Trinity are are deity is what the other section was getting at and that was dealing with for example Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2436" display="40:36" %}} - Christ was actually God not just a human being and he you know like the holy spirit is God as in you know like rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2444" display="40:44" %}} - than not being god um versus what we're talking about now are is that the father and the son and the spirit are all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2451" display="40:51" %}} - the same Essence which is also saying that they're all God but it's saying as a opposed to the son somehow being a  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2458" display="40:58" %}} - separate God from the father it's just a little bit of a different thing is all but all of the evidence to get us to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2465" display="41:05" %}} - right interpretation that the father and the son and the spirit all share one Essence and they are all God it's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2470" display="41:10" %}} - same it's the same general thing that's what I'm trying to say yeah yeah all right anything else on the spirit or is  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2478" display="41:18" %}} - that where we'll kind of cut it here for this point yeah I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2485" display="41:25" %}} - done all right so this lesson we have been examining how God is three in person but  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2493" display="41:33" %}} - that does not mean that the Trinity is composed of three or more different gods and kind of as I just closed on and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2500" display="41:40" %}} - very last thing we talked about was pointing out how this is a little bit of a distinct thing from talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2506" display="41:46" %}} - Divinity of Jesus Christ in the spirit for example in that we have been arguing that um we are not merely talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2514" display="41:54" %}} - um you know like the capability and status of the Son and the spirit but that they share the same Essence and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2520" display="42:00" %}} - that's sort of arguing against a different heresy than that Jesus wasn't even Divine to begin with like the arens  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2526" display="42:06" %}} - might say um so in this lesson we've gone through been establishing how uh the father is uh you know said to be God  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2534" display="42:14" %}} - as particularly uh you know even before we had more explicit Revelation in the New Testament um the Jewish people being  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2542" display="42:22" %}} - monotheistic made this such a shocking claim in the culture around them and then we talked about how Jesus very  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2549" display="42:29" %}} - obviously claims not to be a God but he claims to be God and this is part of the reason why um the crowds in John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2556" display="42:36" %}} - 10 you know sought to Stone him because they knew exactly what he was saying they knew what he meant and he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2561" display="42:41" %}} - claiming that he was God that he and the father are one so what John 10:30 says and then finally we talked about how um  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2569" display="42:49" %}} - the holy spirit is obviously God as well um verses that we've gone over before that establish the fact that he is god  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2575" display="42:55" %}} - um and how all of this ties back together to give us this notion that rather than being three separate beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2582" display="43:02" %}} - three separate Gods the Father the Son and the spirit are all the same being they are joint Partiers of the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2590" display="43:10" %}} - Essence right that's kind of what I titled this section joint partakers of the same Essence which is just kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2595" display="43:15" %}} - theological jargon for saying that they are one person United in essence even though they are three separate persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2603" display="43:23" %}} - um and so that is kind of where we are going to be wrapping up um the last uh of these lessons where we've been going  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2611" display="43:31" %}} - through uh kind of some things that the Trinity is not to kind of help throw into sharper relief uh what the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2618" display="43:38" %}} - actually teaches so that we can make better sense of that three person's one Essence um so we've been on that for uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2624" display="43:44" %}} - maybe three or four lessons now you know we've been going through some of these points about um the nature of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2629" display="43:49" %}} - Trinity and next we'll be moving on to kind of examining the Trinity a bit more in scripture and how God operates and  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2636" display="43:56" %}} - things like that so this is kind of a a uh soft uh not stop but a transition point for us in our study um as this  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2645" display="44:05" %}} - lesson kind of closes this section where we've been talking about um basically these these points uh about what the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2652" display="44:12" %}} - Trinity is not so with that um I hope um everyone picks up next time when we start diving a bit more into how the  
{{% timestamp videoId="LoKHW0rRxzU" time="2660" display="44:20" %}} - Trinity shows up in the Bible specifically
