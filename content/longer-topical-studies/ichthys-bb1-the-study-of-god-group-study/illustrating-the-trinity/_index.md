## Summary {#summary}

In this lesson we discuss illustrations that seek to help explain the Trinity. Since nothing in this created universe is truly like God, all of these illustrations are necessarily lacking in one way or another, and it is for this reason that we need to be quite wary of reading too much into them. If they help us better wrap our minds around the core teaching of the Trinity (namely, that God exists in three persons sharing one essence), then all to the good. However, we ought not ever build doctrine on top of things that are merely analogies, and analogies that are not even in scripture at that.

### Perils in attempting to use illustrations for the Trinity {#perils-in-attempting-to-use-illustrations-for-the-trinity}

{{< /subjects >}}

As we discussed in our last lesson, attempting to illustrate such a carefully protected doctrine as the Trinity has the potential of doing more harm than good. The fundamental problem with illustrations of the type we will consider in a moment is that they all necessarily contain potentially dangerous and untrue points of comparison, which, if too much stress be placed upon them, run the real risk of leading to heretical conclusions, a danger that far outweighs any good they may do in attempting to shed some light on the subject.

The number one objection to such illustrations is that God is divine, and since nothing and no one else is, *any* illustration will needs be imperfect and inaccurate (a fact which may well explain why no such illustrations occur in the Bible: Is.40:18). And there is more. Historically, Satan's attacks on the doctrine of the Trinity – a teaching crucial to the integrity of our Christian faith – have focused on the three-fold sovereign *personality* of God and/or His *deity* in three persons. But this reality of divine, triune personality is precisely the point that all illustrations of the Trinity miss (of necessity, since there is nothing "like" the Trinity).

<!-- --- -->

### An illustration from the early church: the Trinity "triangle" {#an-illustration-from-the-early-church-the-trinity-triangle}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-illustrations-trinity-triangle">Trinity > Illustrations > Trinity triangle</a>
{{< /subjects >}}

This oldest of the Trinity illustrations is also in many ways the best, because the non-doctrinal point of comparison (i.e., the triangle) merely serves to organize visually the meaning imparted by the words: all three members of the Trinity are God ("*one in essence*"), yet they are distinct from each other ("*three in person*"):

<!-- --- -->

### The illustration of the family of Man {#the-illustration-of-the-family-of-man}

Like the Trinity, mankind has multiple members, all possessed of similar, spiritual essences. But the Trinity *share* a unique, divine essence, and their triune unanimity of purpose is unlike anything in the realm of humanity.

<!-- --- -->

### The illustration of the human mind {#the-illustration-of-the-human-mind}

Like the Trinity, the mind can be said to be at once one thing, yet at the same time several things (intellect, emotion, conscience, etc.) and can dialogue with itself, and even be at cross-purposes with itself. But the Trinity is composed of distinct, divine personalities to which the inner-workings of our psyches make a poor comparison.

<!-- --- -->

### Illustrations from the world of nature {#illustrations-from-the-world-of-nature}

There are many things in the natural world that consist of distinct, multiple parts that at the same time constitute one complete whole. For example, distinguishable branches, roots and trunk are all part of one and the same tree, and eggs have three distinct parts (yolk, white and shell) without any of which three you would no longer have an egg. None of the illustrations of this sort really help to explain the unique personalities of the Trinity or their shared divine essence.

<!-- --- -->

### Illustrations from the physical realm {#illustrations-from-the-physical-realm}

This category of illustration contains some of the more interesting examples that have been used to explain the Trinity, though all suffer from the same objections that were lodged against the former category:

- Light is one yet distinct (and cf. God "being light"---1 John 1:5): radio is heard, visible light is seen, and infrared is felt
- The universe is one yet distinct: time, space, and matter
- Time is one yet distinct: past, present, and future
- Space is one yet distinct: length, breadth, and height
- Matter is one yet distinct: energy, matter, phenomnea

<!-- --- -->

### Conclusions: these illustrations are only the loosest of analogies at best {#conclusions-these-illustrations-are-only-the-loosest-of-analogies-at-best}

The most that can be said for the best of these illustrations is that to the extent that they remind us of the awesome wisdom and power of God in creating these complex, wonderful things (often taken for granted), they may also help us to realize that the Maker is likely to be even more complex and wonderful, and so accept what we know to be true about the Trinity ("one in essence, three in person"), even if it seems too complex and wonderful to fully grasp.

As we have said, however, care must be taken to see that none of these illustrations is taken too far, lest by attempting to understand "beyond what is written" we be led instead to dangerous and extra-biblical rationalizations based on these loose analogies. For the Trinity is often a good "litmus test" for our Christian faith. To accept it, one must accept not only the existence of God, but the distinctiveness and divinity of Jesus Christ, the true touch-stone principle that divides believers from unbelievers (1Jn.2:22-23). By distorting our understanding of the Trinity, the devil ultimately seeks to destroy our faith in Jesus Christ, the real focal point and rationale for satanic attacks that seek to confuse the issue of "one in essence, three in person".

{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - all right guys so this week in our lesson we are going to be talking about illustrating the Trinity so  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="6" display="00:06" %}} - illustrations for the kind of the concept and the doctrine of the Trinity and so these are the points that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="14" display="00:14" %}} - going to be going over today we're going to be talking about kind of how attempting to use illustrations for the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="19" display="00:19" %}} - Trinity is always somewhat perilous just because uh the Trinity is God God is divine there is nothing like him in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="28" display="00:28" %}} - created world so that means just simple what's the right word uh uh kind of process of elimination if  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="38" display="00:38" %}} - there's nothing like God well then necessarily all illustrations will lack some comparative power all of them will  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="45" display="00:45" %}} - be necessarily imperfect um and so on account of that we just need to be very very careful that we don't Place Focus  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="52" display="00:52" %}} - here on these and we don't try to draw doctrinal conclusions off of it and things like that and so actually this  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="59" display="00:59" %}} - this section in the study it's not so much teaching it's not so much trying to explain the trinity in terms of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="66" display="01:06" %}} - illustrations as it is trying to show how these illustrations are sort of necessarily insufficient and so um we'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="74" display="01:14" %}} - kind of see what that means a little bit more as we go on today but we're going to start off with a very early  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="79" display="01:19" %}} - illustration this comes up in the early church the so-called Trinity triangle which is just a visual representation of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="85" display="01:25" %}} - what we have already said that uh the father is God Jesus is God the spirit is God but the father is not the son or the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="93" display="01:33" %}} - spirit the son is not the father or the spirit and the spirit is not the father or the son um you know so the is and is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="100" display="01:40" %}} - not relationships now we're going to talk about the family of man so uh mankind the human mind illustrations  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="108" display="01:48" %}} - from the world of nature so this is like physical nature per se uh illustrations from the Physical Realm like light for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="116" display="01:56" %}} - example or the universe and then at the end we're going to kind of come back and touch on uh this point that we started  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="123" display="02:03" %}} - with that basically well there you go there are some of the illustrations that have been used across times and places  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="129" display="02:09" %}} - in history to try to help explain the Trinity and uh you shouldn't be very impressed basically um that is you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="137" display="02:17" %}} - we're going to kind of end where we started on this and uh not so much that we need to like look down our noses at  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="144" display="02:24" %}} - you know anyone who tries to say well just as God is three yet one so to in this other area maybe maybe it helps  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="152" display="02:32" %}} - right but the point is it's very dangerous to build Doctrine on it that's going to kind of be the fundamental  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="157" display="02:37" %}} - point that we try to make today all right so the first point uh that we are going to be starting with in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="167" display="02:47" %}} - our discussion here of illustrations for the Trinity is the kind of initial caveat the initial warning that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="173" display="02:53" %}} - mentioned going over how all of these illustrations are sort of going to be necessarily imperfect and so we did kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="181" display="03:01" %}} - of touch on this in our previous lesson here that that all attempts here to kind of illustrate such a Doctrine as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="189" display="03:09" %}} - Trinity which is so core and Central to our belief um uh just because of the importance of this there is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="197" display="03:17" %}} - potential there that this does more harm than good um so if your illustration is even a little bit off-center and people  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="204" display="03:24" %}} - read into it more than they should suddenly you might have harmed their understanding of the trinity because of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="210" display="03:30" %}} - how important that is that is kind of a very bad thing and so the fundamental problem with illustrations of kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="218" display="03:38" %}} - the type that we're going to be going over today is that if you take them too far if you put too much stress upon them  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="225" display="03:45" %}} - you do run the real risk of leading to heretical conclusions um and it's not going to be so direct uh in as much as  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="234" display="03:54" %}} - the second you look at one of these suddenly your entire understanding of God is going to become like overly  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="239" display="03:59" %}} - complicated you're not going to know heads from tals anymore it's that basically if you start reading into it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="246" display="04:06" %}} - if you start trying to make the analogy fit that's when you're going to run into problems and so the basic idea here is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="254" display="04:14" %}} - that uh it's it's really more like um we want to make sure that we don't do more harm than good right that Do no harm  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="261" display="04:21" %}} - principle that doctors sometimes um try to abide by um that is the sort of idea that we are going to be going into this  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="270" display="04:30" %}} - discussion with and uh the fundamental problem kind of mentioned this a little bit in the introduction there was that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="277" display="04:37" %}} - um the illustrations here are trying to illustrate a Divine being using things from the created realm and nothing in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="287" display="04:47" %}} - this creation is it all like God we have talked about this previously in discussing God's Essence um so uh uh his  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="296" display="04:56" %}} - uniqueness um his sovereignty within the material Universe there's no one else like God there is no other being no  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="303" display="05:03" %}} - other created thing that is at all like him um you know and that's in regard to his infinite nature and his perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="309" display="05:09" %}} - character as we have gone over in the past here and so that simply means Again by process of or the process of of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="317" display="05:17" %}} - elimination here that there is absolutely nothing that will serve as a good parallel as a truly good analogy  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="324" display="05:24" %}} - for God is that all of these things will necessarily fall short that doesn't mean that they're evil it just means that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="329" display="05:29" %}} - they're insufficient and there's kind of more to this even um Satan attacks the Trinity he always has um Satan's always  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="338" display="05:38" %}} - looking for ways to kind of interfere with our understanding of of God's truth and attacking the Divinity of Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="346" display="05:46" %}} - Christ the Divinity of any members of the Trinity or just the teaching of the trinity in general The three-fold  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="353" display="05:53" %}} - Sovereign personality of God and and the deity of the three persons all of these have always been kind of uh important  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="360" display="06:00" %}} - attack vectors in Satan's plan because if Satan can compromise someone on these issues they're just hop skip and a jump  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="367" display="06:07" %}} - away from compromising on what makes us Christian in fact depending on exactly what we mean by compromise getting  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="374" display="06:14" %}} - people to stumble here already uh kind of messes with the core beliefs that we need to hold as Christians and so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="383" display="06:23" %}} - problem with all this is that this Triune personality this is exactly the point that illustrations of Trinity Miss  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="390" display="06:30" %}} - like they cannot in any way do this right and so it's a little bit subtle here right you know rather than Satan uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="398" display="06:38" %}} - coming right up to someone and being like the Trinity is false and then most Christians would be kind of uh I guess  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="407" display="06:47" %}} - we we'd be primed to look at someone and say no it isn't because and and then you know go into an explanation of how the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="413" display="06:53" %}} - Bible talks about it like we've been talking about right it is we'd have a knee-jerk reaction to this but but when  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="420" display="07:00" %}} - someone else instead says the Trinity is like and then presents some example they're not so much attacking the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="427" display="07:07" %}} - Trinity headon as they are making this comparison and see this is why it's a little bit more subtle because if they  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="435" display="07:15" %}} - were attacking the Trinity headon we would recognize it for the challenge to correct doctrine that that such a thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="441" display="07:21" %}} - would be but when people instead give what I would call an imperfect comparison maybe we give them the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="447" display="07:27" %}} - benefit of the doubt more or we don't recognize it as being dangerous to our own understanding but if we buy into it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="455" display="07:35" %}} - it is still coloring our understanding of God because fundamentally if the first things out of our mouth are not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="461" display="07:41" %}} - something along the lines of God is divine and outside of SpaceTime and nothing is like him therefore we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="470" display="07:50" %}} - basically um trying to think about the right what it says you don't want to come off as hyper legalistic either the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="475" display="07:55" %}} - point needs to be nothing can truly compare to God so we need to discuss this Doctrine uh what I would call  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="481" display="08:01" %}} - theologically we need to treat it without kid gloves without trying to rationalize it as this thing that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="488" display="08:08" %}} - fundamentally incomprehensible in some sense to us as finite humans and we shouldn't apologize for that that's just  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="493" display="08:13" %}} - how it is that's what it means for God to be an infinite being outside of SpaceTime while we are finite beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="500" display="08:20" %}} - within SpaceTime like we're just never going to completely get it and we need to make peace with that rather than  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="505" display="08:25" %}} - trying to explain it all way so we need to always come in to discussions when such a thing would come up with that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="512" display="08:32" %}} - being the starting point and we again we shouldn't we shouldn't like shame people for it we should just stand firm on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="518" display="08:38" %}} - truth and the point that I'm saying here is that the comparisons due to the imperfection that is present in them we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="526" display="08:46" %}} - need to recognize them as dangerous we need to accept that if we actually look to them for teaching they can mislead us  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="534" display="08:54" %}} - and that is just kind of a different starting point than where some people may land on this thing and that's why  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="540" display="09:00" %}} - we're trying to make this point kind of more explicitly up front a do you have any thoughts you want to jump off of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="546" display="09:06" %}} - anything I said okay so yeah um I think that the bottom line is to keep in mind the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="558" display="09:18" %}} - danger of using any illustration but as with pretty much anything else in the Bible our job is to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="567" display="09:27" %}} - learn what the truth is and for us who are teachers our job is to teach and sometimes to teach you have to use  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="573" display="09:33" %}} - imperfect analogies I mean Lord Jesus was always doing that his Parables he would he would talk about things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="581" display="09:41" %}} - weren't exactly the thing he was talking about but there was something in those things that resonated with the realities  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="587" display="09:47" %}} - of which he spoke so for example he would say that the kingdom of God is like um uh Mustard Seed how about  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="596" display="09:56" %}} - mustard seed or I think particular one I was interested in is uh a bit of Leaven that you put in a loaf and it leavens  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="605" display="10:05" %}} - the whole lump you know something like that and you know you could push that really far and you'd have all sorts of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="613" display="10:13" %}} - problems with it I mean there are people today who are thinking and probably not necessarily because of that um uh that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="621" display="10:21" %}} - analogy that the kingdom of God is supposed to expand and keep expanding and basically they have this thing we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="628" display="10:28" %}} - call Dominion theology which is essentially that the world is going to get better and better and the church  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="633" display="10:33" %}} - will eventually consume it before the Lord Jesus will return Lord Jesus will return to a world that has turned to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="640" display="10:40" %}} - essentially that's what some people would make of that but in fact what he was saying was a completely different  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="645" display="10:45" %}} - thing which was it might be small at the moment when he was talking about the population of people who actually were  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="653" display="10:53" %}} - you know walking with the Lord there has always been a very small minority of people throughout the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="659" display="10:59" %}} - ages who have been walking with God but what he was saying is that now there was going to be an explosion and what was  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="667" display="11:07" %}} - hither to seemingly confined to Israel was going to spread throughout the entire world that was what he was  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="673" display="11:13" %}} - essentially saying but of course when you use that analogy you have to accommodate the fact that that analogy  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="679" display="11:19" %}} - is not the thing itself we will need these analogies we will need these illustrations just to get to wrap our  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="686" display="11:26" %}} - minds around something that would otherwise be inconceivable to us and the Lord has actually he built the world he  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="693" display="11:33" %}} - built this universe that we live in to tell us about himself that's a very important thing Psalm 19 and Revelation  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="701" display="11:41" %}} - and and Romans 1 both attest to this that the world in which we live tell tells us something  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="708" display="11:48" %}} - about what and who God is of course it doesn't give us the entire Revelation the Revelation it gives is very limited  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="718" display="11:58" %}} - but for someone who loves the truth and wants to know about the Lord you can use things in the world around you to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="726" display="12:06" %}} - appreciate and understand the Lord a bit more and for someone whose job it is to communicate the truth about the Lord to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="733" display="12:13" %}} - others you can use things in the world that people can relate to to understand some more about the Lord but we have to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="741" display="12:21" %}} - never forget that an analogy is no more than an an analogy and when you're comparing anything to God himself that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="750" display="12:30" %}} - is a necessarily flawed comparison because just as Steven said there is nothing in the universe that is quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="760" display="12:40" %}} - like God so we can only say in this way and in that way this thing could throw some light on something about God but we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="769" display="12:49" %}} - should not take the thing too far and come to to think of it in ways that are inappropriate that do not fit the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="777" display="12:57" %}} - Revelation that we have of the the Lord in the scriptures so um again not demonizing using  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="785" display="13:05" %}} - illustrations but certainly being cautious and reserved in our use of them I mean I just Ed Kind of a Funny  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="795" display="13:15" %}} - anecdote I'm sure many folks are aware of kind of the parable the of the sheep and the goats right talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="802" display="13:22" %}} - separation and last judgment there is nothing inherently evil about one or the other right as if one animal is like on  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="811" display="13:31" %}} - account of this physical characteristic or that physical characteristic you see what I'm saying like that is pushing the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - analogy quite a bit too far there's it's just the point is there will be a separation in the final judgment um yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="826" display="13:46" %}} - and yes I mean a lot of this things you would think would be common sense of no that's just an analogy it doesn't mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="833" display="13:53" %}} - what you're saying it means but people do go there so you know that is just Why we have to head off that sort of thing  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="840" display="14:00" %}} - now I will say just as perhaps giving a bit of intuition to why ought we be cautious in this you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="847" display="14:07" %}} - know like maybe you say what's the harm you know maybe maybe if it helps us so uh we we have touched on a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="853" display="14:13" %}} - how basically giving too much ear here it it tries to what I would call like physicalize God too much we try to fit  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="862" display="14:22" %}} - him into a box that we can understand but the thing is you shouldn't put God in a box because he doesn't live in one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="868" display="14:28" %}} - right he's Unbound um there's this interesting interplay this was brought up by someone when we paused briefly for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="875" display="14:35" %}} - a sec also with the idea of no graven images it's one of the Ten Commandments here right um what we do when we try to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="884" display="14:44" %}} - conceptualize God in a way that basically we have not been given leave to is we are trying to make an image of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="891" display="14:51" %}} - him um maybe it's not as obvious as I don't know you know like making a statue and calling it God but to the extent  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="899" display="14:59" %}} - that we try to make him physical we we make him bounded in the sense that we can then feel like we actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="907" display="15:07" %}} - understand him we have actually taken God and reduced him to something he is not um and yes that's the severity of it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="916" display="15:16" %}} - right it is you're breaking one of The Commandments here you know like it's not it's not like an oh shrug who cares sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="922" display="15:22" %}} - of thing it's a we need to respect God as we ought as the omnipotent creator of the universe who cannot be put into a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="931" display="15:31" %}} - physical box you just can't um if you if you call a physical box like that God you don't really understand well not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="939" display="15:39" %}} - that we will ever perfectly understand who God is but basically whatever conception you think you have is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="943" display="15:43" %}} - woefully insufficient right um yeah and that's just why it's not legalism here it's not legalism to say that we really  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="952" display="15:52" %}} - got to be careful not to go too far we really have to be careful what we say and what conclusions we draw it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="958" display="15:58" %}} - just cu we're trying to be pedantic or audite or academic and look down our noses at people it's because we do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="965" display="16:05" %}} - want to get in the habit of trying to make God physical trying to make him something that we can perfectly  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="972" display="16:12" %}} - understand and metabolize because that's not God it's just it's just not accurate um and the Bible itself weighs in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="980" display="16:20" %}} - against it so we don't need to be super shy about it is what I'm saying um yeah yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="987" display="16:27" %}} - great so the first of the actual illustrations that we are going to be using here comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="995" display="16:35" %}} - from the early church you know it is attested in in various places and in many ways this one is the safest of all  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1003" display="16:43" %}} - illustrations you might use because it's basically just a visual way to represent the information that we've already gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1010" display="16:50" %}} - over so I stole this picture off of VI this I did not make this picture um and you know it looks much the same no  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1016" display="16:56" %}} - matter where you get it from um but if you see God in the middle of the triangle um well the father is God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1024" display="17:04" %}} - son is God the holy spirit is God but you can see here based on these sides you know like the sides of the triangle  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1030" display="17:10" %}} - the father is not the son the father is not the spirit the spirit is not the father there spirit is not the son and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1036" display="17:16" %}} - then the son is not the spirit and the son is not the father so it just represents all of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1041" display="17:21" %}} - relationships that kind of get to what three persons in one Essence means you know that is that all three members of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1048" display="17:28" %}} - the trinity are God but they are not each other by personality so hence three persons one Essence um and so as I say  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1056" display="17:36" %}} - this is sort of the safe illustration um because it is visually representing the points that we need to teach when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1065" display="17:45" %}} - teach the Trinity um that they are all God and yet they are distinct from each other and it just puts it in a picture  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1071" display="17:51" %}} - basically so I'm a little bit I what's the right word it's not that this isn't an illustration because well it is kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1078" display="17:58" %}} - of a visual representation of it but I don't quite think of this in the same terms as I think of some of the rest of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1084" display="18:04" %}} - the things that we'll go over and you'll see a little bit more what I mean by that in in a moment but I actually think  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1090" display="18:10" %}} - this one is absolutely fine I even think it's a good thing for us to bring up when we teach on this just so that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1095" display="18:15" %}} - people can see it all in front of them you know maybe rather than reading three or four sentences they just look at the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1101" display="18:21" %}} - picture and they say ah that is what we mean when we say that the members of the Trinity are all God but they're not each  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1108" display="18:28" %}} - other um aie do you have thoughts on this initial  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1113" display="18:33" %}} - one yeah my my thought is exactly that I wish I had your optimism about people people are very interesting um there is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1123" display="18:43" %}} - a very popular um symbol so to speak out there in media in during the Illuminati Madness that the entire world  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1136" display="18:56" %}} - got engulfed in for a bit um that that that picture was very very big they had it's actually in in your in your dollar  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1145" display="19:05" %}} - bills I I don't know if it's just the $1 bill or the higher denominations but there was a pyramid with an eye on it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1154" display="19:14" %}} - right so exactly so people get caught up in things like that and you would be very surprised how people could make a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1163" display="19:23" %}} - triangle that's just explanatory it's not even there's nothing about it that should be special they can turn it into  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1170" display="19:30" %}} - something that it is not the human heart is very idolatrous incredibly idolatrous and that's what we're warning about  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1178" display="19:38" %}} - really we're saying the illustration is not the thing itself the illustration is not the Trinity illustration is not God  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1186" display="19:46" %}} - so don't get it into your mind that oh maybe because this is such a good representation of God triangles are  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1192" display="19:52" %}} - somehow mystical Divine yeah actually you know I know teaches about other places but you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1199" display="19:59" %}} - how the holy of holies in the temple is this perfect Cube we got more we got more evidence for that than we do  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1205" display="20:05" %}} - triangles is what I'm saying but even that is like not it's supposed to show the perfect equality of the three sides  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1212" display="20:12" %}} - in physical space it's still just it's still just an illustration right there's no power to it but exactly just for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1220" display="20:20" %}} - example another three-dimensional object that is mentioned in scripture doesn't mean that that is God right or that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1227" display="20:27" %}} - cubes are somehow holy and like I don't know trapezoids or or what's a I guess trapezoids are two dimensional not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1234" display="20:34" %}} - threedimensional aren't they but whatever you get the point that spheres are not holy because cubes are holy you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1239" display="20:39" %}} - see what I'm saying like that it's nonsense but yeah so we should we shouldn't get caught up in all of that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1246" display="20:46" %}} - is the point it's it's just a very good illustration it it doesn't mean anything more than that yeah all right well I  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1254" display="20:54" %}} - think that is mostly what we have to say on this one you know this one has less potential to lead astray I suppose  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1260" display="21:00" %}} - unless you get thinking that triangles are somehow Godly um but as long as you avoid that for the most part you're not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1267" display="21:07" %}} - gonna get off in using this one so in terms of the first what we might call actual analogy here um  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1279" display="21:19" %}} - previously we' just been talking about the Trinity triangle as a visual representation well we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1284" display="21:24" %}} - talking about the illustration of the family of man so of humanity or humankind here so like the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1292" display="21:32" %}} - mankind has multiple members all possessed of similar spiritual Essences but here's the difference the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1299" display="21:39" %}} - shares a unique Divine Essence and their triun UNAM unanimity of purpose is unlike anything in the realm of humanity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1307" display="21:47" %}} - and so we are of a kind as humans so my spiritual composition is like that of everyone else on this call is like that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1315" display="21:55" %}} - of everyone else in the world you know some s bil people over but the thing is we do not share an Essence so even  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1324" display="22:04" %}} - though we are similar and how we are made up spiritually we do not have a Unity of purpose we do not have a Unity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1330" display="22:10" %}} - of agreement asent our plans no matter how you slice it two human beings even identical twins who grew up in the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1339" display="22:19" %}} - set of circumstances with the same parents everything and they share the same goals they work at the same company  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1345" display="22:25" %}} - you can you can stack as many variables as you want and those two human beings will still not at all be United in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1355" display="22:35" %}} - way that gets us even close to how United the members of the Trinity are um and so hopefully you can see in some  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1363" display="22:43" %}} - senses all of us are human yet all of us are not the same is kind of sort of like you know there are three members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1372" display="22:52" %}} - Trinity but they're all God right but the problem where this one falls apart is that they're not not like they don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1379" display="22:59" %}} - all share you know similar makeup and are yet somehow distinct because the problem with this analogy in terms of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1387" display="23:07" %}} - some of the specific Doctrine we've talked about previously is that the whole concept of a Pantheon of three  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1394" display="23:14" %}} - Gods would kind of work with this one too right um but yet we know that is false and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1400" display="23:20" %}} - heretical so in some ways this analogy kind of gives us the wrong idea right aie you have anything you want to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1409" display="23:29" %}} - say yeah um you're right you're right the fact that um we human beings have certain qualities similar to the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1423" display="23:43" %}} - or that we can talk about the fact that the Trinity is made up of different persons just like mankind is made up of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1430" display="23:50" %}} - different persons ultimately leads to you know questions about why there are not three Gods I mean there are so many  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1438" display="23:58" %}} - different human beings and we can say human beings so if these are persons in their own right individuals in their own  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1447" display="24:07" %}} - right and forgive me if I'm not exactly hitting on what you were saying um but if when we see that dispar or  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1458" display="24:18" %}} - when we try to make that comparison it does lead to that disparity human beings are distinct from each other and not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1464" display="24:24" %}} - just distinct from each other we're not bound in that unit that we find in the Trinity so it leads people to eventually  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1473" display="24:33" %}} - when you start making those comparisons it can lead someone to you know getting the wrong idea of what the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1479" display="24:39" %}} - really is like they may be made the Trinity may be made up of three different individuals three distinct  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1487" display="24:47" %}} - individuals just like humanity is made up of so many different individuals but they're they share an  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1495" display="24:55" %}} - Essence in a way that we human beings don't share an Essence so we again we can get lost just making that comparison  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1507" display="25:07" %}} - looking at things in that light we should you know beware of it it's enough to say that the same way that I am a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1516" display="25:16" %}} - different person from Step my thoughts are my thoughts they're not Steven's thoughts the things I want to do may not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1525" display="25:25" %}} - be anything like what Stephen wants to do this is how we understand our individualism it is possible to carry  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1533" display="25:33" %}} - that analogy too far and expect to find the same thing in the Trinity if they are necessarily distinct  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1540" display="25:40" %}} - individuals but no what you will find in the Trinity is more along the lines of they share the same desires and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1550" display="25:50" %}} - whatnot they they are different individuals distinct from each other and yet there is no daylight between what  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1558" display="25:58" %}} - the father wants and what the son wants and what the spirit wants there is no difference between the way they perceive  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1566" display="26:06" %}} - reality so the father sees things the way the son does and the way the spirit does that would be difficult for us to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1574" display="26:14" %}} - wrap our minds around considering that human beings are not like that no human beings no two human beings are exactly  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1580" display="26:20" %}} - the same in their reasoning about anything in their conceptions of reality or in their aspirations life yes I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1589" display="26:29" %}} - you can get closer in some situations so I know it's two people not three but if you think about the love and care that a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1596" display="26:36" %}} - mother and a father have for their child like let's say it's about saving their child from certain harm they'd probably  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1603" display="26:43" %}} - be pretty United on that but all it takes to see that one fall apart so that's going from the family of man you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1610" display="26:50" %}} - know with large to perhaps the family of man in a nuclear family but when you think about disagreements parents have  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1616" display="26:56" %}} - about how to raise their children that Unity goes out the window immediately right but you could sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1622" display="27:02" %}} - see you can see flashes of it right you know because the loved care that a mother and a father have for their child  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1630" display="27:10" %}} - you know it's not like the Trinity is exactly like that but it is a more accurate reflection than some other  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1638" display="27:18" %}} - analogies right you know it's closer um that's the unity right um yeah and it's it's sort of a shadow of it I would say  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - yes yes and but but like you said when you look at that it it if if if we go I like the way that someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1657" display="27:37" %}} - actually put it on clubhouse he was saying to another person in a debate that the person was using anthropology  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1663" display="27:43" %}} - to interpret theology which which is just wrong God is not like man you could say man is like God because a lot a lot  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1674" display="27:54" %}} - of our quality a lot of what makes us human is based on what and who God is right so you could you could see how  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1683" display="28:03" %}} - we're modeled after God but God is Not modeled after us so we're going to find very quickly that a lot of things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1690" display="28:10" %}} - might apply because of our individuality because we are separate individuals from one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1697" display="28:17" %}} - another things that apply to us don't apply to God in terms of his own individuality so that's that's where we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1705" display="28:25" %}} - have to be very care careful about um the the connections that we have with each other but like you said it is true  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1716" display="28:36" %}} - that we can have things that look very similar to the unity that they have the a mother and a father having a child and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1724" display="28:44" %}} - wanting the best for their child they want to raise their child right and all of that they can synchronize in their  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1730" display="28:50" %}} - thoughts through discussion and whatnot but we should not think that because they can do that that they Unity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1737" display="28:57" %}} - of the Trinity is similar to that that the father and son and and the spirit sit down in a conference and try to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1743" display="29:03" %}} - marry their thoughts with each other and figure out how I basically reach some compromise over how things ought to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1751" display="29:11" %}} - it doesn't work you know what maybe the best way to say this hopefully this gets a chuckle out of people is that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1756" display="29:16" %}} - universe is not ruled by a committee let's put it like that right exactly that is the wrong way to think about it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1764" display="29:24" %}} - um yeah so the Trinity is not a comedy that it's it's it's certainly not that's one thing we should keep in mind yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1772" display="29:32" %}} - yeah so now this is what we mean um and we'll kind of return to this point as we go through these you know all of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1779" display="29:39" %}} - illustrations but I hope you can see how you can sort of see bits and bits and flashes and shadows here of maybe kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1788" display="29:48" %}} - of how we can see parallels but it should be clear I hope that this cannot capture really who got is what God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1798" display="29:58" %}} - because it's just not complete right um yeah the information is not complete that's just it we don't have all of it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1807" display="30:07" %}} - yeah yeah we can't handle it if it were so there that goes yep so that is our first example  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1818" display="30:18" %}} - here so now we are going to be talking about the illustration of the human mind so like the Trinity the mind can be to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1827" display="30:27" %}} - be at once one thing yet at the same time several things such as intellect emotion  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1833" display="30:33" %}} - Consciousness and C sorry Etc and can dialogue with itself and even be it cross purposes with itself but the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1841" display="30:41" %}} - Trinity is composed of distinct Divine personalities to which the inner workings of our psyches make a poor  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1846" display="30:46" %}} - comparison now in this particular one we as human beings we are individuals so we are made up of Flesh and spirit but if  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1856" display="30:56" %}} - you ever read galatian chapter 5 ought to be pretty clear that you know the Flesh and the spirit are it polar you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1864" display="31:04" %}} - know they're always at each other's throat that's Galatians 5:17 um you know they oppose one another what Unity right  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1872" display="31:12" %}} - um so even when you think about this um one tension that you will see come up quite a lot um in what we might term  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1880" display="31:20" %}} - philosophy it's just it's a theme in literary writing is what we might term intellect and logic versus emotion right  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1887" display="31:27" %}} - um uh unfortunately sometimes this tends to get stereotyped across gender lines more than is probably appropriate uh I.E  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1896" display="31:36" %}} - men are not always terribly logical and women are not always terribly emotional to the point that it interferes with  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1901" display="31:41" %}} - logic but this tension there does exist within us as humans um and you know we know as Christians that we ought not let  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1910" display="31:50" %}} - our emotions lead and you know at the same time we know that you know certain things that might seem on the surface to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1917" display="31:57" %}} - be logical are in fact great evil right so Eugenics for example we're say we're only going to let the really smart  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1924" display="32:04" %}} - people reproduce does not lead to Ideal Utopias right that is a very immoral sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1932" display="32:12" %}} - thing to believe in um and so that's what we mean here by the human mind you know we are composed of these multiple  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1940" display="32:20" %}} - elements um well in as much as I don't know psychologists and stuff name certain aspect of what they call the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1948" display="32:28" %}} - human psyche all of them together they don't have a Unity of purpose um and you know I would say of illustrations this  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1958" display="32:38" %}} - one I think sort of self-evidently um how do you even identify uh the people in play here  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1966" display="32:46" %}} - shall we say um you know intellect and emotion I just gave a couple examples of kind of the two sides of the road both  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1973" display="32:53" %}} - leading to a ditch when it comes to that but conscience for example um you know all of these  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1980" display="33:00" %}} - other things that compete desire perhaps would be another one or will or I mean philosophers have all sorts of names for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1990" display="33:10" %}} - philosophy of Mind type Concepts but um a you want to go on anything else before I say anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="1996" display="33:16" %}} - more yeah um yeah the like you said the human mind is a composition of multiple things all  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2006" display="33:26" %}} - of us have feelings we we we experience emotion all of us also experience thought um and we know it as a separate  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2014" display="33:34" %}} - thing from feeling because I mean you might not feel very you might not have much in the way of feeling when you are  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2023" display="33:43" %}} - trying to make some mathematical computation or something you're thinking when you're doing that and sometimes you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2029" display="33:49" %}} - have to make a lot of dispassionate decisions that where your emotions don't really come into  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2035" display="33:55" %}} - play but we you know that when you have feelings and emotions there are still you know qualities of the mind that you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2043" display="34:03" %}} - express and then when you have to weigh um moral situations that's still something that your mind you know does  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2052" display="34:12" %}} - so all of these things are aspects of our like you said psyche that in that same way we can we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2059" display="34:19" %}} - can say that the the Trinity is multiple people but one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2067" display="34:27" %}} - just like the mind is one you don't think of your emotions and your thoughts as maybe being from  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2077" display="34:37" %}} - different sources like it's not your mind one is your mind and the other is something else we talk about the mind  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2083" display="34:43" %}} - and the heart that's some that's poetical and whatnot but we do know that whether you're talking about the mind or  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2090" display="34:50" %}} - the heart we're talking about something the seat of human being the person of the human being this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2099" display="34:59" %}} - where all of this stuff goes on our moral judgment our our our thinking our intellect our feeling and whatever else  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2108" display="35:08" %}} - happens in this place this is it's all one thing happening in one place right so we get that all of this somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2117" display="35:17" %}} - speaks to what the Trinity is like and The Trinity is multiple people multiple persons but also one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2127" display="35:27" %}} - it's one it's it's not a divided thing because it's multiple persons but of course the analogy breaks down when you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2136" display="35:36" %}} - see that in fact your intellect and your emotions are not always aligned I mean you can be for example in love with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2145" display="35:45" %}} - wrong person and you know it's the wrong person because all you have to do is think about it for a second someone who  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2152" display="35:52" %}} - is absolutely wrong for you in every sense of that that word and yet your emotions  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2158" display="35:58" %}} - go like I don't care that's the person I want end of story you're going to die from this but yeah so what I still want  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2168" display="36:08" %}} - it that happens and then your moral judgment I think everybody knows this point you know that your moral judgment  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2174" display="36:14" %}} - is telling you this is just not the thing for you to do it's just wrong on all levels and you're like yeah but I  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2182" display="36:22" %}} - still want it and you can actually set your intellect against your your moral judgment so when you consider this this  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2188" display="36:28" %}} - is still one mind the human mind where all of this conflict is occurring so even though it's one thing that has  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2198" display="36:38" %}} - multiple Expressions if you will or multiple aspects to it it's still in Conflict a thing that is not the case  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2206" display="36:46" %}} - with the Trinity there is never any conflict in the Trinity contrast I think a good word to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2214" display="36:54" %}} - use here is peace right we understand that the only way we get peace is through the indwelling of the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2221" display="37:01" %}} - Spirit when we submit to God but it's like a sharp contrast right we our minds are fundamentally without God are not at  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2230" display="37:10" %}} - peace you know like we literally call it the battlefield of the heart yeah so tell me people who use this analogy do  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2238" display="37:18" %}} - you want to say that the members of the Trinity are at war with each other you know you can see I'm being somewhat  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2244" display="37:24" %}} - vicious here but like this is again it's like well if we can't say that then what uses the analogy right past a certain  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2252" display="37:32" %}} - point yeah it just it isn't because it's not descriptive of God it doesn't work um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2258" display="37:38" %}} - so yeah there's multiple things that are at the same time distinct yet one but not like the Trinity is um so and we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2268" display="37:48" %}} - just gonna we're gonna harp on that over and over again as we go through these just because that is the core Point here  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2272" display="37:52" %}} - is that you can see bits and flashes but it doesn't completely work um yeah yeah that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2285" display="38:05" %}} - point next we're going to look at illustrations from the world of nature so we're not talking so much about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2292" display="38:12" %}} - physical Universe in terms of what we might call Natural laws and phenomena here as we are talking about like I  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2299" display="38:19" %}} - don't know think like forest trees waterfalls that sort of thing um so there's many things in the natural world  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2304" display="38:24" %}} - that consist of distinct multip parts that at the same time constitute one complete whole so distinguishable  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2311" display="38:31" %}} - branches roots and trunk are all part of one and the same tree for example and here's a pretty famous analogy uh eggs  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2319" display="38:39" %}} - have three distinct Parts yoke white and shell without any which of the three you would no longer have an egg none of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2326" display="38:46" %}} - these illustrations really help to explain the unique personalities of the Trinity or shared Divine Essence so what  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2334" display="38:54" %}} - we might say by that is that you know if we were to say that uh yoke is egg and white is egg and shell is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2344" display="39:04" %}} - egg it kind of doesn't work perfectly because technically speaking the yoke is only like one out of three parts of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2352" display="39:12" %}} - egg right and so I don't know how far you want to push that so you say is God God if he's not try you I mean like what  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2360" display="39:20" %}} - is the essence of deity but where I'm going with this is that even even if you accept okay you know what these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2368" display="39:28" %}} - at least get to that idea of multiple components each making up one hole it says absolutely nothing about  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2376" display="39:36" %}} - the persons in the Trinity right so uh just not to put you fine a point on it but if you say God is like eggs people  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2384" display="39:44" %}} - are gonna look at you and be like what do you mean you know like you see what I'm saying because like it just it that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2392" display="39:52" %}} - particular statement is not what I would call didactically helpful right if you say God is like an egg and you say it as  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2400" display="40:00" %}} - though it means something Grand someone's gonna ask you but Mr teacher sir what am I supposed to get out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2408" display="40:08" %}} - that you know like and see that's the problem here because the second is now you have to start explaining Divine  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2415" display="40:15" %}} - personalities eggs don't have Divine personalities right um eggs don't have any personalities at all because eggs  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2421" display="40:21" %}} - are immaterial objects um it just like it it's not I I should say that you know some of the other things we've been  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2429" display="40:29" %}} - talking about I think actually like can really like like they don't fit because of what we might call serious comparison  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2440" display="40:40" %}} - problems like the mind that we were just talking about the battlefield of the heart is really really different from  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2445" display="40:45" %}} - the unity that the members of the Trinity share these aren't so much really really different as it's kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2451" display="40:51" %}} - like trying to explain something with an analogy that doesn't really work you know so I don't know if you've ever had  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2458" display="40:58" %}} - a coworker or a friend or something you know they're like telling a story or they're trying to use an example and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2465" display="41:05" %}} - they just like pick a really bad example so that whatever they're trying to explain like just doesn't follow from it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2472" display="41:12" %}} - um this happened to me before you know or they they just like or in an argument someone is making an argument and they  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2479" display="41:19" %}} - pick something to support their evidence that just like does not follow right um so today is today is Tuesday therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2490" display="41:30" %}} - it will rain you know like those two things are causally unrelated it it doesn't doesn't make sense right um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2498" display="41:38" %}} - and to me that is closer to what this is than anything else is that not so much that these things are  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2504" display="41:44" %}} - like like they're not gonna give you the wrong idea so much as that you just don't get any idea at all because like  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2509" display="41:49" %}} - they're just not the same you know like eggs to be to be very clear eggs are not like human beings either because eggs  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2516" display="41:56" %}} - immaterial objects they don't have personality or will right yeah it's non- living things and you know like it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2522" display="42:02" %}} - just not the same um so how the analogy might help when we're talking about eggs for example is still speaking to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2531" display="42:11" %}} - fact that God is one you know so it's it's not it's not the best analogy but you can see  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2539" display="42:19" %}} - how something that has multiple Parts is still one it's it's it's not multiple things it's one thing but of course  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2550" display="42:30" %}} - where the analogy breaks down as all analogies break down I mean anyone who has written anything in this world would  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2557" display="42:37" %}} - would say that it's it's a very common thing on all analogies breakdown so this is not one of the best possible  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2563" display="42:43" %}} - analogies you could make but it still points to one thing where you have multiple things and those multiple  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2572" display="42:52" %}} - things are one thing now the analogy breaks down in that neither of them is really the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2578" display="42:58" %}} - complete egg so uh if if you were to remove the yolk is the yolk the egg well the yolk is part of an egg without the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2588" display="43:08" %}} - yolk do you really have an egg um the white without the white do you really have an egg without the shell well do  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2598" display="43:18" %}} - you really have an egg all of these things together you know speak to the egg the egg is all these things and none  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2607" display="43:27" %}} - of these things but but then that's where the analogy breaks down the father is God the spirit is God the son is God  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2616" display="43:36" %}} - they're all individually God they're not parts of God so clearly the analogy here breaks down in that the yoke is not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2628" display="43:48" %}} - egg but without the Yoke you don't have an egg so we see I mean I'm not even sure I  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2635" display="43:55" %}} - would go so far as to dive into the specifics here in terms of what we might term ontology just because when you do  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2642" display="44:02" %}} - that you're kind of already going down this path of philosophizing the egg into a being with what what we would call UIA  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2651" display="44:11" %}} - that's the Greek word for being like it's just they like I said it's two things of a different class so it's like  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2657" display="44:17" %}} - if you're playing 20 questions with someone and you say mineral but you're thinking of a carrot right like it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2664" display="44:24" %}} - I'm just saying that they're not they're not too things of a kind is what I'm saying yeah they're not even close um  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2670" display="44:30" %}} - there's a point I've been wanting to make for a little bit but I I kept I kept forgetting it it was essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2676" display="44:36" %}} - this that when we are making these analogies um I hope I I haven't forgotten it again when we're making  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2684" display="44:44" %}} - these analogies when we're talking about these things the goal is to is to show us what we have talked about once that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2693" display="44:53" %}} - even though a lot of things about God super logical in the sense that they are beyond our ability to reason they're not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2702" display="45:02" %}} - illogical in that they don't even you know fit into what makes sense so to speak they  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2713" display="45:13" %}} - do make sense but the thing is we don't have enough information to fully comprehend it to fully understand it so  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2721" display="45:21" %}} - um besides we don't have the ability to even understand that information if we had it so likewise the argument that one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2729" display="45:29" %}} - could make with respect to any analogy we're making is it's not out of place to conceive of something like the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2738" display="45:38" %}} - it's not an an illogical concept it's just not one we can fully grasp because when you look into our experience as  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2746" display="45:46" %}} - human beings limited by time and space and Immortal body we can see things in our experience that say oh something  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2755" display="45:55" %}} - like like this is possible even though clearly it is not this so we can say this thing we're talking about is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2766" display="46:06" %}} - beyond the limit of of possibility it's not one of those things that are absurd it's just too much to fully comprehend  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2776" display="46:16" %}} - well so yeah it doesn't derive a logical contradiction perhaps a way and I would say that the problem is if you word  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2784" display="46:24" %}} - things a certain way that's where people run into trouble they say God is one yet God is three but what do they mean by  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2791" display="46:31" %}} - God is one and what do they mean by God is three because that's why you can't omit the persons in the essence from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2797" display="46:37" %}} - definition of the Trinity because if you say God is one yet God is three that's the that's the definition of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2804" display="46:44" %}} - you've omitted The crucial information that the teaching of the Trinity is that God is one in essence and three in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2811" display="46:51" %}} - person and you can't leave those things out because yeah otherwise like what what you're saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2819" display="46:59" %}} - what depends what you mean right because that statement actually one does not equal three in terms of numerical Logic  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2826" display="47:06" %}} - for example but that's not what we're claiming is the thing we're not claiming that God is one person and three people  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2833" display="47:13" %}} - that is the equivalency that would derive a logical contradiction right yes yes exactly the two things are not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2840" display="47:20" %}} - same we're not talking about the same thing on two sides of an equation right we're not talking about God has one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2846" display="47:26" %}} - Essence yet God has three Essences or God is one person yet God is three people we are saying neither of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2852" display="47:32" %}} - things we are saying that God has one Essence but he is three persons see what I'm saying and therefore there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2859" display="47:39" %}} - logical contradiction not inherent in logic it's just hard to understand that's all um because there is nothing  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2867" display="47:47" %}} - else that is multiple persons from the same Essence in all of existence right that's that that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2874" display="47:54" %}} - literally all there is to it but ai's point is very important and we should emphasize that reemphasize it the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2880" display="48:00" %}} - Trinity is not an illogical Doctrine it is just outside the scope of human experience and understanding because we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2887" display="48:07" %}} - are finite beings don't really understand what an eternal existence is much less Eternal Unity of will things  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2896" display="48:16" %}} - like this we just kind of can't sink our fingers into it past a certain point because it's outside the scope of our  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2902" display="48:22" %}} - experience but that's very different from it being iCal in a formal logic sense yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2914" display="48:34" %}} - yeah all right so the next type of illustration we're going to be talking about here that people sometimes use in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2921" display="48:41" %}} - discussing the Trinity uh is the illustrations coming from the Physical Realm so this category of illustration  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2929" display="48:49" %}} - for the Trinity contains some of the perhaps more interesting examples that have ever been used when people have  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2935" display="48:55" %}} - tried to map things from the material Universe uh onto the Trinity to help us kind of understand it contextualize it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2943" display="49:03" %}} - uh in material terms but they all suffer from the same objections that were lodged against the former category that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2950" display="49:10" %}} - is you know when we were talking about things from nature like an egg which has the Yol the White and the shell for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2956" display="49:16" %}} - example um any of which three you would no longer have an egg but the problem with this sort like we had said was that  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2964" display="49:24" %}} - none of these illustrations really help explain the personalities of the Trinity because while it is true that without  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2970" display="49:30" %}} - any of those three things you no longer have an egg which is good you know because that's true of the Trinity as  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2975" display="49:35" %}} - well if you don't have Jesus it's not the Trinity if you don't have the father it's not the Trinity if you don't have  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2979" display="49:39" %}} - the son it's not the Trinity but you know an egg yoke doesn't have personality so um it it it's limited in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2986" display="49:46" %}} - its power to describe exactly how the Trinity works and like we said this is just true across the board for all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="2993" display="49:53" %}} - our illustrations because none of them them can properly capture you know the Divine being of God who external  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3000" display="50:00" %}} - SpaceTime they just can't um so these illustrations here unlike nature where you know the egg was one of the examples  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3007" display="50:07" %}} - we used we have several examples here so uh maybe starting out with an easy one uh light is one yet distinct and we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3017" display="50:17" %}} - might also compare actually God being light coming from 1 John 1 verse5 um that God is light and in him there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3025" display="50:25" %}} - Darkness so God has actually described as being light but you don't want to push this one too far in saying that uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3031" display="50:31" %}} - so when we say that light is one yet distinct we're primarily talking about wavelengths here so if anyone remembers  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3038" display="50:38" %}} - back to their physics class we know that a radio is you know uh a electromagnetic radiation of a specific wavelength on  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3047" display="50:47" %}} - the Spectrum Radio is heard or well I mean we don't hear it with our ears but you know like you know E Equipment can  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3057" display="50:57" %}} - uh you know take the radio waves and convert them into sound um because sound waves are a different type of wave than  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3061" display="51:01" %}} - electromagnetic but radio is heard visible light is seen so you might think uh across the rainbow Spectrum uh so red  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3070" display="51:10" %}} - light on one end and blue light on the other actually have different wavelengths um so unless I'm M I believe  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3077" display="51:17" %}} - I'd have to actually go look but I think red wav is like a longer wavelength and blue is uh shorter wavelength maybe blue  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3084" display="51:24" %}} - is higher frequency I don't remember blue light has more energy I remember that from physics um but infrared is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3090" display="51:30" %}} - another type of electromagnetic radiation so all of these things we can call light yet no one of them has like a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3100" display="51:40" %}} - monopoly on light right they're all equally light yet they're not the same uh like they're not equivalent to each  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3107" display="51:47" %}} - other right so that's in the same way this is where the analogy part comes in the father is God and the spirit is God  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3114" display="51:54" %}} - and the son is God but they are not each other in the same way that radio is light visible light is light and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3121" display="52:01" %}} - infrared is light or electromag electromagnetic radiation if you prefer but all of those things are not each  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3129" display="52:09" %}} - other um so uh just more examples here we say the universe is one yet distinct in that the universe is composed of time  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3138" display="52:18" %}} - space and matter and all of those things are the universe but time is not space and space is not matter and matter is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3144" display="52:24" %}} - not time right um time is one yet distinct past present and future and all of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3151" display="52:31" %}} - things are time yet past is not present and present is not future and future is not past same thing with space length  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3159" display="52:39" %}} - breadth and height all of those things are dimensions within space but length is not breadth and breadth is not height  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3165" display="52:45" %}} - and height is not length and also with matter itself so this one I don't know again physics if you recall in your  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3174" display="52:54" %}} - heads you know there's an a very famous equation from Einstein e equals mc² right um You might remember this um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3182" display="53:02" %}} - energy and matter are related to each other in terms of the physical universe and the well I misspelled that word  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3189" display="53:09" %}} - there that should be phenomena not phenomia that's that's not a word phenomena um so matter is one yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3197" display="53:17" %}} - distinct energy matter and phenomena and energy is not matter matter is not phenomena phenomena is not energy  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3202" display="53:22" %}} - there's three things right all of these examp here they get at this sense that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3209" display="53:29" %}} - father and the son and the spirit are all God but yet they're not each other but just like we talked about before  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3216" display="53:36" %}} - with nature the problem is is that none of these things are personal they're not individuals like it's not like time  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - space and matter have Personalities in the same way that the members of the Trinity do they don't have Personalities  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3230" display="53:50" %}} - in the sense that we humans have personalities but they have a will they are person  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3236" display="53:56" %}} - um and so that's where these analogies kind of fall down just like the past on we've talked about a you have anything  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3243" display="54:03" %}} - you want to contribute uh in this discussion here okay um not not much really I think you have covered the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3250" display="54:10" %}} - grounds like we've said before that all illustrations that we make about the Trinity are necessarily going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3259" display="54:19" %}} - flowed they're all illustrations they cannot be anything other than illustrations so in some way they will  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3266" display="54:26" %}} - give some insight into how the Trinity works but um beyond that we might we will find that those illustrations like  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3274" display="54:34" %}} - every other analogy will break down so that is um what we need to know but like like we said they're very useful to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3283" display="54:43" %}} - understand some aspect or other of the Trinity I don't think there is much more to say or do regarding um how the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3293" display="54:53" %}} - thing works but you have covered it pretty nice all right so before we get back to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3302" display="55:02" %}} - the outline to kind of go over all that we've talked about we're just going to close out kind of uh ending where we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3308" display="55:08" %}} - started talking about the basically some of the caveats to bear in mind when we are discussing these illustrations for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3315" display="55:15" %}} - the Trinity and kind of the just the concept in general of coming up with these analogies to try to help us  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3320" display="55:20" %}} - understand so the most that can be said for the best of these illustrations is to the extent that they remind us of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3327" display="55:27" %}} - awesome wisdom and power of God in creating all of these things that we're talking about um and we may often take  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3333" display="55:33" %}} - this for granted as we go through life uh you know just thinking about the enormity of the universe and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3339" display="55:39" %}} - magnificence of God's creation you know we probably ought to ponder that a little bit more just generally speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3346" display="55:46" %}} - however all of those things you know in as much as they may help us realize that God is going to be even greater than  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3356" display="55:56" %}} - what he has made you know that's a positive thing they can help point us to him this is in fact very much what  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3362" display="56:02" %}} - natural Revelation generally is you know as talked about in Romans chapter 1 vers 18 and following or Psalm chapter 19 uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3371" display="56:11" %}} - we know God we know certain aspects about uh his character and his divinity through that which has been made um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3379" display="56:19" %}} - so in as much as these things point us to God and we know um you know we can refer things based upon that just  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3386" display="56:26" %}} - through the natural world and some of these created things you know we talked about nature here and uh just things  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3392" display="56:32" %}} - from the Physical Realm uh creation generally um well these things can be good in as much as they point us to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3400" display="56:40" %}} - as the Creator um and so um they may help us realize that God is going to be even bigger even more complex even more  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3409" display="56:49" %}} - wonderful than the things that he has created um and so if they help us accept what we already know to be true about  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3415" display="56:55" %}} - the Trinity and again as we have kind of hammered home time and again the doctrine of the Trinity is basically one  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3423" display="57:03" %}} - in essence three in person or three in person or one in essence whichever order you prefer those things together compose  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3429" display="57:09" %}} - the teaching of what we say we believe and so if these things help us grasp that or accept it more easily what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3437" display="57:17" %}} - know to be true from what the Bible tells us then okay that's fine right basically this is best case right right  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3445" display="57:25" %}} - um and so we're never going to completely grasp this you know we've been over this before too um even if it  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3451" display="57:31" %}} - seems too complex and wonderful for us to fully grasp as humans that's a limitation of our flesh of our Earthly  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3457" display="57:37" %}} - perspective given that we are very finite beings in SpaceTime on the other side we will know more as we are known  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3464" display="57:44" %}} - the terminology the Bible uses but nonetheless right now we have this very limited perspective that we are going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3470" display="57:50" %}} - be kind of stuck with until uh we join God and Jesus on the other side and all of our brothers and sisters who've gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3479" display="57:59" %}} - before us um however and again that was best case scenario however uh you can run into problems here as well we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3487" display="58:07" %}} - to take care that none of these illustrations are taken too far we have kind of been over this before uh when  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3493" display="58:13" %}} - you think about the interpretation of Parables so you have the parable of the wheat and the tears well we are not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3499" display="58:19" %}} - actually literally wheat you cannot take certain physical properties of wheat and start making suppositions and hypoth  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3505" display="58:25" %}} - based on them um and that's sort of the same thing here um and the idea is basically if we go beyond what is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3513" display="58:33" %}} - written uh we can be led to dangerous and extra biblical rationalization based upon analogies we cannot reason about  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3521" display="58:41" %}} - the nature of God based upon characteristics of eggs you know just to go back to the nature example God is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3528" display="58:48" %}} - an egg right in as much as we use the egg to try to explain how there are these three parts any one of which if  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3534" display="58:54" %}} - you take it away is no longer an egg you know if we try to use that to help us understand the Trinity maybe you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3541" display="59:01" %}} - like we said best case maybe it helps us appreciate the complexity and the Majesty of God but you can't you know go  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3547" display="59:07" %}} - start trying to put God in a box based on characteristics of eggs that's kind of what we're getting at here um and The  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3554" display="59:14" %}} - Trinity here um this is kind of taking a step back into the wider context the Trinity is very often a good litmus test  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3561" display="59:21" %}} - for our Christian faith um because to AC the Trinity you have to accept not only the existence of God but also the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3569" display="59:29" %}} - distinctiveness and Divinity of Jesus Christ that is he's a different person than the father but he is also God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3575" display="59:35" %}} - that's kind of the true Touchstone principle that divides us as Believers from unbelievers that Jesus uh fully God  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3582" display="59:42" %}} - yet fully man came down into the world um paid for our sins upon the cross that we might have redemption and forgiveness  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3589" display="59:49" %}} - through his blood you know that's the essence of the Gospel message and so this is why Satan spends so many  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3596" display="59:56" %}} - resources attacking this Doctrine in particular is because by distorting our understanding of the Trinity the devil  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3603" display="01:00:03" %}} - ultimately seeks to destroy our faith in Jesus Christ uh you know specifically we would say who he is the who he is part  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3609" display="01:00:09" %}} - of Jesus Christ but you know our entire understanding of redemption of how Jesus Paid for our sin it doesn't work if he  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3617" display="01:00:17" %}} - wasn't God and this is why this is so so so important for us as Christians because the Divinity of Jesus and how he  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3624" display="01:00:24" %}} - was God is God and yet he took on a human nature to become the perfect sacrifice for our sins it's as  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3631" display="01:00:31" %}} - foundational as you get in Christianity basically and so that's why Satan spends time attacking this um and again this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3640" display="01:00:40" %}} - just Why well you know by way of warning we are saying we have to be careful not to go beyond what is written not to push  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3647" display="01:00:47" %}} - analogies and and by the way these have going against them that most of these aren't even biblical analogies they're  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3652" display="01:00:52" %}} - just analogies people have come up with which you know in as much as they're not even in the Bible they're not even  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3657" display="01:00:57" %}} - inspired and we just have plenty of um danger in going too far with this that doesn't mean that you will inherently  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3665" display="01:01:05" %}} - you know the second you look at one of these that I don't know that you're going to mess up your understanding the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3669" display="01:01:09" %}} - Trinity it's just we have to be really careful and one of the other reasons why we need to take such care is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3675" display="01:01:15" %}} - because of how critical and how important this Doctrine is generally for our faith and practice as Christians so  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3681" display="01:01:21" %}} - that's kind of where we're going to leave off here just all of this should help point us to you know okay so maybe  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3687" display="01:01:27" %}} - if some of these things aren't the best way for us to understand so we we've talked about three persons one Essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3694" display="01:01:34" %}} - well what does that mean how does that work in how God interacts with creation it's kind of where we're going to turn  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3699" display="01:01:39" %}} - next but this was just an introduction to the fact that we can use certain phenomena in the Physical Realm to try  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3707" display="01:01:47" %}} - to help us wrap our heads around how this works and things like that and it's not necessarily bad but we just really  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3713" display="01:01:53" %}} - need to be careful when when we do it so that we don't get tripped up a you have anything else you want to share before  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3720" display="01:02:00" %}} - we close out this section of the study not really I don't think there is uh much else to say it it does bear  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3729" display="01:02:09" %}} - repeating and emphasizing that um every every bit of the Bible is important and some parts of the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3738" display="01:02:18" %}} - are like you said foundational to our faith you don't need to understand the mechanics of the Trinity to be saved but  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3746" display="01:02:26" %}} - if you don't understand the Trinity and how it works there's a chance that you have a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3753" display="01:02:33" %}} - greater potential to have your faith threatened than if you did um because just as as  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3762" display="01:02:42" %}} - Stephen very aptly pointed out um the the the business of the Trinity the truth of the Trinity affirms The Who  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3772" display="01:02:52" %}} - part of what of of of the whole business of Jesus who is he and what did he do what did he do is what saved us but who  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3782" display="01:03:02" %}} - he is is what made what he did possible so if we if we don't get the who part then that's where we are weak that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3789" display="01:03:09" %}} - where Satan is going to attack and we we have seen it has been a potent attack in the history of the church visible for a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3797" display="01:03:17" %}} - long time so um getting it right is not an academic thing it's not a hobby we don't do it just for fun we do it in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3808" display="01:03:28" %}} - order to make sure that there are no gaps in our faith in our understanding of the Lord there are no chinks in our  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3815" display="01:03:35" %}} - armor that's why what what we do it for it's not just an academic [Music]  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3824" display="01:03:44" %}} - endeav so that's where we're going to cut this section in the study here I just briefly going to go back over uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3830" display="01:03:50" %}} - the things we've talked about here in discussing illustrations for the trinity we opened up talking about uh how you  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3837" display="01:03:57" %}} - know there are some perils there's some risks here especially if we're not careful in keeping these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3842" display="01:04:02" %}} - contextualized you know making it very clear that you know this isn't you know the formal teaching about God at best  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3849" display="01:04:09" %}} - these are just ways to help us better conceptualize him to put him in a human frame of reference so that maybe we can  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3857" display="01:04:17" %}} - wrap our heads about how three can be one and one can be three in terms of three persons one essence or one Essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3863" display="01:04:23" %}} - three persons um but we just have to be really careful when we do this that we don't get lost in translation um and so  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3870" display="01:04:30" %}} - then after that we talked about uh the Trinity triangle this illustration that has been around since the very early  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3876" display="01:04:36" %}} - church and how really calling this an illustration is is maybe not quite the same as some of the other ones because  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3882" display="01:04:42" %}} - it's just sort of a pictoral and image way to represent the doctrine of the Trinity which is that the father and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3888" display="01:04:48" %}} - son and the spirit are all God but the father is not the Son and the son is not the spirit and the spirit is is not the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3894" display="01:04:54" %}} - father right um and you can see those relationships represented here in the triangle and so um that uh early  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3901" display="01:05:01" %}} - illustration we said you know if you keep it to the picture you know there's nothing special about triangles for  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3906" display="01:05:06" %}} - example but you know it it can be helpful and just showing us in a visual representation of what the doctrine of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3913" display="01:05:13" %}} - the Trinity is then we talked about the illustration of the family of man the illustration of the human mind  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3920" display="01:05:20" %}} - illustrations from the world of nature like that example of the egg and illustrations from the Physical Realm  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3927" display="01:05:27" %}} - like light the the you know the electromagnetic radiation the Spectrum there with different wavelengths but  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3933" display="01:05:33" %}} - they're all light and space and time and matter and so on um all of these things can help kind of uh maybe help us get  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3942" display="01:05:42" %}} - some intuition for how can three things be one you know how can they all be the same yet different um in the same way  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3949" display="01:05:49" %}} - that um the three members of the Trinity are all God yet they are distinct persons that's kind kind of where these  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3955" display="01:05:55" %}} - analogies these illustrations are trying to help us go um but again we kind of closed out here just saying that because  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3960" display="01:06:00" %}} - of how important this Doctrine is because none of these illustrations are really in the Bible either we just have  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3966" display="01:06:06" %}} - to be careful that we don't take any of this too far that if we do any of this which um you know we're kind of going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3973" display="01:06:13" %}} - argue in the next part of the study that the best way to actually understand the Trinity is to look at how the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3979" display="01:06:19" %}} - operates in creation as uh recorded for us in the Bible That's the best way for us to understand how this works in  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3986" display="01:06:26" %}} - practice uh probably more than trying to uh reason with these illustrations or analogies so that's kind of where we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3993" display="01:06:33" %}} - going to be turning now we are going to be turning to the roles of the Trinity as discussed in the Bible so there's a a  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="3999" display="01:06:39" %}} - future section that's going to kind of hit more the Old Testament specifically we're talk about the concept of  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="4004" display="01:06:44" %}} - christophanies some but right now we're just going to be introducing the roles in the Trinity generally speaking so  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="4010" display="01:06:50" %}} - we're going to be talking about the father and the son and the spirit and uh names for God as it's involved in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="sPdsq-NwiDw" time="4016" display="01:06:56" %}} - roles in the Trinity so that's what the next lesson we'll be going over
