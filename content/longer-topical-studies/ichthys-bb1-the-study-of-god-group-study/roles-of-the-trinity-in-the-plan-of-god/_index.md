## Summary {#summary}

All three members of the Trinity are referred to by common names in both the Old and New Testaments: Elohim and YHVH (the so-called tetragrammaton) in the Hebrew Old testament, and Theos in the Greek New Testament. However, each member of the Trinity also has an individual name, based upon the role they play in God's overarching plan to redeem mankind: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Aside from going over the shared names, this lesson also examines the origin, significance, and person of each of these individual names.

### Roles of the Trinity in the Plan of God {#roles-of-the-trinity-in-the-plan-of-god}

A more valuable approach than the use of non-biblical illustrations to understand the nature of the Trinity is the examination of the function of the Trinity as described in the Bible. The scriptures have much to say about how God works in human history, and, specific to our topic, what roles the individual members of the Trinity play in that work, otherwise known as the "plan of God".

---

### General Introduction: The Roles of the Trinity Are a Biblical Way To Get Additional Perspective {#general-introduction-the-roles-of-the-trinity-are-a-biblical-way-to-get-additional-perspective}

God has not been operating in human history on an ad hoc or reactive basis, but has been "working everything together for good" (Rom.8:28) since the moment of creation. The Plan of God will be discussed as a topic in its own right in the [part 2B](https://ichthys.com/2B-Eschato.htm) of this series ([*Eschatology*](https://ichthys.com/2B-Eschato.htm)), but it will be helpful at this point to consider the unique roles played by the individual members of the Trinity in executing that plan in time, for by so doing, we shall gain *biblical* insight into the true nature of the Trinity.

No potentially-misleading illustrations necessary

### The Names of the Trinity: Shared Names {#the-names-of-the-trinity-shared-names}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-shared-names-elohim">Trinity > Shared names > *Elohim*</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-shared-names-yahweh">Trinity > Shared names > *Yahweh*</a>
{{< /subjects >}}
<!-- p="Zechariah 2:8-9; Hebrews 1:5-14" -->

Much can be understood about the Trinity through a consideration of the names by which they are revealed. Collectively, the Trinity refer to themselves as God. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for God, *'Elohim* (translated in the New Testament by the common Greek word for God, *theos*), is technically a plural of a word originally meaning "mighty one"; collectively then, the Trinity share this appellation, pluralized to express additional majesty.

Individually considered, however, members of the Trinity in the Old Testament are referred to most commonly by the Hebrew word *Yahweh* (translated in the New Testament by the common Greek word for Lord, *kyrios*), a word that, as we have seen, calls special attention to the Lord's timeless and dynamic being (see [section I, note 1](https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm#N_1_)). These two names, God and Lord, emphasize respectively the unity of the Trinity in its three-fold persons (*'Elohim* is plural but refers to the Trinity collectively), and the joint divine-essence of all three individual members (*Yahweh* is singular but can be used to refer to any of the Trinity's members individually).

With the fuller revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament following the revelation and advent of Jesus Christ (see [Part II C. for the Trinity in the Old Testament](https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm#C.%20The%20Trinity%20in%20the%20Old%20Testament)), the names Father, Son and Holy Spirit give us an even clearer understanding of the roles of the Trinity (and therefore of the Trinity itself).

Cf. the general concept of so-called *progressive revelation*. This is an excellent example of the phenomenon.

#### The Father (the 1st Person of the Trinity) {#the-father-the-1st-person-of-the-trinity}

{{< subjects >}}
<a href="/subject-index/#trinity-roles-father">Trinity > Roles > Father</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#fatherhood-of-god">Fatherhood of God</a>
<a href="/subject-index/#typology-human-copies-the-divine-not-the-other-way-around">Typology > Human copies the divine, not the other way around</a>
{{< /subjects >}}
<!-- p="Deuteronomy 32:6; Exodus 4:22; Hebrews 12:5-11; Exodus 3:14-15; Isaiah 46:9-10" -->

*Origin*: The term for and idea of the Fatherhood of God, a designation well known from the New Testament, is also found in the Old Testament from the Pentateuch onward. The word Father is first used for God in Deuteronomy 32:6: "Is He not your Father? The One who bought you? He is the One who made you and established you." Later in verse 18 of the same chapter, God is referred to as "the Rock who fathered you". The concept of the fatherhood of God can also be seen at Exodus 4:22, where Israel is referred to as God's "firstborn son".

---

*Significance*: The use of the name "Father" is clearly intended to be taken as an analogy from human experience. Like the father who sired us, He is our creator. Like a father, He is our authority figure, our trainer, disciplinarian, and teacher (Heb.12:5-11). And, not to be underestimated, He is the One who cares for us and loves us deeply, who protects us, keeps us safe, and wants only what is truly best for us (regardless of what we see as best).

Being human, our earthly fathers had strengths and weaknesses, and despite their best intentions had to act on the basis of imperfect information about what was best for us. But our heavenly Father represents the perfect ideal of fatherhood. He acts toward us always in perfect love, and all He does for us is without question for our ultimate good, for whether He disciplines us or blesses us, He does so in perfect knowledge of who we are, and of all that is in our hearts.

---

*Person*: The Father is often referred to as the 1st person of the Trinity (i.e., the authoritative "I" person), because He speaks to us as "I", directly manifesting His ***authoritative*** will as our God, creator and ruler of the universe (e.g., Ex.3:14-15; Is.46:9-10).

<!-- p="Job 38:7; Romans 8:14; Galatians 3:26; Galatians 4:5; John 1:12; 1 John 3:1-2; Luke 3:38; 1 Corinthians 15:45; Daniel 7:13-14; Isaiah 42:18ff; Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 52:13-53:12; Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:15; Psalm 2:7-12; Psalm 110:1; Matthew 21:33-40; John 15:14-15; John 14:6; Ephesians 2:18; Ephesians 3:12; Mark 10:35-45" -->

*Origin*: Along with the holy angels (Job 38:7 [not NIV]), we believers are all "sons" of God (Rom.8:14; Gal.3:26; 4:5; cf. Jn.1:12; 1Jn.3:1-2). This widespread franchise of sonship is based upon the paternal position of the Father relative to all His obedient creatures, but there is only one "*the* Son of God (our Lord, Jesus Christ)".

Though Christ's incarnation was, in a veiled fashion, prophesied and foreshadowed by ritual and sacrifice, it remained in Old Testament times very much a mystery until the time of His actual first advent. Now it stands clearly revealed that *the* archetypical Son of God is our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the Old Testament parallels are types that look forward to this revelation. For example:

- Adam is the son of God (Lk.3:38) -- Christ is *the* preeminent "last Adam" (1Cor.15:45; and cf. the "Son of Man [i.e., *'adam*]" of Dan.7:13-14 as well as New Testament usage)
- Israel is the servant of God (Is.42:18ff) -- Christ is *the* suffering Servant who takes away the sins of the world (Is.42:1; 52:13 - 53:12)
- Israel is God's son -- Christ is *the* Son (Hos.11:1 fulfilled at Matt.2:15)
- Finally, though Solomon was David's direct descendant, Christ is his ultimate descendant, the Messiah, *the* Son of David who is also the Son of God (Ps.2:7-12; 110:1).

---

*Significance*: Building on the idea of fatherhood as discussed above, sonship denotes the idea of a special and unbreakable relationship with the Father, one of dutiful subordination to the Father's will, but also one of special privilege, inheritance and shared authority.

A son (especially a king's son) is often more accessible than a father. The role of mediator between the king and His offending subjects can only be played by someone who is on a par with both the Father-king and creature-subjects: only a Son (incarnate) can be sent on such a mission of reconciliation (cf. Matt.21:33-40).

---

*Person*: The Son is often referred to as the 2nd person (i.e., the accessible "you" person), because He is ***accessible*** to us, having appeared in the flesh to forge a relationship with us on the Father's behalf (e.g., Jn.15:14-15), and having gained access to the Father for us (Jn.14:6; Eph.2:18; 3:12).

<!-- p="Genesis 1:2; Revelation 22:17; John 3:8; Zechariah 4:6; 1 Corinthians 12:3; Genesis 6:3; 1 Corinthians 12:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:5-8; John 14:16-17; Galatians 5:22-26" -->

*Origin*: From the first chapter of the Old Testament (Gen.1:2), to the closing chapter of the New Testament (Rev.22:17), the word "spirit" is used to refer to God the Holy Spirit. The Hebrew and Greek words for "spirit", *ruach* and *pneuma* respectively, have the core meaning of "wind" or "breeze", and, again, there are important points to be garnered from the name analogy.

---

*Significance*: The wind is a potent, invisible force. Though we perceive it and experience its effects, we can neither see where it has come from or where it is going to (Jn.3:8). It can have everything from a gentle, warming influence to a powerful, chilling effect. "Wind" is thus an aptly descriptive analogy for the Holy Spirit's role in the plan of God: His invisible yet powerful support of good (Zech.4:6; 1Cor.12:3) and restraint of evil (Gen.6:3; 1Cor.12:3; 2Thes.2:5-8) in the furtherance of the plan of God must not be underestimated.

---

*Person*: The Holy Spirit is often referred to as the 3rd person of the Trinity (i.e., the unseen "he" person), because unlike the Father, He does not speak directly to us, and unlike the Son, He has not been made manifest to us; instead, like the wind, He is ***unseen*** by us, but, like the wind, that does not mean that we do not experience His power in a very personal and dynamic way (Jn.14:16-17; Gal.5:22-26).

<!-- p="John 3:5; John 14:16-17; John 14:26; John 15:26; John 16:8-15; Acts 5:3, Acts 5:9; Acts 13:2; Acts 16:6-10; Romans 8:26; 1 Corinthians 2:10; Revelation 2:7; John 14:16; John 16:7; Romans 8:4; Galatians 5:16; Galatians 5:18; John 16:7; 2 Corinthians 1:3-7; Luke 24:49; Romans 15:13" -->

As should be clear from the discussion above, the names Father, Son, and Spirit are thus representative of the Trinity's individual roles in the plan of God for mankind, and have been given to help us understand the relationships and functions of the three divine personalities in that plan.

The names themselves must not be pushed beyond the clearly intended analogies to our human frame of reference as outlined above. This is no small caveat, for it is largely on the basis of the title "Son" that heresies of the past have sought to deny the full and equal divinity of Christ (e.g., casting Him as subordinate in essence to the Father as hyper-Arianism does). 

The case of the Spirit also shows how wrong-headed such analyses based solely on these titles are, for the Spirit is not at all "inanimate" or "impersonal" even though "wind" is a fitting description of His invisible yet powerful role in our Christian lives. He acts in a very personal way towards us and towards the other members of the Trinity (Jn.3:5; 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26; 16:8-15; Acts 5:3, 5:9; 13:2; 16:6-10; Rom.8:26; 1Cor.2:10; Rev.2:7), and as our Comforter-Encourager (Jn.14:16; 16:7). The relationship of leadership (Rom.8:4; Gal.5:16 & 18), encouragement (cf. Jn.14:16; 16:7; 2Cor.1:3-7) and empowerment (Lk.24:49; Rom.15:13) we receive from the Holy Spirit are some of the most "personal" and "animating" relationships we shall ever experience this side of heaven.

{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - so the next section of this study in Bible basics part one theology that we are going to be looking at are the roles  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7" display="00:07" %}} - in the trinity in the plan of God and so by in the plan of God we kind of mean in creation right in this Cosmos um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="15" display="00:15" %}} - this also counts sort of throughout all of creation so um you know this isn't specifically the focus of the study of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="22" display="00:22" %}} - theology proper there are other studies on ichus part 2B talks about eschatology in particular um but how God interacts  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="31" display="00:31" %}} - with human history helps us see how the members of the Trinity have adopted roles and so roles are sort of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="38" display="00:38" %}} - properly speaking a property of creation um you know that is how the Bible describes them to us whether they exist  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="44" display="00:44" %}} - external to that we're just not even going to go there because how the Bible discusses it is what the father and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="50" display="00:50" %}} - son and the spirit do uh for example in bringing about salvation in working in the world um and so we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="57" display="00:57" %}} - focusing on how the Bible talks about the father and the son and the spirit um as you know the roles in the Trinity so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="64" display="01:04" %}} - we're going to introduce just the idea generally of the roles of the trinity in the plan of God uh we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="70" display="01:10" %}} - talking about how uh the roles in the Trinity are a Biblical way to get additional perspective on the persons in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="76" display="01:16" %}} - the Trinity right as kind of contrasted with some of the illustrations we just went through um the benefit we have here  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="82" display="01:22" %}} - is that the roles are most certainly taught in the Bible now these are analogies too to be clear right actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="88" display="01:28" %}} - a lot of heresy in the past has gotten real stuck on the sun part of the Trinity as in you know a a being that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="95" display="01:35" %}} - was begotten sort of those sorts of problems um and they stumble there because this is an analogy it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="103" display="01:43" %}} - supposed to be literal um and so you know it's sort of same caveats that we had before about you know illustrations  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="110" display="01:50" %}} - for illustrations the advantage that these have is that at least these are biblical at least we're getting these  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="115" display="01:55" %}} - titles these names these analogies from scripture rather than I don't know just coming up with them um so we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="122" display="02:02" %}} - talk about just generally how this is a Biblical way to get more perspective on the members of the Trinity we're going  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="129" display="02:09" %}} - to be talking about names next so um there's uh a name Elohim you probably heard that word before um you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="137" display="02:17" %}} - plural of majesty Mighty ones you know this is basically the title for God in the Old Testament and then the Greek  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="144" display="02:24" %}} - word is Theos um probably heard that too that's God you know that means god you know those Theo plurals like Gods is in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="153" display="02:33" %}} - like the gods of the Greek pantheon but Theos is God proper in the New Testament and then we also have the personal name  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="160" display="02:40" %}} - of God the tetr grammaton which means four letters in Greek um that is sort of the Holy title of God this is who God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="168" display="02:48" %}} - says he is in Exodus chapter 3 this is I am who I am says the Lord right this is the you'll see this kind of printed in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="176" display="02:56" %}} - small caps the tetragramaton um and you'll see it liter commonly as Yahweh um or Jehovah um depending on who you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="184" display="03:04" %}} - ask um but that is you know the personal title for God and interestingly that's singular so we said Elohim is plural you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="192" display="03:12" %}} - know what I I won't go too much into this because we'll get there when we get there in the slide but all of this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="196" display="03:16" %}} - talking about those are names for the Trinity specifically and then we're going to get into the individual names  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="201" display="03:21" %}} - within the Trinity um for the father and the son and the spirit um and those names correspond to the roles within the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="208" display="03:28" %}} - Trinity so the father is the first person of the Trinity the son is the second person and the Holy Spirit is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="213" display="03:33" %}} - third person kind of actually descriptive in the same way we have first person second person and third  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="218" display="03:38" %}} - person in verbs like as in I versus you versus he she or it um and after all of that uh kind of just how we had that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="227" display="03:47" %}} - cautionary note at the end of our last uh section talking about illustrations we're going to have similar cautionary  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="234" display="03:54" %}} - note here talking about how analogies are just analogies right um so the fact that we're talking about a father and a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="240" display="04:00" %}} - son does not actually mean that the father like sired the son in the way that we do as human you know Bloodlines  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="247" display="04:07" %}} - and whatnot um and very important to emphasize that because the analogies are just analogies um so we'll beat that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="255" display="04:15" %}} - horse when we get to the last slide there but this is generally speaking what we're going to be talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="260" display="04:20" %}} - here going over uh roles of the trinity in the plan of God all right so roles in the trinity in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="271" display="04:31" %}} - the plan of God kind of the overarching thing we're going to be talking about here is the use here of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="279" display="04:39" %}} - construction of examining the roles kind of as contrasted with non-biblical illustrations to help us understand the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="285" display="04:45" %}} - nature of the Trinity um you know as it's described in the Bible like actually described in the Bible versus  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="291" display="04:51" %}} - just things that we came up with so the scriptures have much to say about how God works in human history and specific  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="296" display="04:56" %}} - to our topic what roles the individual members of the Trinity play in that work otherwise known as the plan of God so um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="304" display="05:04" %}} - I think earlier in this especially in talking about the Trinity we've kind of touched on this before about how all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="311" display="05:11" %}} - three members of the Trinity were involved in creation for example all three members of the Trinity were  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="317" display="05:17" %}} - involved in uh redemption in the Jesus Christ paying for our sins you know we might think of Jesus Christ more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="324" display="05:24" %}} - specifically but the spirit is the one who enabled it the father is the one who accepted the sacrifice on our behalf  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="329" display="05:29" %}} - things like that all three members of the Trinity are integrally part of the working out of the plan of God in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="337" display="05:37" %}} - creation so that's kind of the opening topic you know not a lot to it a you have anything you want to say um so the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="345" display="05:45" %}} - the concern of um the Christian walk is uh entirely about the plan of God uh that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="355" display="05:55" %}} - really all we are involved in um God is an objective that he's looking to accomplish and there is a plan a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="363" display="06:03" %}} - sequence so to speak of steps that will be taken to get there so this is yet another reason that um understanding the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="372" display="06:12" %}} - Trinity is so important to us because it is an integral part of the business of spiritual growth because you'll come to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="381" display="06:21" %}} - see how the plan is unfolding um through the the various roles that the Trinity plays so um yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="394" display="06:34" %}} - the the roles of the Trinity are in the plan of God are a critical thing for us to understand and like you said uh this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="402" display="06:42" %}} - is also where we come to see that analogies and illustrations will break down we won't see that the father is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="408" display="06:48" %}} - father because he somehow generated the son at some point and that the spirit somehow was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="416" display="06:56" %}} - generated either by the father or by the father and the son it it it it is it is um it is very  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="426" display="07:06" %}} - educative very telling to see that when we look at the Creeds of the past whether the nyine or the apostolic we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="434" display="07:14" %}} - can see what happens when we miss the forest for the trees and when people focused so much on fighting the fight  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="445" display="07:25" %}} - for the Trinity that they couldn't actually tell what they were looking look at and started talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="452" display="07:32" %}} - eternal generation and proceeding from the father in all sorts of oblique ways so um for us for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="462" display="07:42" %}} - the the um the interesting thing about the Trinity is really in the fact that in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="470" display="07:50" %}} - the unfolding plan of God the Father plays a specific role to realize that family that he had he wants in the end  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="479" display="07:59" %}} - the son also plays a specific role towards it and so does the spirit and each of these roles is actually what  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="487" display="08:07" %}} - they were named for which is why it is absurd in the extreme for someone to say for example God is spirit and therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="498" display="08:18" %}} - the holy spirit is the is the spirit of the father who is kind of like the H the body the spirit is the animating force  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="507" display="08:27" %}} - of the father very crazy sorts of things that people come up with which is why they can also talk about the generation  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="513" display="08:33" %}} - of the son because he's called the son now I will say that kind of what we're saying here and this is important I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="520" display="08:40" %}} - don't want us to get too off in the weeds but they will tend to call these things as hypostatic properties that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="525" display="08:45" %}} - the really jargony theological way that people who argue about these things will say that the father you know in what AUD  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="533" display="08:53" %}} - and I are saying and this is the correct way to look at it the father is called the father not because he was this way  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="540" display="09:00" %}} - and then we applied the label but because of the role that the father acts in creation that's why he's called the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="545" display="09:05" %}} - father right um and the difference is between the roles in the Trinity it's about what they do not you know so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="555" display="09:15" %}} - because you know like people I'm sorry I'm not being very elegant here I have had conversations with people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="560" display="09:20" %}} - Orthodox or Catholic who have different ideas about this shall we say and one of the characteristics of what they talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="567" display="09:27" %}} - about is that the father is such and such way or the sun is such and such way right that this is why they they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="576" display="09:36" %}} - like that and I'm saying no no no the members of the Trinity have adopted the roles in how they deal with us as humans  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="583" display="09:43" %}} - in creation those are different things um and so the names like you said follow the rules right that's the order here  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="590" display="09:50" %}} - the names follow the rules so um but they are descriptive of how the members of the Trinity operate within the plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="596" display="09:56" %}} - of God Sor sorry to jump in but yeah that's that's fine the names are not ontologically what they are that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="604" display="10:04" %}} - point they are simply descriptive of the roles that they play so this is why the roles of the Trinity and the plan of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="613" display="10:13" %}} - is a very apt title for us who have chosen to grow spiritually and to um uh get to spiritual maturity and to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="623" display="10:23" %}} - productive for the Lord in the ways he wants us to be productive the most important thing is for us to understand  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="630" display="10:30" %}} - what the plan of God is what God is looking to accomplish and how he is setting out to accomplish it so that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="635" display="10:35" %}} - can see where we have any space to fit in and make our own contribution that is why when we talk about the Trinity as we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="645" display="10:45" %}} - said before it's not an academic thing it's not something we just theologize about and we can talk with big heads  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="652" display="10:52" %}} - like we have a lot of education and we can use the jargons involved we are learning something that's viscerally  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="660" display="11:00" %}} - important to our lives it matters in the decisions we make from day to day so that is why the roles of the trinity in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="669" display="11:09" %}} - the plan of God is a thing that matters to us it also explains to us why one member of the Trinity is called the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="677" display="11:17" %}} - father another is called the son another is called the spirit and we don't get lost like those who do and names  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="685" display="11:25" %}} - themselves without actually understanding the point of the names that's I mean and it's it's quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="692" display="11:32" %}} - Central to properly understanding the shall we say God's interaction with creation if you don't understand the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="702" display="11:42" %}} - roles you don't understand how the different members of the Trinity relate it's just easier to get confused  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="709" display="11:49" %}} - generally speaking about say God's attitude towards Humanity because how the father interacts with creation and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="716" display="11:56" %}} - how the son interacts with creation they have chose CH to adopt these these different roles right now if we say that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="724" display="12:04" %}} - God's attitude towards humanity is shown in the son that's true God's attitude towards humanity is shown in the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="731" display="12:11" %}} - that's true but you see how people who who don't properly understand the idea of roles will suddenly get all lost and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="739" display="12:19" %}} - confused because how the Son and the father relate to humanity aren't the same um and neither one of them is any  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="746" display="12:26" %}} - less true right this is where the rubber hits the road about like maybe it sounds so simple right but people really get  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="755" display="12:35" %}} - lost in this and this is why it's important for us to cover the roles what it means and how God can have this Unity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="761" display="12:41" %}} - of purpose even as they each do their adop their roles um in terms of how they interact with creation right they can  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="770" display="12:50" %}} - have complete Unity of Will and yet not be doing exactly the same things right and right about here is where again we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="776" display="12:56" %}} - say our human ability to comprehend this just does not work very well because you know so for example in human Endeavors  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="783" display="13:03" %}} - people who are you know doing if they're like on the same page doing the same things that's how we tend to think about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="790" display="13:10" %}} - it right um people who have Unity of will are basically doing everything identically God the members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="798" display="13:18" %}} - Trinity are doing not identical things they have adopted these roles yet they have perfect Unity of will how does that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="804" display="13:24" %}} - work that is the Trinity right um yeah so um all right well we will get into more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="812" display="13:32" %}} - of all of this but this is the general introduction here that the roles of the Trinity as adopted in the plan of God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="818" display="13:38" %}} - the overarching topic that we are setting out to discuss here in this section of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="827" display="13:47" %}} - lesson all right so uh the next thing that we're going to be talking about here uh in discussing the roles of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="834" display="13:54" %}} - trinity in the plan of God is we're just going to be kind of doing this uh taking a step back again to understand why  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="842" display="14:02" %}} - we're talking about the roles kind of how it relates contrasting it with some of the illustrations we've just talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="848" display="14:08" %}} - about so uh when we talk about God and his plan for human history one of the ways in which God's planning is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="855" display="14:15" %}} - fundamentally different than ours as humans is he has perfect omniscience and perfect forward knowledge and so God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="860" display="14:20" %}} - does not react to history he doesn't react to events on an ad hoc or reactive basis he is not merely some big creature  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="869" display="14:29" %}} - is the Creator and sustainer of the universe that makes him fundamentally different and since the beginning of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="875" display="14:35" %}} - world even since before the very first Act of Creation God has been working everything together for good it's what  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="882" display="14:42" %}} - Romans 8:28 tells us um the plan of God is kind of not the focus of the current study where we're going through theology  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="889" display="14:49" %}} - proper it's a topic in its own right um some of it's covered in part 2B of this Bible basic series um 2A talks about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="897" display="14:57" %}} - angels angelology part two is talking about eschatology um you know specifically the culmination of the plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="904" display="15:04" %}} - of God um but nonetheless we're going to be considering how these unique roles played by the individual members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="911" display="15:11" %}} - Trinity kind of are involved in executing the plan of God in time because when we do this we are going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="918" display="15:18" %}} - be gaining biblical insight into the true nature of the Trinity so this isn't terribly different than what we said uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="924" display="15:24" %}} - just before um again we're just emphasizing the point that what we're talking about is actually in the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="930" display="15:30" %}} - that makes it different than some of the illustrations that people have had where it's not so much focused on you know the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="937" display="15:37" %}} - words of scripture as people just coming up with ways to try to think about it well this approach of trying to analyze  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="944" display="15:44" %}} - the roles of the Trinity uh as they contribute to the plan of God is actually coming straight out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="950" display="15:50" %}} - scripture so anything more to say there before we actually jump into talking about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="956" display="15:56" %}} - rather than just talking about talking about it I guess we we we we we'd best just jump  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="963" display="16:03" %}} - into it all right good deal all right so uh having gone through the last couple slides of introduction  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="974" display="16:14" %}} - here now we're going to start talking about the roles in the Trinity but even before we get there to the individual  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="980" display="16:20" %}} - roles of father son and spirit we're going to be talking about names for the Trinity generally and specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="986" display="16:26" %}} - shared names here so much can be understood about the Trinity just by considering um the names through which  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="994" display="16:34" %}} - we are told you know like how God is described and named in the Bible so collectively the Trinity refer to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1001" display="16:41" %}} - themselves as God you know this is one of the fundamental parts of you know the doctrine of the Trinity they are all God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1007" display="16:47" %}} - they are one in essence they all have the essence of divinity the essence of God um in the Old Testament the Hebrew  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1013" display="16:53" %}} - word for God is Elohim and you'll see this translated in the New Testament by the common Greek word for God fos like  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1021" display="17:01" %}} - I've said this can be used in a plural form for you know like the Greek gods of the pantheon they didn't make a new word  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1028" display="17:08" %}} - for God they just use that word but understand it with a definite article it is the god of you know Israel rather  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1036" display="17:16" %}} - than Zeus for example um and so this word Elohim Theos in Greek um Elohim in Hebrew is actually a plural word you can  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1045" display="17:25" %}} - see that by the E ending if you've ever studied Hebrew um so this is technically a plural of a word originally meaning  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1052" display="17:32" %}} - mighty one um so collectively then the Trinity share this appalation and you'll see this in scholarship often called a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1060" display="17:40" %}} - plural of majesty um so Elohim is plural and of course we see this with the context of the New Testament as being an  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1069" display="17:49" %}} - oblique reference to the Trinity but also you know plural as a form of majesty um now individually considered  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1078" display="17:58" %}} - not considering you know the Trinity as a whole but individually members of the trinity in the Old Testament are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1083" display="18:03" %}} - referred to most commonly by the Hebrew word Yahweh so again this is the tetragramaton um and you'll see this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1093" display="18:13" %}} - transliterated in the New Testament uh by the common Greek word for Lord which is Kudos um and this is a word that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1100" display="18:20" %}} - calls special attention to the Lord's Timeless and dynamic being so there's a footnote in the study not going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1105" display="18:25" %}} - actually go click on that but um the the root I mean Scholars debate it is relating to the the basically being the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1113" display="18:33" %}} - idea is existence is tied up in the very name of God and so these two names God and Lord emphasize respectively the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1121" display="18:41" %}} - unity of the trinity in its three-fold persons that's the Elohim being plural but refers to the Trinity collectively  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1128" display="18:48" %}} - as well as the joint Divine Essence you know Essence again actually coming from the Latin verb to be you know essay um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1137" display="18:57" %}} - The Joint Divine Essence of all three members comes from uh the tetr Graton Yahweh right that Hebrew  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1144" display="19:04" %}} - word um the the the four letters there that get us this idea of God being existence he is The Great I Am um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1153" display="19:13" %}} - Yahweh is singular but can be used to refer to any of the Trinity's members individually so this is talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1160" display="19:20" %}} - the Trinity writ large you know this is you know not the specific roles that each of the members adopt but this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1166" display="19:26" %}} - applies to all of the members um and so this is very much talking about the shared attributes of the Trinity so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1173" display="19:33" %}} - three persons one Essence right all of them are God Elohim all of them you know have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1181" display="19:41" %}} - essence of divinity so each one of them individually can be called by the tetragramaton you know that we might  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1187" display="19:47" %}} - transliterate is Yahweh all of them are wrapped up in that Eternal existence that you know I am who I am that applies  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1195" display="19:55" %}} - to each member of the Trinity you have anything to add here um yeah um I'm going to raise uh two  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1205" display="20:05" %}} - passages let me make sure I haven't forgotten the second one again um the first one is in Zechariah 2 I've  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1213" display="20:13" %}} - mentioned it before in these conversations as well the second one is uh Hebrews chapter 2 Hebrews chapter 1  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1226" display="20:26" %}} - and I believe it was quoting probably um a Psalm it was it was quoting a Psalm but I don't remember the psalm so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1235" display="20:35" %}} - Hebrews 2 one will do so in Zechariah 2 I I think it might have been verse 9 or verse 8  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1244" display="20:44" %}} - um yes it's uh verse 8 for thus says the Lord of hosts he has he sent  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1256" display="20:56" %}} - me after Glory glory to the Nations which plunder you this is um nkjv for He Who touches you touches the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1266" display="21:06" %}} - apple of his eye for surely I will shake my hand against them and they shall become spoiled for their servants then  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1274" display="21:14" %}} - you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me the speaker is the Lord of hosts the sender is the Lord of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1282" display="21:22" %}} - hosts um then in Hebrews uh I believe it's Hebrews chapter 1 like I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1291" display="21:31" %}} - said not two Hebrews chapter 1 it says there as well the speaker  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1299" display="21:39" %}} - here let's let's begin from verse five I'm not going to read the whole thing I just want to to point  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1309" display="21:49" %}} - out who the speaker here is and I I believe we can start from verse one God who at various times and in various ways  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1315" display="21:55" %}} - spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets then this is still the subject the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1322" display="22:02" %}} - subject of the long run on sentence that follows in verse 5 it says for to which of the Angels did he this same God ever  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1331" display="22:11" %}} - say such and such and in verse 8 it says but to the son this God says your throne oh God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1343" display="22:23" %}} - forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is a scepter of your kingdom you you have loved righteousness  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1349" display="22:29" %}} - and hated lawlessness therefore God your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1358" display="22:38" %}} - in verse 10 this is a very interesting one you Lord this is still God the one we call the father speaking to the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1369" display="22:49" %}} - you Lord in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of your  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1375" display="22:55" %}} - hands they will perish but you remain and they will all grow old like a garments like a cloak you will fold them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - up and they will be changed but you are the same and your ears will not fail now these are words that you would expect  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1393" display="23:13" %}} - someone who is Raising praise to the Lord who is worshiping God would say in other words this is the proper way to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1401" display="23:21" %}} - address God recognizing his place relative to creation and this is the father speaking to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1412" display="23:32" %}} - son that in itself I think is pretty conclusive about the the fact  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1424" display="23:44" %}} - that these are equals the son speaks this way to the father there should be no question about it all we have to do  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1431" display="23:51" %}} - is just read the gospels all the prayers that Jesus made all the things he said about the father they are all they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1438" display="23:58" %}} - similar what Jesus said about the father we are seeing the father say about Jesus so that is to tell us we're not talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1447" display="24:07" %}} - about people who have any sort of hierarchy between them if we if we would say that for any reason there is we we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1456" display="24:16" %}} - can say that there is um subservience there is uh there is a sort of a bringing down of the son relative  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1466" display="24:26" %}} - to the father now what do we say when we see this passage we know that the passage that we read in Zechariah 2 was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1477" display="24:37" %}} - the son speaking we should know that it should be obvious to us because of the role that Jesus played he was the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1483" display="24:43" %}} - who was sent by the father to die for our sins the Bible says just as much and what was being said in Zechariah 2 was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1492" display="24:52" %}} - about the Redemption of Israel which we know from the scriptures is going to be accomplished by the son and yet the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1499" display="24:59" %}} - speaker was the Lord of hosts in other translations you'll get you will see the Lord God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1505" display="25:05" %}} - and the person who is sending the speaker is also the Lord of hosts or as in other translations the Lord God so we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1516" display="25:16" %}} - might want to get U try to make sense of how this sort of thing is working out but before we get making sense of how it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1527" display="25:27" %}} - is working working out it it really is sufficient in itself to say these two are the Lord God these two are God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1537" display="25:37" %}} - these two address each other with all the respect that is due to God that is very significant in itself it should  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1545" display="25:45" %}} - tell us that then when we apply father as title to one and Son as title to another which is what the Bible says yes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1555" display="25:55" %}} - we can recognize that because of these titles one is taking a place of authority and another is taking the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1563" display="26:03" %}} - place of a servant fact if I have a son in my house right now what I have is a daughter if I have a son I expect him to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1572" display="26:12" %}} - listen to me and do what I say so it makes sense to think of these titles as speaking to their relative authority to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1582" display="26:22" %}} - each other but we should also not miss the point that when the scriptures address these people in their  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1590" display="26:30" %}} - deity it's almost as if the titles don't mean anything they do we should not this the important thing is to hold one on  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1599" display="26:39" %}} - the on on the one hand and hold the other on the other hand recognizing that both things are true at the same time  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1606" display="26:46" %}} - that is pretty much what we are talking about here now to pull us back to the names real quick shows up  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1615" display="26:55" %}} - great example here in the Hebrews passage to the son father speaking he says your throne oh God I am guessing  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1621" display="27:01" %}} - this is vocative but you know that's a particular case in Greek but I am guessing this this word right here  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1626" display="27:06" %}} - that's Theos right God yeah and down here verse 10 Lord this is kuros It's both words we just said right this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1636" display="27:16" %}} - the father speaking to the son calls him God and calls him Lord right and yeah you know like the son is God and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1645" display="27:25" %}} - father is God and the spirit is God but they all go by you know Lord you know like we see God Almighty Lord of hosts  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1653" display="27:33" %}} - here in Zechariah right um yeah we are talking about these names right here these are shared names of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1662" display="27:42" %}} - right um so you know these are great you know passages referencing some of what we're talking about um also as we get  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1671" display="27:51" %}} - more into the roles of the father and the son we we'll talk a bit more about you know the the way in which they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1678" display="27:58" %}} - relate to each other you know AI has gotten into some of this but the point is and um as this ties back to what  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1685" display="28:05" %}} - we're talking about you see that both the father and the son or God both the father and the son have all of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1695" display="28:15" %}} - aspects of the Divine Essence that we talked about previously you know when we were talking about the nature and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1700" display="28:20" %}} - essence of God we we said all of these things all these essential so-called essential characteristics of God apply  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1705" display="28:25" %}} - to both the father and the son because they're both God they both share the same Essence um how can you have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1714" display="28:34" %}} - inferiority or disparity in status that was one of the things we talked about there can be no inferiority or disparity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1721" display="28:41" %}} - in status because they share the same essence you know they share the same qualities of divinity um so that's why I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1731" display="28:51" %}} - talking about the names are important specifically the fact that these are shared names in the Trinity um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1744" display="29:04" %}} - yes so now that we've talked some about the shared names of the Trinity here so we talked about Elohim translated as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1751" display="29:11" %}} - Theos in the Greek and Yahweh tetr Graton translated is curios in the Greek well now we're going to be talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1761" display="29:21" %}} - the individual names for the roles in the Trinity here and so asec this puts it with the Fuller revelation of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1768" display="29:28" %}} - Trinity in the New Testament following the Revelation and the Advent of Jesus Christ um so for the Old Testament we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1774" display="29:34" %}} - actually going to be talking about the trinity in the Old Testament separately um but in the New Testament the names  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1780" display="29:40" %}} - Father Son and Holy Spirit um and and these apply to individual members of the Trinity rather than all three of them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1786" display="29:46" %}} - together well these names these roles give us an even clearer understanding of the roles of the Trinity and therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1793" display="29:53" %}} - the Trinity itself how can we have three members who are not the same person yet have unified will well they work out the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1801" display="30:01" %}} - same purpose again why we've been emphasizing the plan of God they have the same unified purpose yet they do  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1808" display="30:08" %}} - different things um so I I added this note this is actually not part of the study here I said that this is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1815" display="30:15" %}} - excellent example of so-called progressive revelation that is it's not like God was ever not composed of three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1823" display="30:23" %}} - persons one Essence right this has always been God's nature God has always been a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1828" display="30:28" %}} - however how clearly he revealed that to mankind has not been the same across all of human history you know especially  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1836" display="30:36" %}} - with the revealing of Jesus Christ um that is very strong language I think honestly we ought to use that sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1842" display="30:42" %}} - language more often uh the revealing of Jesus Christ was a Divine mystery um with the Advent of Jesus Christ suddenly  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1851" display="30:51" %}} - all of these things that the Old Testament Believers only had in Shadows or prophecy or you know like maybe they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1857" display="30:57" %}} - were they were kind of guessing at now we have all of that as history as things that we know and believe have happened  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1865" display="31:05" %}} - it's different hence progressive revelation right um and this is you know this is no strange teaching that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1872" display="31:12" %}} - getting at here again theologians love to put ter like to to attach labels to things but all we're talking about is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1878" display="31:18" %}} - the fact that God's truth um you know now it's it's more sealed because we have the complete Canon of scripture but  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1886" display="31:26" %}} - throughout the working out of the Plan of Redemption you know culminating in the cross in the ministry of Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1891" display="31:31" %}} - Christ what God had revealed to even Believers you know even people like Abraham and David they didn't have the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1898" display="31:38" %}} - full picture and it was revealed progressively over time um and what we're going to be talking about with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1905" display="31:45" %}} - father and the son and the spirit you know there is no contradiction in what I'm saying that just because some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1912" display="31:52" %}} - Believers in the Old Testament didn't have as clear a view of this doesn't mean that the MERS of the Trinity like  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1919" display="31:59" %}} - only in the New Testament adopted the roles of father son and spirit you see what I'm saying um like that would be a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1926" display="32:06" %}} - different thing um so those those rules those roles have always existed even though the knowledge  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1935" display="32:15" %}} - of them and the understanding of them has only been Progressive we haven't always known about them in in human  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1943" display="32:23" %}} - history just like you said but they have always been there yep I mean it's also a lot of the discoveries that have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1949" display="32:29" %}} - made in science right we don't say that just because Newton um started talking about gravity gravity only started to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1958" display="32:38" %}} - exist at that time right you know yeah well I gu say this is not a it's not a controversial concept here it is just  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1969" display="32:49" %}} - it's important for us to understand that this is the nature and this by the way this isn't only dealing with this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1975" display="32:55" %}} - particular Doctrine in the Bible Progressive Revelations and important topic when it comes to understanding um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1982" display="33:02" %}} - how God has revealed all truth to us you know not just I mean Jesus Christ like I said the revelation of Jesus Christ we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1988" display="33:08" %}} - ought to speak about that more because of how big a mystery it was to the people of the Old Testament right  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="1993" display="33:13" %}} - stumbling over the suffering servant because they wanted the Conquering king um the mystery of Jesus Christ was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2001" display="33:21" %}} - very big deal um but the Trinity is another one of those things where we are blessed to have the ability to read more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2010" display="33:30" %}} - specifics about how this works with uh God's nature and how how do the members of the Trinity interact with uh the plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2019" display="33:39" %}} - of God for human history and creation and all of this that's just information that some Believers in the past didn't  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2025" display="33:45" %}} - have any access to and we're blessed to have the words of the Bible that mind you it takes a lot of of elbow grease  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2033" display="33:53" %}} - and hard work to you know read and understand and apply and things like that but we have the ability to do that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2040" display="34:00" %}} - because God has revealed more truth in that Progressive Way yeah yeah yeah very true very  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2050" display="34:10" %}} - true um all right so with that we will pick up next talking about each of the individual roles so the father and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2059" display="34:19" %}} - son and the spirit and um each one of those not we're going to get into it we're going to be talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2065" display="34:25" %}} - origin and the significance and the person that's how we're going to be breaking down all of that but what we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2073" display="34:33" %}} - done here is introduce the topic here of these individual names right these these things that kind of were not always so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2079" display="34:39" %}} - apparent but have always been there even if humans didn't have title for it like Audie said gravity existed even before  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2087" display="34:47" %}} - Newton started talking about it in the same way the Trinity has always existed in this form even if we didn't see as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2094" display="34:54" %}} - clearly because God had not yet revealed the fullness of his truth so that's where we're going to uh kind of preface  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2103" display="35:03" %}} - all of our next discussion here of these kind of just by talking about the fact that these roles have always been there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2109" display="35:09" %}} - right the things that we're talking about have been there from the beginning in the Bible um although much of what  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2114" display="35:14" %}} - we're going to talk about is going to be pulling primarily from the New Testament right that's where we have the more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2119" display="35:19" %}} - specific Revelation so now we are going to be talking about the names for the three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2129" display="35:29" %}} - roles in the Trinity going through each one uh kind of in depth here and for each of these roles we are going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2137" display="35:37" %}} - talking sort of about the origin of the name so where it comes from the significance of the name uh so sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2144" display="35:44" %}} - what it means in terms of how we view it and then uh the person of the Trinity corresponding to the name right how it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2152" display="35:52" %}} - uh kind of affects how we think of that member of the Trinity um so we're going to be talking about uh these three sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2158" display="35:58" %}} - of as a pattern as we go through the three roles three members of the Trinity we're going to be going over the origin  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2164" display="36:04" %}} - the significance and the person for the father first that's what we're doing here and then we're going to do the same  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2170" display="36:10" %}} - thing for the Son and the same thing for the spirit and so um as we start out talking about the origin of the name  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2179" display="36:19" %}} - father or the thinking of the role in terms of fatherhood so the term for and the idea of the fatherhood of god um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2188" display="36:28" %}} - this person this member of the Trinity the father in as much as God functions as a father figure for us um this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2197" display="36:37" %}} - obviously all over the place in the New Testament um but it's actually found in the Old Testament as well and so this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2203" display="36:43" %}} - idea of the fatherhood of God has been there since the beginning in the pentat the first five books of the Bible onward  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2210" display="36:50" %}} - um so the word father in the Hebrew Old Testament is first used in Deuteronomy chapter 32 um so Deuteronomy 32 verse  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2217" display="36:57" %}} - six says do you thus repay the Lord oh foolish and unwise people is not he your father who has bought you he has made  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2226" display="37:06" %}} - you and established you um and then in the next verse there so that was um 32 ver6 later in verse 18 in that same  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2234" display="37:14" %}} - chapter God is referred to as the rock who fathered you um so the concept of the fatherhood of God um you can also  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2242" display="37:22" %}} - see it here in um Exodus um so uh in Exodus chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2249" display="37:29" %}} - 4:22 um we have this idea of God As the father I mean we don't see the the word father directly there but it's by  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2255" display="37:35" %}} - implication um so Exodus 4:22 says then you shall say to Pharaoh thus says the Lord Israel is my son my firstborn so if  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2266" display="37:46" %}} - Israel is his son that makes him the father right um um in the metaphor here and so um Israel is referred to as God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2274" display="37:54" %}} - firstborn son and in invoking uh this idea of fatherhood um in fact uh we should be careful to note  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2283" display="38:03" %}} - that human fathers they get their um their idea of authority and uh uh you know when they run their households and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2294" display="38:14" %}} - they are the one who makes decisions and has um sort of the capacity to choose and yet the responsibility falls upon  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2303" display="38:23" %}} - them all of that is modeled off of God the Father not the other way around right um so it's not like God the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2310" display="38:30" %}} - created humans and then based on the structure of the Human family decided that he was going to follow that same  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2316" display="38:36" %}} - structure right that is and this is very typical of typology um within how typology comes up in biblical  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2325" display="38:45" %}} - interpretation is God is what we would call the real version of something and then we see the patterns that come from  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2334" display="38:54" %}} - um God or the spiritual how he's organized the church manifest in the physical world or in human  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2341" display="39:01" %}} - relationships in a way that mirrors the spiritual but the spiritual didn't copy from the human the human copied from the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2347" display="39:07" %}} - spiritual that's sort of the order of the typology here um so this is where the idea of the fatherhood of God comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2355" display="39:15" %}} - from now of course we only picked a couple passages here um these are not the only passages in the Old Testament  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2361" display="39:21" %}} - they get at this idea um you know this comes up in uh the Psalms this comes up in you know the gospels all over the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2369" display="39:29" %}} - place you know Jesus obviously in his kosis as the Incarnation of you know praise to God the Father you know and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2377" display="39:37" %}} - this is how we are told to pray in the Lord's Prayer as well um you know Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2383" display="39:43" %}} - name right um so it obviously a critical part of kind of understanding our relationship to the member of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2392" display="39:52" %}} - godhead as Audi has articulated before that is the the representation of deity within the Trinity um the one who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2400" display="40:00" %}} - carries the authority um and this is how the roles have been adopted as we'll go through more as we go here but this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2407" display="40:07" %}} - kind of where we get it from in scripture and so that's the origin of the name uh the name of the role being  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2414" display="40:14" %}} - father and this idea of fatherhood well what is the significance of this so when we talk about the fatherhood of God this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2422" display="40:22" %}} - is clearly intended to be taken as an analogy from Human Experience um and so uh we've talked elsewhere um you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2431" display="40:31" %}} - know and ikis certainly does as well about this idea of anthropopathism that sometimes we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2438" display="40:38" %}} - ascribe emotions to God um to help us better understand him so the wine press of God's Wrath anger ascribed to God um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2447" display="40:47" %}} - uh a as as you know someone holding the sword of judgment against Injustice in the world or evil in the world so that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2454" display="40:54" %}} - an anthropopathism this is somewhat anthrop morphic of God as well in that you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2460" display="41:00" %}} - God is our father not so much that we are baby Gods you know in the sense that that animals have you know young that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2469" display="41:09" %}} - are of a kind with them God is our father in this metaphorical sense um and you know in every positive way that our  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2478" display="41:18" %}} - human fathers have that relationship with us God is that but better right and we'll get into that a little bit more in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2485" display="41:25" %}} - a second here so like the father who sired us physically so like our human fathers um God is uh the the one who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2493" display="41:33" %}} - brought us into the world right um you know in fact in the more real sent as I say it's kind of an intensification in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2499" display="41:39" %}} - every way because our human fathers you know had a role in you know us coming into the world but they didn't form our  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2505" display="41:45" %}} - human spirits that was God right um like a father so that is like a human father he's our authority figure that's the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2513" display="41:53" %}} - role of men in marriage and the family right our trainer our discipline Arian and our teacher so this passage here in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2520" display="42:00" %}} - Hebrews chap 12 um this is a a passage known for the discipline of God um so um I'm just going to read uh most of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2529" display="42:09" %}} - here Hebrews chap 12: 5 through1 and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as Sons my son do not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2537" display="42:17" %}} - regard lightly the discipline of the Lord nor faint when you are reproved by him For Those whom the Lord loves he  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2543" display="42:23" %}} - disciplines and he scores every son whom he receives it is for discipline that you endure God deals with you as with  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2551" display="42:31" %}} - sons for what son is there whom his father does not discipline but if you are without discipline of which all have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2558" display="42:38" %}} - become partakers then you are illegitimate children and not Sons furthermore we had Earthly fathers to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2564" display="42:44" %}} - discipline us and we respected them shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live for they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2570" display="42:50" %}} - disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good so that we may share his  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2576" display="42:56" %}} - holy all discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful yet to those  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2581" display="43:01" %}} - who have been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness so this passage talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2589" display="43:09" %}} - about God's discipline of us and you can see the analogy in full swing here because we actually bring up how God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2595" display="43:15" %}} - discipline is like the discipline of Earthly fathers except only for our good so that we may share his Holiness right  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2603" display="43:23" %}} - we we mentioned this intensification of fatherhood if you will um our human fathers even as good as they might be or  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2610" display="43:30" %}} - might have been they don't have perfect information like God does um so it's not only it's not only the discipline um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2621" display="43:41" %}} - that is one side of the father's responsibility in a household but he's also the one in a family who's supposed  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2627" display="43:47" %}} - to love and care for us who protects us keeps us safe wants only what's best for us regardless of what we see as best I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2635" display="43:55" %}} - also traditionally the provider in the household the one who is um kind of making sure that everyone in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2641" display="44:01" %}} - household has what they need um and is protected from um you know threats out external to the home um so that is human  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2649" display="44:09" %}} - fathers but Gods like that accept better in every way right and so this is the point that we may just kind of going  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2655" display="44:15" %}} - back to this uh being finite human beings our Earthly fathers had strength and weaknesses and despite their best  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2662" display="44:22" %}} - intentions um they had to act on the basis of imperfect information about what's actually best for us so uh if  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2669" display="44:29" %}} - you've ever had a child who does something wrong especially since different children are different and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2673" display="44:33" %}} - respond to discipline in different ways sometimes it can be really hard to figure out what you're supposed to do to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2679" display="44:39" %}} - kind of teach a child the lesson that they need to be taught right so maybe touching hot stoves is dangerous or uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2687" display="44:47" %}} - crossing the street without looking both ways is dangerous but how do you instill that into your child parenting is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2692" display="44:52" %}} - easy business right um but unlike finite human beings who you know even if they do their very best will never be perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2701" display="45:01" %}} - Our Father in Heaven does not have these limitations he always knows what is best for us he always does what is best for  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2709" display="45:09" %}} - us you know even if we don't like it even if we don't see it at the time so in this way God represents the perfect  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2716" display="45:16" %}} - ideal of fatherhood he is not limited in the way that human beings are um so he acts towards us always in perfect love  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2723" display="45:23" %}} - and what he does for us is without question for our ultimate good and this we might think of Romans chapter 8:28  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2729" display="45:29" %}} - for all things work together for the good of those who love him um and that you know that is true generally speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2735" display="45:35" %}} - of parents who want the best for their children that is ever so much more true for our father uh that we have in God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2742" display="45:42" %}} - the god of the universe because he has the power to make it happen uh God's will is always done and so no matter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2749" display="45:49" %}} - what God does in relation to us whether he disciplines us or blesses us he does so in perfect knowledge of who we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2755" display="45:55" %}} - and of all that is in our Hearts um so he knows our minds and our intentions even before we act all right so that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2762" display="46:02" %}} - the significance here of this idea of fatherhood the fatherhood of the role of father in the Trinity this is why we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2770" display="46:10" %}} - call him God the father because this is the way in which he relates to us and so finally that brings us to the person so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2777" display="46:17" %}} - the father um the member of the Trinity bearing this name um going through uh relating to Creation in this way in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2786" display="46:26" %}} - role is referred to as the first person of the Trinity and this is because he speaks in the authoritative first person  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2793" display="46:33" %}} - the I person he decrees things um he speaks as the representation of deity as Audi has put it um he speaks to us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2802" display="46:42" %}} - directly he mandates things um and in this he's directly manifesting his manifesting his authoritative will as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2810" display="46:50" %}} - our God creator and the ruler of the Universe um so this passage before from Exodus 3 we have already talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2818" display="46:58" %}} - this I think we actually almost opened the very first lesson of this study talking about this of God's essence of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2824" display="47:04" %}} - being you know the the one who is He Who exists I am who I am in this way we would say that this is representative of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2833" display="47:13" %}} - the father's decrees the father's claims he's speaking in the first person here um and so this is Exodus chapter 3 veres  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2841" display="47:21" %}} - 14- 15 um talking about I am has sent me to you right God uh stating for all time that we are to know him as the one who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2850" display="47:30" %}} - is um you know and who was and who is to come and then we also have this passage here from Isaiah chapter 46 and this one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2859" display="47:39" %}} - um is again God talking in the first person this is this idea of the role of the father being the one who gives  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2868" display="47:48" %}} - authoritative decrees so this is Isaiah chapter6 veres 9-10 so remember the former things long past for I am God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2876" display="47:56" %}} - there is no other I am God and there is no one like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2882" display="48:02" %}} - things which have not been done saying my purpose will be established and I will accomplish all my good pleasure so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2889" display="48:09" %}} - you see that this is God decreeing his his authoritative will creation will bow to his decrees and this is the authority  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2900" display="48:20" %}} - of this person in the Trinity and this is kind of why we associate um the father in The Trinity with the first  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2906" display="48:26" %}} - person um this is how God decrees things in creation so I know we've been through a lot here um and and we could certainly  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2915" display="48:35" %}} - flesh out um any that we've gone through Audi do you have places you want to start as we discuss the father as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2921" display="48:41" %}} - first person in the Trinity okay so I think you've uh essentially um covered it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2932" display="48:52" %}} - uh it's it's it's really the role of the father um the the the progenitor The Protector  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2941" display="49:01" %}} - the everything that um a father would be or should be to Creation so yeah I don't think there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2950" display="49:10" %}} - is much else that I would I can't imagine anything I would that I would just reiterate a lot of the things that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2957" display="49:17" %}} - you have said essentially yeah next we're going to be talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2965" display="49:25" %}} - about the Sun as the second person of the Trinity so just how we talked about the origin of the name or title father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2974" display="49:34" %}} - uh for um the member in the Trinity who bears that name uh we're going to be talking about the same thing for the sun  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2981" display="49:41" %}} - here um so uh there's this verse here in Job chapter 38 this is an interesting verse um actually gets into the idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2989" display="49:49" %}} - recreation um the Angels actually being there as uh God was recreating the Universe um kind of poses a theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="2997" display="49:57" %}} - issue for people who don't hold to uh the Gap Theory or ruin reconstruction is that well how are angels existent before  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3004" display="50:04" %}} - the universe if you don't believe what we believe um but you know that aside this verse talking about the sons of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3011" display="50:11" %}} - in Job chapter 38 are referring to Angels so angels are sons of God in the same way that humans are in that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3018" display="50:18" %}} - important sense that God is our creator he's our progenitor if you want to use that term um he's the one who has  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3026" display="50:26" %}} - Authority over us who loves us who does the things in our best interest who disciplines us grows us now obviously  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3032" display="50:32" %}} - elect Angels they intellectual capacity how they work how their free will works it's all a little bit different from  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3039" display="50:39" %}} - humans um but it's the same idea generally speaking that they answer to God in the same way that we answer to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3046" display="50:46" %}} - God uh you know God the Father um so they are sons of God um now we are also all referred to as sons of God so I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3054" display="50:54" %}} - just going to read some references here most of these are not like hard references to follow so in Romans  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3059" display="50:59" %}} - chapter 8 um it says Romans 8 chapter chapter 8 ver14 says for all who are being led by the spirit of God these are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3067" display="51:07" %}} - sons of God so that's Believers right um Galatians chapter 3: 26 for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3075" display="51:15" %}} - Jesus uh Galatians chapter 4:5 so that he might redeem those who were under the law that we might receive  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3082" display="51:22" %}} - the adoption as sons and then you can also compare John chap 1:2 but as many as received him to them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3090" display="51:30" %}} - he gave the right to become children of God even to those who believe in his name and then 1 John chapter 3 uh uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3098" display="51:38" %}} - verses 1- two see how great a love the father has bestowed on us that we would be called children of God and such we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3105" display="51:45" %}} - are for this reason the world does not know us because it did not know him um so I'm going have to go read the second  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3112" display="51:52" %}} - verse um beloved now we are children of God and it has not appeared as yet we will be we know that when he appears we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3118" display="51:58" %}} - will be like him because we will see him just as he is so two mentions in 1 John chapter 3 veres 1- two of us being  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3127" display="52:07" %}} - children of God so angels are sons of God Believers are sons of God and so this widespread franchise of sunship  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3137" display="52:17" %}} - that's how ikus has put this here this idea of sunship is based upon the paternal position of the father relative  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3144" display="52:24" %}} - to all of his obedient creatures however and this is where we're going to Pivot to Jesus Christ there's only one the Son  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3152" display="52:32" %}} - of God with the definite article and that's our Lord Jesus Christ um so angels are sons of God believing humans  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3159" display="52:39" %}} - well actually believing angels are sons of God believing humans are sons of God but there's only one the Son of God with  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3164" display="52:44" %}} - a definite article um so we're goingon to take a step back here talk about the Incarnation relative to uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3172" display="52:52" %}} - proceedings in the law so Christ incarnation in the Old Testament was in a veiled fashion prophecied and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3179" display="52:59" %}} - foreshadowed by ritual and sacrifice so it remained in Old Testament times very much a mystery until the time of his  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3186" display="53:06" %}} - actual first Advent um so now with the benefit of hindsight we see how Jesus was revealed as the archetypical Son of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3195" display="53:15" %}} - God um and that the Old Testament parallels are actually types that look forward to this Revelation and so if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3201" display="53:21" %}} - remember just before when we were talking about the father I I made this mention that anytime we have this this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3207" display="53:27" %}} - sort of idea of typology it's always the spiritual realities that are the real thing and the human analogies that are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3214" display="53:34" %}} - the types the parallels um sort of Shadows makes it sound like bad it's not bad um it's just the human parallels  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3223" display="53:43" %}} - copied the Divine not the other way around right um and so we have quite the list here um and so again we're kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3230" display="53:50" %}} - determining where is this origin of the title of sun coming from where where we we getting this how is it manifested in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3238" display="53:58" %}} - scripture um so we're going to go through some Old Testament types here um some places where we see this idea of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3246" display="54:06" %}} - sunship present so one really obvious one is Christ as the last Adam so Adam is called the Son of God we might  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3255" display="54:15" %}} - compare Luke Chapter 3: 38 um you know the son of enosh the son of Seth the son of Adam the Son of God so Adam is called  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3263" display="54:23" %}} - there the Son of God um Christ however is the preeminent last Adam so we have this verse here in 1 Corinthians chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3270" display="54:30" %}} - 15 talking about how uh the first man Adam became a living Soul the last Adam referring to Christ became a lifegiving  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3279" display="54:39" %}} - spirit um if I'm not mistaken Romans chapter 5 talks about similar things as well um interestingly we actually have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3286" display="54:46" %}} - this passage in Daniel chapter 7 as well talking about like a son of man um one like a son of man was coming so I'll  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3293" display="54:53" %}} - read this this is Daniel chapter 7: 13 through 14 I kept looking in the night visions and behold with the cloud of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3301" display="55:01" %}} - Heaven one like a son of man was coming and he came up to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him and to him  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3308" display="55:08" %}} - was given Dominion glory and a kingdom that all the peoples nations of men of every language might serve him his  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3315" display="55:15" %}} - Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which will not pass away and his kingdom is one which will not be destroyed so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3322" display="55:22" %}} - one like a son of man right um so so this is Christ as the Fulfillment the last Adam um as well as other usage in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3331" display="55:31" %}} - the New Testament um so Adam was a Son of God but Christ is the preeminent last Adam um now interestingly um Adam you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3340" display="55:40" %}} - know that's the name we use in English or Adam as the Hebrew word it means man literally um and so Jesus is the last  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3349" display="55:49" %}} - Adam um and so this is one of the types that points us to this idea of sunship um so another one um and this is where  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3357" display="55:57" %}} - we get into the idea of um sort of the subordination of the son to the father's will um we talk about Israel as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3366" display="56:06" %}} - servant of God um so there's this passage in the middle part of Isaiah chapter 42 um you know Isaiah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3373" display="56:13" %}} - remonstrating with the Israelites here talking about um the Israelites as the servant of God um so this one's a little  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3380" display="56:20" %}} - bit long I may not I may not read this whole passage but um it is conveying the sense here of the Israelites as being  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3390" display="56:30" %}} - the servant of the Lord um and so you know positionally Israel as we read before you know in Exodus 4:22 said to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3398" display="56:38" %}} - be the Son of God right if Israel is the Son Well Israel is also the servant of God um but Christ is the suffering  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3405" display="56:45" %}} - servant who takes Away The Sins Of The World um and this will be uh kind of a familiar passage to many if we go uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3413" display="56:53" %}} - with the passage picking up in Exodus chapter 52 and going sorry not Exodus Isaiah chapter 52 going into 53 uh this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3420" display="57:00" %}} - is the famous passage of the suffering servant right um you know very Messianic in nature um common for this to be read  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3428" display="57:08" %}} - uh during cor isort of the Christmas time as we Ponder how um it was that that the son came into the world you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3436" display="57:16" %}} - know the Incarnation um but the suffering servant Christ as the suffering servant right Israel was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3443" display="57:23" %}} - servant of God that suffered but Christ is the suffering servant again you see the typology here in work um so I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3450" display="57:30" %}} - this is powerful stuff I I love this passage but again kind of long not going to read the whole thing here um but this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3456" display="57:36" %}} - is where we are getting the idea of sunship and specifically what it means for for the second person in the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3464" display="57:44" %}} - to take on human flesh and become a servant right that context we get in part from this passage here in Isaiah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3471" display="57:51" %}} - chapter 52 and 53 um so just as Israel is the servant of God Christ is the suffering servant who takes away the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3479" display="57:59" %}} - sins of the world and then we also have just Israel's God's son generally speaking Christ is the Son of God right  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3486" display="58:06" %}} - so um interesting passage here in Hosea chapter 11 talks about when Israel was a youth I loved him and out of Egypt I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3493" display="58:13" %}} - called my son um uh Matthew is actually pretty clear that um when Joseph uh took Mary and baby Jesus to Egypt to flee  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3501" display="58:21" %}} - herod's persecution and then Egypt came back it's actually the Fulfillment of this this was a prophecy um and we see  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3507" display="58:27" %}} - that in Matthew chapter 2:15 um he remained there I think the he here is Joseph probably in context he remained  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3514" display="58:34" %}} - there until the death of Herod that this was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet out of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3520" display="58:40" %}} - Egypt I called my son um and again Jesus as the Son of God and then uh folks who are familiar with um sort of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3529" display="58:49" %}} - tracing the the so-called Messianic passages in the Old Testament will kind of be familiar with these um we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3536" display="58:56" %}} - Jesus as kind of the son of David right so David's direct line the line of Savior has Solomon as his son but Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3546" display="59:06" %}} - is the son of David right um and in this way we can see this in in Psalm 2 which is certainly a Messianic Psalm um so um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3556" display="59:16" %}} - this is you know commonly comes up when we discuss the idea of the Incarnation and you know it's not that the second  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3563" display="59:23" %}} - person in the Trinity is a created being um but we're talking about Jesus's human nature in his kosis um Psalm you know I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3571" display="59:31" %}} - let me actually read this these verses um verses 7 through2 um so this is speaking of the Incarnation um Psalm 2  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3579" display="59:39" %}} - picking up at verse 7 I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord he said to me you are my son today I have begotten you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3586" display="59:46" %}} - ask of me and I will surely give the Nations as your inheritance and the Very ends of the Earth is your possession you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3592" display="59:52" %}} - shall break them with a rod of iron you shall shatter them like Earth and wear now therefore O King show discernment  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3598" display="59:58" %}} - take warning or oh judges of the earth Worship the Lord with reverence and rejoice with trembling do homage to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3605" display="01:00:05" %}} - son that he not become angry and you perish in the way for his wrath May soon be kindled how blessed are all who take  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3612" display="01:00:12" %}} - refuge in him um so again speaking of the Incarnation of the son here so that's Psalm chapter 2 also Psalm  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3621" display="01:00:21" %}} - chapter 110 um speaking of the Lord says to my Lord s at my right hand until I make  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3628" display="01:00:28" %}} - your enemies as a foot stol for your feet so um if we look at Psalm 110 you know this is the idea of the Lord says  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3638" display="01:00:38" %}} - to my Lord you know not David but the Lord of David right this is Christ the Messianic Psalm speaking of Christ as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3647" display="01:00:47" %}} - the descendant of David right the one who came after him yet was greater than him um so in all of these ways we see  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3654" display="01:00:54" %}} - that the like we we kind of see where sunship comes from in scripture um so Christ has all of these types in the Old  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3662" display="01:01:02" %}} - Testament these things that point to him um and this isn't to say that Christ is like Bound by the typology right Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3669" display="01:01:09" %}} - is the Son of God he fulfills um as the perfect archetype everything that Adam and Israel and even Solomon as David's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3679" display="01:01:19" %}} - son he fulfilled everything that they kind of were supposed to to a higher standard and intensification if you will  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3686" display="01:01:26" %}} - um so that's the origin of the sun here and when when we talk about the significance of it this is where we sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3692" display="01:01:32" %}} - of get into U the somewhat um difficult to wrap our heads around topic of the subordination of the son to the father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3701" display="01:01:41" %}} - authoritative will particularly during the Incarnation under kenosis when Jesus was emptied out of his divinity um fully  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3710" display="01:01:50" %}} - God yet fully man but not taking advantage of his divinity during the Incarnation um so with that kind of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3717" display="01:01:57" %}} - backdrop here um sunship takes on this idea of submission of obeying the will of God the Father um so building on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3726" display="01:02:06" %}} - idea of fatherhood as discussed before with God the Father sunship denotes the idea of a special and unbreakable  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3733" display="01:02:13" %}} - relationship with the father and you can see this um as Jesus you know throughout the gospels talks about the father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3741" display="01:02:21" %}} - will as one who knows the father's will right he is unmistakably the son of God who speaks for the father um but there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3749" display="01:02:29" %}} - also dutiful subordination to the father's will but at the same time that he submitting he also has privilege  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3755" display="01:02:35" %}} - inheritance and shared Authority um now if we take a step back for a second this is actually really helpful for helping  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3762" display="01:02:42" %}} - us understand what it means for the son to be subordinate to the father yet not necessarily unequal with the father um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3770" display="01:02:50" %}} - Dr lugan B uses an example of the King's son uh we might think specifically the term might be Crown Prince right the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3778" display="01:02:58" %}} - who is to be the next ruler um well in you know an absolute monarchy or an an Empire with an emperor and that sort of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3786" display="01:03:06" %}} - thing um typically the people who sit on the throne are sort of unapproachable um you know you don't have access to them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3792" display="01:03:12" %}} - they cannot hear the plights of normal people they're kind of Out Of Reach I mean if we take that idea and we map  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3799" display="01:03:19" %}} - this on to the father and the son again human analogies only being the Shadows or the reflections of the Divine ones  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3807" display="01:03:27" %}} - well in the same way here um the Crown Prince or the King's son might play the role of a mediator between the king and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3816" display="01:03:36" %}} - his offending subjects and that role can only be played by someone who is on a par with both the father King and with  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3825" display="01:03:45" %}} - the subjects and so for Jesus Christ for us plays this role he has a human nature he is one of us the Bible says that he  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3833" display="01:03:53" %}} - understands because he lived a human being but he has equality with with God it also says that equality with God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3842" display="01:04:02" %}} - not something that he has to reach for he's had it since eternity passed this is the role of the son he is the one who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3850" display="01:04:10" %}} - is accessible to us the one whom we can uh tell our not not our complaints who who advocates for us who is a listening  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3858" display="01:04:18" %}} - ear the one who we talk to who then appeals on our behalf to the father as only the Crown Prince can as only the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3867" display="01:04:27" %}} - King's son can and only a son the Incarnation of the son the Incarnation of the one subordinating himself to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3876" display="01:04:36" %}} - father's will he is the only such person who could be sent on the mission of reconciliation um so we have this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3883" display="01:04:43" %}} - passage here in Matthew chapter 21 um and I'm going to read through this this is very very on point for sort of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3893" display="01:04:53" %}} - role of the son in Rec ilation God's plan to make peace with mankind yet what mankind does in response so this is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3903" display="01:05:03" %}} - parable of the landowner so picking up it Matthew chap 1: 33 listen to another Parable there was a landowner who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3911" display="01:05:11" %}} - planted a Vineyard and put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it and built a tower and rented it out to vine  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3917" display="01:05:17" %}} - Growers and went on a journey when the Harvest Time approached he sent his slaves to the vine Growers to receive  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3922" display="01:05:22" %}} - his produce the vine Growers took his slaves and beat one and killed another and stoned a third again he sent another  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3929" display="01:05:29" %}} - group of slaves larger than the first and they did the same thing to them but afterward he sent his son to them saying  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3936" display="01:05:36" %}} - they will respect my son but when the vine grower saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3943" display="01:05:43" %}} - kill him and seize his inheritance they took him and they threw him out of the vineyard and they killed him therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3950" display="01:05:50" %}} - when the owner of the Vineyard comes what will he do to those fine Growers you know and Jesus is speaking this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3956" display="01:05:56" %}} - against the Pharisees of course but the point for us in talking about the role of the sun is you see how the role of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3963" display="01:06:03" %}} - the son is different than the groups of servants that came before the son carries the authority of the father of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3971" display="01:06:11" %}} - the land owner here he is the heir he is the Crown Prince the one whom these people ought to respect because he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3979" display="01:06:19" %}} - playing the role of mediator between them and the landowner but they don't respect him so this is the role of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3985" display="01:06:25" %}} - son in reconciliation for us um and so we will perhaps talk more about this as we try to Grapple with this idea of uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="3995" display="01:06:35" %}} - the subordination of the Incarnate son to the father's will and things like that but the son's role of mediation of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4001" display="01:06:41" %}} - reconciliation is only possible because he's fully God and fully man and that brings us to the person of the son and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4010" display="01:06:50" %}} - what makes us refer to the son in the second person is the fact that he is accessible to us we can speak to him as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4020" display="01:07:00" %}} - someone who took on a human nature who appeared in the flesh to forge a relationship with us on the father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4026" display="01:07:06" %}} - behalf as the mediator between us and unapproachable deity and so passage here in uh John chapter 15: 14-15 Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4037" display="01:07:17" %}} - calling the disciples his friends so uh John 15 ver4 you are my friends if you do what I command you no no longer do I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4046" display="01:07:26" %}} - call you slaves for the slave does not know what his master is doing but I have called you friends for all things that I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4052" display="01:07:32" %}} - have heard from my father I have made known to you so Jesus comes bearing the father's will but he came to forge  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4060" display="01:07:40" %}} - relationships with us to be our Advocate to be accessible someone who we talk to someone who can appeal to the father on  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4067" display="01:07:47" %}} - our behalf and he has gained access to the father for us he intercedes for us we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4074" display="01:07:54" %}} - have an ear into the sorry we have an in to the throne room of God through Jesus Christ um so some passages for that John  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4082" display="01:08:02" %}} - Chapter 14 verse six Jesus said to him I am the way and the truth of the life no one comes to the father but through me  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4089" display="01:08:09" %}} - so Jesus playing that role of mediator between us and the father Ephesians chapter 2 verse 18 for through him we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4099" display="01:08:19" %}} - both have our access in one Spirit to the father we have access to the throne room of God through Jesus Christ and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4107" display="01:08:27" %}} - then also Ephesians 3:12 in whom who he being Christ we have boldness and competent access through  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4115" display="01:08:35" %}} - faith in him so this is Jesus in his role as the mediator the one through whom we have access to God the Father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4126" display="01:08:46" %}} - who has authority over us um so again just as before kind of talked for a long time here um aie do you have more you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4134" display="01:08:54" %}} - want to say um maybe particularly on that idea of subordination um and and how we work  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4141" display="01:09:01" %}} - that into the equality that the members of the Trinity share  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4146" display="01:09:06" %}} - so as you said the uh sun is a a role that uh uh was created specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4157" display="01:09:17" %}} - for um I would say the Redemption because of course as we know the Redemption of the of of of of human  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4167" display="01:09:27" %}} - beings is the Lynch  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4173" display="01:09:33" %}} - pin of creation that creation will work is that that Redemption happen so we talk about the cross being the the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4183" display="01:09:43" %}} - central truth the foundational truth of creation so that was only possible because one member of the trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4195" display="01:09:55" %}} - was willing to subordinate himself to another essentially to say I will serve at your command so whatever  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4208" display="01:10:08" %}} - you say is what I'll do was an elected thing every time that anyone else has tried to explain this by talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4216" display="01:10:16" %}} - how the Sun was generated um eternally as they as they put it that he was somehow generated  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4226" display="01:10:26" %}} - from the father misses the point entirely if he is God then he was not generated if he was generated then he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4235" display="01:10:35" %}} - not God so essentially the the place of this uh this this particular role was was you could say designed by the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4247" display="01:10:47" %}} - in order to make Redemption possible and uh when we when we speak to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4256" display="01:10:56" %}} - uh subordination that we just talked about again it's it's it's just a choice that the second person of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4266" display="01:11:06" %}} - Trinity that is that the the the member of the godhead that's elected to be the son chose in order to realize the plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4278" display="01:11:18" %}} - of God he was not subordinate to the father because there was a power gradients there one of them being  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4288" display="01:11:28" %}} - greater than the other that's not how that worked it was that when creation comes into  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4295" display="01:11:35" %}} - existence I will play this role which is a role where I will be servant to you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4304" display="01:11:44" %}} - and since he was going to take on uh a human nature as well this was going to be sort of a permanent thing because you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4315" display="01:11:55" %}} - you see that in 1 Corinthians 15 It also says that um the son will eventually be subject to the father of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4324" display="01:12:04" %}} - course he he is he always is that he will turn over the kingdom to to to the father and he too will be in subjection  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4334" display="01:12:14" %}} - to the father that's because the um what's it called the uh human nature that he acquires remains extent  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4346" display="01:12:26" %}} - throughout uh eternity it will never be removed anymore so in his human nature he is actually subservient to the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4355" display="01:12:35" %}} - but in his deity is equal to the father so um I think that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4362" display="01:12:42" %}} - uh that's what I can say at the moment about that I'm looking for this passage you might be able to help me aie um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4371" display="01:12:51" %}} - maybe it's this I'm thinking of when um hold on trying to find the verse reference here Matthew 19 verse 27 maybe  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4381" display="01:13:01" %}} - where the apostles came and they asked who is g to be the greatest right and Jesus yeah talks about becoming servants  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4388" display="01:13:08" %}} - do you know what I'm talking about um yes yes I do uh I think you okay so it was James and John  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4398" display="01:13:18" %}} - right if I'm not sure if it was John but it was how how you could find it as a uh um here we go this looks prom he he  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4409" display="01:13:29" %}} - brought a child among them so let me there were there were two or three other places yeah we're going on I mean yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4418" display="01:13:38" %}} - that that was the Matthew 18 that I that I found but this was specifically the one I was thinking of the sons of zebede  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4424" display="01:13:44" %}} - um so this is Mark chapter 10 vers 35 and following um verse 35 says James and John the sons of zebede came to him  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4431" display="01:13:51" %}} - teacher they said we want you to do for us whatever we ask you know of course they don't lead with what they want  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4437" display="01:13:57" %}} - right but um verse 36 what do you want me to do for you he asked they replied let one of us sit at your right and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4443" display="01:14:03" %}} - other it's your left in your glory you don't know what you are asking Jesus said can you drink the cup I drink or be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4450" display="01:14:10" %}} - baptized with the baptism I am baptized with we can they answered not knowing what they were signing up for Jesus said  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4459" display="01:14:19" %}} - to them you will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I baptized with but to sit at my right or  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4465" display="01:14:25" %}} - left is not for me to Grant these places belong to those for whom they have been prepared when the 10 heard about this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4472" display="01:14:32" %}} - they became indignant with James and John Jesus called them together and said you know that those who are regarded as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4478" display="01:14:38" %}} - rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them and their High officials exercise authority over them not so with you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4485" display="01:14:45" %}} - instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be slave  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4492" display="01:14:52" %}} - of all for even the son of man did not come to be Serv but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many so why I'm  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4499" display="01:14:59" %}} - bringing up this passage is to get at the idea that the one who has the most Authority is the one who serves most of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4509" display="01:15:09" %}} - all this doesn't mean that the son is greater than the father but this idea that in service there is there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4515" display="01:15:15" %}} - necessarily inferior power right um because if you look through the New Testament Jesus is uniform in insisting  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4523" display="01:15:23" %}} - that whoever wants to be greatest must be least of all he must dedicate himself to service um and this idea that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4531" display="01:15:31" %}} - dedicating yourself to service necessarily debases you um I don't know where we get that from really I mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4537" display="01:15:37" %}} - like throughout a lot of history a lot of what I would call the noble aristocratic classes have had this idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4543" display="01:15:43" %}} - that only peasants do hard physical labor you know that sort of thing right um they they they try to make it a class  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4549" display="01:15:49" %}} - distinction but that's not present in the Bible so when we think of Jesus you know subordinating himself to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4557" display="01:15:57" %}} - father's will serving as the sacrifice for Humanity laying down his life to save Humanity why do we think of that as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4565" display="01:16:05" %}} - lesser now to be clear there is the idea of subordination in kosis um and and coming back to that again a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4574" display="01:16:14" %}} - when we hear about the human part of Jesus subordinating himself to the father you know Jesus goes at Great  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4581" display="01:16:21" %}} - Lengths on about the father's will and I have come to D to do the will of him who sent me right you know he uses wording  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4588" display="01:16:28" %}} - like this frequently but you know that can be true um and that's not you know it it's complicated in how the Divinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4597" display="01:16:37" %}} - of the second person of the Trinity interacts with um the Incarnation um because for example uh the Judgment for  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4604" display="01:16:44" %}} - human sin upon the cross wasn't just the human person Jesus emptied completely of his divinity Jesus had to be fully God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4610" display="01:16:50" %}} - and fully man for the sacrifice for our sins but in his subordination to the father's will you know part of that was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4619" display="01:16:59" %}} - going to the Cross to die for us and that wasn't just the human part of Jesus right um but God had this as a purpose  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4628" display="01:17:08" %}} - from eternity past um you know something else I don't want to ramble here but um eth this has made the point you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4635" display="01:17:15" %}} - this is just necessarily true because of God's omniscience but before God created the universe he knew that Jesus was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4643" display="01:17:23" %}} - going to be sent to die to save us from our sin right creating the universe meant that that step was sure and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4650" display="01:17:30" %}} - certain um you know for us as finite beings Bound by time we we don't think like this but to God creating the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4656" display="01:17:36" %}} - universe meant that Jesus would go die on the cross that's what it meant when God took that step of creation that was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4663" display="01:17:43" %}} - set in stone that's how the Divine decrees work everything is for ordained right you know based on God's forn  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4670" display="01:17:50" %}} - knowledge of our Free Will and so on but just think about that for a second right the the Trinity from the time they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4676" display="01:17:56" %}} - created the universe knew that this was coming and Jesus still went down to be born in weak human vesture to live a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4686" display="01:18:06" %}} - life of immense suffering to die for our sins even so right um but in this um you know a couple other analogies um and uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4698" display="01:18:18" %}} - uh you know again maybe I'm jumping all over the place here but um when we think about responsibilities too I I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4705" display="01:18:25" %}} - something else that comes up is um 1 Corinthians 12 maybe you know how we all have our spiritual gifts all have our  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4712" display="01:18:32" %}} - things in the church and we don't get to look down on people who have different gifts from us um and if you've ever  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4721" display="01:18:41" %}} - worked on a team um you know most of us uh here on this call probably aren't in the military but you probably heard  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4728" display="01:18:48" %}} - about things like you know you have sergeants and enlisted men and then you have the officers right and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4733" display="01:18:53" %}} - traditionally there's always sort of a tension between these groups of people but in the end they come together to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4740" display="01:19:00" %}} - meet the objectives of their unit right and is one greater or lesser than the other one of them has commanding  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4747" display="01:19:07" %}} - Authority but does that make that person better um and it's complicated you know that analogy is imperfect because there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4755" display="01:19:15" %}} - is such a thing as Rank and Authority in the military and that's not true of the people in the Trinity right we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4761" display="01:19:21" %}} - taken great pains already in our study to emphasize that there is no inequality within the unity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4768" display="01:19:28" %}} - of the Trinity there cannot be any of that no disparity in status or Eternal function or substance right um but you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4778" display="01:19:38" %}} - can have different people on the same team that do different things and one of those people is the one who says do this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4785" display="01:19:45" %}} - dot that and the other people follow that does that mean that there's inequality there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4792" display="01:19:52" %}} - inherently you know a you want to pick up again sorry I've kind of gone several directions here but um yeah I I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4801" display="01:20:01" %}} - this the the main the main idea um that I would uh I would hold out is this the position  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4812" display="01:20:12" %}} - of the the way the Trinity works is that in so far as the three persons involved are each God in their  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4824" display="01:20:24" %}} - own right they're equal to each other but when it comes to how they working to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4833" display="01:20:33" %}} - realize the the plan for creation that they have as God in that particular um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4844" display="01:20:44" %}} - dynamic they do not actually if you will compete for equality the father is held out by the both the other two members of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4854" display="01:20:54" %}} - the church Trinity as being the greatest and the reason for that is not that they are any less God or they are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4863" display="01:21:03" %}} - less powerful or they of less Authority than him no it is for the sake of that plan earlier in this series we talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4872" display="01:21:12" %}} - about the fact that one member of the Trinity is actually presented by the Bible as being  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4881" display="01:21:21" %}} - the face of God in other words most places that you see um the word god used in the Scriptures it is him to which it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4893" display="01:21:33" %}} - refers uh for example when we go to that First Corinthians 15 that we talked about if memory serves me right uh I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4901" display="01:21:41" %}} - actually have my Bible right here let me just um pull that up to make sure I'm accurate on what I'm saying in 1  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4909" display="01:21:49" %}} - Corinthians 15 it it actually  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4915" display="01:21:55" %}} - holds that everything that is put under in subjection to Christ everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4923" display="01:22:03" %}} - is put in in subjection to Christ is does not include God himself and later on the son himself is made  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4933" display="01:22:13" %}} - subject to him so the only place to see God the father as in where the father is mentioned is in verse 24 when it says  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4941" display="01:22:21" %}} - then the end will come when he he hands over the kingdom to God the Father specifying which member of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4947" display="01:22:27" %}} - to whom the kingdom is handed um but the point here is most times that you see the word God use it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4957" display="01:22:37" %}} - refers to the father without there isn't any um uh provision of clarification as to which member of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4968" display="01:22:48" %}} - because all three members of the Trinity agreed that the father would be the faith of God the face of the Trinity the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4976" display="01:22:56" %}} - one who who who is presented as the representation of God to Creation but when we go to um Genesis 3 the Lord God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4989" display="01:23:09" %}} - that we see talked about all the time there is actually the second person of the Trinity it's not the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="4996" display="01:23:16" %}} - himself and this is because of the role of the son and then when we go to uh Zechariah Chapter 2 and I believe vers 8  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5005" display="01:23:25" %}} - and N or so I've mentioned that passage a few times we see that the person who is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5011" display="01:23:31" %}} - saying or of whom it was speaking the person who said um thus say this is how it was put thus says the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5021" display="01:23:41" %}} - God do you have that it's I have that look right yes that's it that's it for this is what the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5028" display="01:23:48" %}} - Almighty says after the Glorious one has sent me out against Nations have plundered you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5035" display="01:23:55" %}} - and so on and so forth so in in other translations you will have th says this is what the Lord God says after after  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5046" display="01:24:06" %}} - the Lord God has sent me after you know Glory or something of that sort the idea here is you have the Lord God and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5056" display="01:24:16" %}} - Lord God is you know the second person of the Trinity that's actually the person who is speaking in Zechariah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5062" display="01:24:22" %}} - Chapter 2 again so it's not as if we're saying that um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5071" display="01:24:31" %}} - um the the the the title God or that first of all that there is any disparity of of power or position in the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5081" display="01:24:41" %}} - there is none but also for the sake of the plan that they have for creation the two the other two members of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5089" display="01:24:49" %}} - are fine with having a representation of themselves in the scriptures that appears to suggest that they subordinate  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5101" display="01:25:01" %}} - to the father so the son for example is the son he is the son even before he becomes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5110" display="01:25:10" %}} - human he's not he's not the son purely due to his Humanity he is the son because that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5118" display="01:25:18" %}} - the role that he chose to play and the father is greater than the son I mean and so this this theme of accessibility  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5126" display="01:25:26" %}} - so I don't mean to cut in too much but the theme of accessibility carries into christophanies into the Old Testament so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5132" display="01:25:32" %}} - when we think of Moses speaking to the burning bush of Abraham having a conversation with God they're talking to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5140" display="01:25:40" %}} - the you person second person in the Trinity right the one who is accessible who is representing them to the father's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5147" display="01:25:47" %}} - Authority um yes yes indeed so that that that is um that is the point there okay so the point the the main thing I I was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5161" display="01:26:01" %}} - trying to address is um it's it's almost as if the Trinity just doesn't seem to care whether you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5172" display="01:26:12" %}} - think that um because the son acts in subordination to the father and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5180" display="01:26:20" %}} - spirit acts as at the behest of the father and the son that somehow the son is therefore less than  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5188" display="01:26:28" %}} - the father in his deity or that the spirit is less than the father and the son in his deity it's not that they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5195" display="01:26:35" %}} - don't care about the truth involved in this it's more that just as we saw um in what Jesus said to his Apostles and what  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5203" display="01:26:43" %}} - we see in Phil in Philippians chapter 2 the dynamic in the Trinity is a dynamic of love it's not one of jealousy you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5212" display="01:26:52" %}} - don't see them basically struggling to to to establish themselves as something they seem to be just very  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5221" display="01:27:01" %}} - comfortable in what they are such that if you don't accept them to be what they are that's that's to your own detriment  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5228" display="01:27:08" %}} - it doesn't affect them in any way so but the scriptures do make it clear to us that the father is God holy and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5238" display="01:27:18" %}} - completely God but so is the Son and so is the spirit so the the the way we are supposed to take things then is if he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5247" display="01:27:27" %}} - the son it's not because he is less God he is less powerful he's less anything he was eternally generated and so on and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5254" display="01:27:34" %}} - so forth It's that he elected it to to accept a position of subservience it really is subservience a position of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5263" display="01:27:43" %}} - being less than the father but not because he is less in his nature or character but less in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5270" display="01:27:50" %}} - function than the father so he serves at the father's behalf and in John chapter I believe it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5277" display="01:27:57" %}} - chapter 14 to where Jesus was talking about sending the spirit he said that the spirit would take from what is his  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5286" display="01:28:06" %}} - to show it to the church so there it may the the the way he spoke of the spirit there could suggest someone give someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5294" display="01:28:14" %}} - the idea that the spirit is somehow less than the Sun but it does not mean that the spirit is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5302" display="01:28:22" %}} - less in in nature of or character than the son what he is is less in function because that is what he chose and he did  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5311" display="01:28:31" %}} - not and and then again as Professor Robert would say that there is no these are not hard and fast demarcations  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5318" display="01:28:38" %}} - between the members of the Trinity there there's a lot of overlap in these functions that we talked about in a lot  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5324" display="01:28:44" %}} - of ways the person that the Bible gives to us as the father is he's very like the son in in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5333" display="01:28:53" %}} - the same function in there are things that he does that you would have attributed to the to the son that it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5339" display="01:28:59" %}} - actually the father who does same thing with the spirit so there's a lot of overlap it's not hard and fast but the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5346" display="01:29:06" %}} - way the Bible presents these things to us is sort of to tell us all three of them are involved in this Plan of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5354" display="01:29:14" %}} - Redemption this plan of creation Redemption and the um uh confirmation of the family of God in eternity there each  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5364" display="01:29:24" %}} - each member of the Trinity um and and the the collective Trinity is fully invested in realizing what God planned  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5375" display="01:29:35" %}} - from eternity past so that's that's the takeaway that we should have than getting all caught up in the whole  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5383" display="01:29:43" %}} - business of who is greater than who another point to make perhaps this will help by way of other examples when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5390" display="01:29:50" %}} - think of Pastor teachers um even Apostles among the church are they greater than other human beings  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5397" display="01:29:57" %}} - I mean it kind of depends what one means by this right are they greater humans you are they just better inherently well  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5405" display="01:30:05" %}} - not not really they have a different job however that job of theirs does grant them authority over others right but are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5414" display="01:30:14" %}} - they better inherently well not really it's the role you see not the person right and if we are able to disentangle  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5423" display="01:30:23" %}} - that for human beings well it's the same thing for the members of the Trinity right how about men and women in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5430" display="01:30:30" %}} - marriage now unfortunately there's been a group of people throughout history that has done violence to the proper  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5437" display="01:30:37" %}} - interpretation men and women are spiritually equal um there's a verse in Galatians says neither slave nor free um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5445" display="01:30:45" %}} - nor man nor woman nor Greek nor Jew nor Greek right um you know basically all of these things don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5452" display="01:30:52" %}} - divide us in Christ Jesus right women are in no way spiritually like lesser than men um that is false  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5461" display="01:31:01" %}} - doctrine that is heresy that is something that we should fight against tooth and nail because it's very  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5466" display="01:31:06" %}} - spiritually damaging but within marriage the Bible is nonetheless very clear that men are the head of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5473" display="01:31:13" %}} - households that is where the authority is but again that is a role are men better than women well no but do men  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5484" display="01:31:24" %}} - have authority in the household well yes you see what we're saying right so just as men in marriage just as teachers  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5492" display="01:31:32" %}} - within the church just as the father in The Trinity right um that's all there is to it um it doesn't mean that in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5501" display="01:31:41" %}} - marriage and in the church that those people those human beings are better than other human beings and so too when  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5508" display="01:31:48" %}} - we talk about the members of the Trinity it has nothing to do with greatness it has to do with delegated authority  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5515" display="01:31:55" %}} - within the roles that they fill um yeah yeah I did went this is a little bit Ah head skipping in the study but almost  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5525" display="01:32:05" %}} - word for word what you said Audi um as Dr lugan bille saying the same thing it is of labor but it is not strict man in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5533" display="01:32:13" %}} - most of these and other joint actions of the Trinity there is overlap and further subdivision of responsibilities which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5539" display="01:32:19" %}} - often only hinted at in scripture right overlap and further subdivis Vision um we are talking about things to help us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5548" display="01:32:28" %}} - understand and contextualize the function of the roles in the Trinity right um yeah and so you know how we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5554" display="01:32:34" %}} - gone on before about if you have a parable and you try to push it past what you should you run into problems yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5561" display="01:32:41" %}} - yeah kind of the same thing here right and we've talked about this before uh specifically we keep harping on all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5567" display="01:32:47" %}} - those people who get all bent out of shape about the Eternal generation of the Sun and things like that right they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5573" display="01:32:53" %}} - have in the same way that people who who reason about analogies and Parables have gone off the rails that too is pushing  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5581" display="01:33:01" %}} - this it is a metaphor it is not literal right um although the human part of Jesus was literally begotten by God that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5589" display="01:33:09" %}} - part is literal but I mean generally speaking what we are talking about in the roles is a metaphor to help us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5595" display="01:33:15" %}} - understand um yeah all right well maybe we'll pause see if folks have any questions here right  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5607" display="01:33:27" %}} - so now we're going to talk about the role of the holy spirit in the Trinity so the third person of the Trinity and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5614" display="01:33:34" %}} - just as with the other two roles we're going to be going kind of in order here first talking about the origin then the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5620" display="01:33:40" %}} - significance and then the person um of this role or this person in the Trinity so uh previously when we've been talking  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5630" display="01:33:50" %}} - about the origin of the father uh we we mentioned uh kind of how this idea of fatherhood comes up so there's this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5637" display="01:33:57" %}} - passage in Hebrews chapter 12 that talks about God disciplining us as human fathers we made this point that uh God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5644" display="01:34:04" %}} - is basically like fathers except better in every way so our human fathers may be imperfect but God is like that except  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5652" display="01:34:12" %}} - ever to a more perfect degree and we made the point that it's the human that copies the Divine not the other way  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5659" display="01:34:19" %}} - around that's how typology works so too with the sun um we had all of these comparisons with uh basically where  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5666" display="01:34:26" %}} - we're getting this idea of sunship from the Bible Well the spirit is actually perhaps uh even more straightforward as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5673" display="01:34:33" %}} - to where we get it uh because the words for Spirit in both Greek and Hebrew mean breath or wind as well um so this idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5684" display="01:34:44" %}} - of some unseen force is just right there in the Greek and Hebrew and so uh the Greek and Hebrew words for Spirit you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5692" display="01:34:52" %}} - know this is straight from ichus ruak is the uh is the Hebrew word and Numa is the Greek word here and both of these as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5700" display="01:35:00" %}} - I say have that meaning of wind or Breeze as well as meaning spirit so when we say holy spirit in English and we get  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5709" display="01:35:09" %}} - this idea of uh some form of force or some form of uh presence that has this unseen effect this restraining effect as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5720" display="01:35:20" %}} - we'll talk about in in a second here it's just kind of right there in the words um and so we don't even have to uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5727" display="01:35:27" %}} - I don't know go find specific uh you know maybe kind of this typology like we were talking about with the sun um all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5733" display="01:35:33" %}} - of these things throughout the Bible that point us towards that idea of sunship well the idea of spirit is kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5739" display="01:35:39" %}} - of right there in the title um I mean I guess obviously sun is as well but the spirit's a little bit more obvious in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5746" display="01:35:46" %}} - this way um now just to emphasize up front here and we'll talk about this in a little bit more just because the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5753" display="01:35:53" %}} - Spirit has this sense of being unseen he's this Force that's working behind the scenes to restrain evil and Empower  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5760" display="01:36:00" %}} - good and you know uh indwell us connect us to the father and the son have perfect Unity with God that doesn't mean  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5768" display="01:36:08" %}} - that he is impersonal that he is somehow just like a force of Nature and doesn't have a will or personality um we've kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5777" display="01:36:17" %}} - of already been over this but it's just we have to emphasize that that even though he is the Unseen member of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5782" display="01:36:22" %}} - Trinity for us that does not mean that he is not a person um that he doesn't for example intercede for us with  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5790" display="01:36:30" %}} - groanings too deep for Words forget exactly which passage that is we've already read that but the spirit is a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5796" display="01:36:36" %}} - person and so we just need to not forget that um it's maybe easy for us to view him somewhat more impersonally because  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5804" display="01:36:44" %}} - he has these effects without being someone that we address uh like when we pray to the father we kind of pray  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5812" display="01:36:52" %}} - through Jesus Christ chist we made this big deal out of how Jesus sort of serves as the Crown Prince if you will the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5820" display="01:37:00" %}} - who gives us access to the throne room of the father well Jesus is the one uh kind of that we had face-to-face access  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5827" display="01:37:07" %}} - with the father is the one that we address our prayers to as the representation of deity the one with  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5833" display="01:37:13" %}} - authority but we kind of don't have that same impact with the spirit but the spirit is the one who helps us pray to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5841" display="01:37:21" %}} - the father and the son and so so the idea behind this is that even though the spirit's unseen he is not somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5849" display="01:37:29" %}} - impersonal um maybe in the sense that you would think of I don't know maybe more Eastern conceptions of some force  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5856" display="01:37:36" %}} - of nature or fate or what have you um uh this holy spirit is a person and again that is rolling back to the definition  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5864" display="01:37:44" %}} - of the Trinity that we've been going over of three persons one Essence well the spirit is one of the three persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5871" display="01:37:51" %}} - um all right so that's kind of where we get this idea of spirit of wind of breath from is that it's right there in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5879" display="01:37:59" %}} - the words that are used in the title in both the Greek and the Hebrew and again just to note it's actually quite  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5886" display="01:38:06" %}} - noteworthy that this same um what I would say the same set of meanings is actually present for the words in both  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5894" display="01:38:14" %}} - languages that is not very typical actually um a lot of the time if you have a word that can mean kind of two  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5900" display="01:38:20" %}} - things you know different separate meanings very often those connotative factors will differ across languages um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5908" display="01:38:28" %}} - but for this specific word it's actually there in both Greek and Hebrew which is quite noteworthy so that's kind of where  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5914" display="01:38:34" %}} - we get the idea of spirit from and as to the significance of this well just compare the idea of physical wind in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5922" display="01:38:42" %}} - world so the wind is a potent invisible force though we perceive it and experience its effects we can neither  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5928" display="01:38:48" %}} - see where it has come from or where it is going to we have this uh basically a verse reference here from John chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5936" display="01:38:56" %}} - 3:8 um well so too is that true of everyone who's born from the spirit um you might also compare I think somewhere  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5943" display="01:39:03" %}} - in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 maybe Verse 18 don't quote me on that reference um Paul mentions how basically spiritual  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5951" display="01:39:11" %}} - things seem like foolishness to those who do not see with eyes of Faith well so at any rate the wind as this potent  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5958" display="01:39:18" %}} - invisible force um now of course nowadays uh with with science and and instruments that help us measure such  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5965" display="01:39:25" %}} - things like barometric pressure we have a better understanding of wind patterns you know on the surface of the Earth if  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5971" display="01:39:31" %}} - you will however the main point is is that for us in the metaphor here by analogy we experience the effects of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5980" display="01:39:40" %}} - wind's presence without really being able to trace it at least not with the naked human eye and so the effects that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5988" display="01:39:48" %}} - we experience can be anything from sort of a gentle warming influence you know you might might compare a day with good  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="5995" display="01:39:55" %}} - weather out in the sunshine having a gentle breeze on your face uh to something uh like a powerful chilling  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6002" display="01:40:02" %}} - wind maybe in a storm something that would give you hypothermia lose body heat very quickly and so uh variety of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6010" display="01:40:10" %}} - effects that's something to emphasize here it's not all just one thing um and we'll get to that a bit when we talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6015" display="01:40:15" %}} - about the spirit's role here um but wind and again that is the same word that we're using for Spirit in the Greek and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6022" display="01:40:22" %}} - the Hebrew is very descriptive as an analogy for the holy spirit's role in the plan of God his invisible yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6030" display="01:40:30" %}} - powerful support for good um we have a couple verse references here um this one from Zechariah Chapter 4 uh verse 6 not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6039" display="01:40:39" %}} - by might nor by power but by my spirit says the Lord right and this is zarab Babble building in this book in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6046" display="01:40:46" %}} - Zechariah and then we have 1 Corinthians chapter 12 here talking about uh how the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6053" display="01:40:53" %}} - will basically he's the one who enables us to have faith I'm paraphrasing a bit but um no one can say Jesus is Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6061" display="01:41:01" %}} - except by the Holy Spirit um and then he also restrains evil so we have this this passage here in second Thessalonians  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6070" display="01:41:10" %}} - chapter 2 um this is talking about uh it's prophetic um it's talking about the Restraint of the Holy Spirit when it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6077" display="01:41:17" %}} - gets removed in the end times um the mystery of lawlessness um well once the spirit is removed uh the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6086" display="01:41:26" %}} - lawlessness of the world um this Restraint of evil when it is taken away the world will go will go wild it will  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6093" display="01:41:33" %}} - go crazy in a way that the spirit has thus far been restraining so this is passage in second Thessalonians chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6100" display="01:41:40" %}} - 2 veres 5 and following um also uh you know uh I'm not going to go through all the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6108" display="01:41:48" %}} - references here but the point is Spirit restrains evil um we actually have the same verse from from second Corinth or 1  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6114" display="01:41:54" %}} - Corinthians chapter 12 um talking about how well we can only confess Jesus as Lord through the power of the spirit but  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6121" display="01:42:01" %}} - also when people reject him um that uh basically the spirit is the one who controls our I don't me think about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6131" display="01:42:11" %}} - to phrase this um the spirit is the one who restrains um evil among people who don't confess but also is the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6139" display="01:42:19" %}} - through whom we can confess our belief um so um again just to summarize the significance of this of this analogy of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6147" display="01:42:27" %}} - this metaphor for the role of the spirit is a potent force that is not seen by us it has these effects on um basically  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6157" display="01:42:37" %}} - supporting good and restraining evil both in us uh you know like the fight between the spirit and the flesh you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6164" display="01:42:44" %}} - might compare uh Galatians chapter 5 where we know that the Flesh and the spirit are in conflict with one another  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6171" display="01:42:51" %}} - but also in the world more generally um both supporting good and restraining evil now in terms of the person we say  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6180" display="01:43:00" %}} - that the spirit is the third person of the Trinity so we talked about uh already the father is the first person  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6187" display="01:43:07" %}} - and the son is the second person and when we think in terms of grammar the first person um as the father when he  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6193" display="01:43:13" %}} - decrees things he uses this eye language um you know like uh my decrees stand firm for all time and it will go as I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6202" display="01:43:22" %}} - have planned it things like that um the authoritative uh the one who speaks forth his decrees we've talked about how  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6209" display="01:43:29" %}} - the son is sort of the second person the one whom we access the one who we address we talk to as one of us face to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6217" display="01:43:37" %}} - face and the spirit is the third person who we don't address and who doesn't address us but he is there nonetheless  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6225" display="01:43:45" %}} - working out God's plan in the world so again unlike the father he does not speak directly to us and unlike the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6234" display="01:43:54" %}} - he has not been made manifest to us you know taking on human flesh being born into the world in the Incarnation but  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6241" display="01:44:01" %}} - instead just like the wind the spirit is unseen by us but also just like the wind that doesn't mean that we don't  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6248" display="01:44:08" %}} - experience his power that we can't feel the effects of his ministry and just to emphasize again the spirit is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6257" display="01:44:17" %}} - impersonal he is a person he is one of the three members of the godhead in the Trinity and so when we say that we feel  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6266" display="01:44:26" %}} - his effects it's not in the same way um that we have these laws of nature if you will or or things that aren't personal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6275" display="01:44:35" %}} - um so um we talked about this passage before where um the spirit I should have pulled this up beforehand um Audie do  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6283" display="01:44:43" %}} - you know off the top of your head um the passage where in the New Testament the spirit is is said to be the one Speaking  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6290" display="01:44:50" %}} - um I think this is Ephesians is it Ephesians or Hebrews it's in Hebrews chapter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6297" display="01:44:57" %}} - 4 Hebrews 4 I know it's quoting an Old Testament scripture um can you hear me yeah I can hear you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6307" display="01:45:07" %}} - okay it's in Hebrews chapter 3 Hebrews chapter 3 yes right here um the Holy Spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6315" display="01:45:15" %}} - speaks here right um so I'm sorry I should have pulled that reference up before but this is the point the Holy  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6322" display="01:45:22" %}} - Spirit despite being this force that is largely unseen by us he is still a personal member of the godhead um he's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6330" display="01:45:30" %}} - still speaks and this also gets to one of those other points that we've talked about before that the roles are not uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6339" display="01:45:39" %}} - let me think about the right way to put this they there are somewhat blurry lines of distinction between them right  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6346" display="01:45:46" %}} - um it is not uh as certain groups suppose something that is like forced by Nature upon the members of God it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6354" display="01:45:54" %}} - something that they have elected to adopt in uh a way in which we humans might understand them um so um I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6364" display="01:46:04" %}} - that's that's uh about what we have to say about this um so to wrap up what we've gone over here for this third  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6372" display="01:46:12" %}} - person we've talked about where it comes from in the words um the significance of this analogy of viewing it like wind and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6379" display="01:46:19" %}} - then also how uh despite the fact that the spirit is UN seen he still has these effects in the world but he's also still  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6386" display="01:46:26" %}} - a person AI do you have anything to Riff on here maybe especially given this this quotation we just pulled up about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6395" display="01:46:35" %}} - spirit speaking and um tring to think about other one where it says he intercedes for us he intercedes for us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6404" display="01:46:44" %}} - should be Romans chapter eight yes yes right before yeah Roman that's right before the um you know the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6412" display="01:46:52" %}} - the whole chain of forn predestined Justified glorified sort of thing so not much um except just as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6422" display="01:47:02" %}} - these things you've pointed out the note it's not that we're strictly saying he doesn't speak to us he doesn't you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6428" display="01:47:08" %}} - interact with us and all that it's just that the role he plays in the Trinity um largely places him in a and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6437" display="01:47:17" %}} - we've talked about these roles overlapping in some ways you know so we know that calls Jesus our inter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6443" display="01:47:23" %}} - even though that's more the spirit's role you know so we have things like that happening um in the scriptures uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6452" display="01:47:32" %}} - so I think I think that the dis the discourse so far it should make sense as to why there is often that difficulty  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6461" display="01:47:41" %}} - with making sense of how um the spirit is the spirit for those who start to think that um uh the the spirit of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6473" display="01:47:53" %}} - uh is is somehow the animating force that makes the husk that is the father you know work or something like that if  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6482" display="01:48:02" %}} - God the father is the body and spirit somehow isting principle that's not how any of this works he's called the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6490" display="01:48:10" %}} - because of the role he plays that he is more in the background even though he is his effects are very very obvious and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6499" display="01:48:19" %}} - undeniable as you have said he is the one one that is restraining evil in the world he's also the one empowering  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6506" display="01:48:26" %}} - everything that is good everything that pleases God in the world so but he is not in the foreground he is not in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6514" display="01:48:34" %}} - for he's not the one we we run into so to speak I think it's really interesting to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6521" display="01:48:41" %}} - consider you may see this come up as a theme in literature some this idea of the individual versus the collective the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6528" display="01:48:48" %}} - spirit the role that he plays is actually present in both angles and I was somewhat inelegant getting the point  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6535" display="01:48:55" %}} - across um just because I don't know why I was having a hard time phrasing it but this idea of the spirit allowing us you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6542" display="01:49:02" %}} - know the he's the one through whom we are able to confess Jesus Christ right um and this idea of in the personal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6550" display="01:49:10" %}} - individual sense um what we do uh gate kept isn't quite the right word but we are empowered by the spirit as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6558" display="01:49:18" %}} - individuals um it's kind of he's the one through whom we are connected to God he's the one who indwells us when we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6564" display="01:49:24" %}} - believe all of that's at the individual level but we also talked about how the spirit empowers good and restraints evil  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6570" display="01:49:30" %}} - in the world as a collective right so this idea of individual versus Collective or you know the world more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6577" display="01:49:37" %}} - properly not the individual um the spirit is present at both macro levels if you will um and his effects are seen  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6585" display="01:49:45" %}} - in both places um and so I think that can be helpful for us understanding his role a bit better is that it's not just  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6593" display="01:49:53" %}} - you know in an individual's life this is true on the global scale as well as this passage in second Thessalonians mentions  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6601" display="01:50:01" %}} - when the Restraint of the spirit is removed then we'll really see how he's been restraining things across the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6609" display="01:50:09" %}} - world I think that's that's about that all right so the thing that we're going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6618" display="01:50:18" %}} - close with here in this examination of the Trinity rules is going to be mostly discussing how uh these analogies that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6626" display="01:50:26" %}} - we've spoken of for the persons of the Trinity for these roles the idea of the fatherhood of the Father the sonh of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6634" display="01:50:34" %}} - Son and the spirits uh invisible empowering and restraining force in the world well how these things are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6642" display="01:50:42" %}} - analogies and we don't get to push the analogies to describe reality other than by analogy I mean it sort of seems like  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6650" display="01:50:50" %}} - a maybe a really obvious point to to make but it's actually critically important because a lot of heresy in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6656" display="01:50:56" %}} - past has been because people don't appreciate this point um and so maybe that'll be more clear in a second here  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6663" display="01:51:03" %}} - so these things are representative of the individual roles in the plan of God for mankind and the analogies have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6671" display="01:51:11" %}} - given to help us understand the relationships and the functions of the three Divine Personalities in that plan  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6676" display="01:51:16" %}} - so how they relate to each other so to speak but we should not push the names of the roles past what they are intended  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6685" display="01:51:25" %}} - to be in the Bible which is analogies to our human frame of reference as in these are for us they are not clinical  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6694" display="01:51:34" %}} - descriptions of how God works so to speak so much as they are ways for us to better understand him and so um if you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6703" display="01:51:43" %}} - have studied the nature of God at all You' probably come across the words anthropomorphism and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6710" display="01:51:50" %}} - anthropopathism and these are long technical jargony terms for describing how sometimes we ascribe things to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6719" display="01:51:59" %}} - to make him kind of like humans in form right um and actually I think maybe we don't maybe we don't anthropomorphize  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6727" display="01:52:07" %}} - God so much as we anthropopathy him anthropomorphism was I think more common that's like I don't know uh viewing  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6733" display="01:52:13" %}} - animals as more like humans in form path is and deals with this idea of emotion so a good example is God's anger well in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6741" display="01:52:21" %}} - any case just take a step back when we do this we are making God sort of fundamentally something he's not to help  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6749" display="01:52:29" %}} - us better understand him now this isn't like I don't know this is some sort of terrible practice because the Bible uses  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6755" display="01:52:35" %}} - this right when we anthropomorphize god um we are saying he is a father well God is not a father in the same sense that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6763" display="01:52:43" %}} - you or I have a human father but he is still Our Father why because in the same way that human fathers for example  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6771" display="01:52:51" %}} - discipline us and are the authority figure in our lives that we need to respect and submit to and things like  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6777" display="01:52:57" %}} - that well God is like that right and that's why it's a helpful way to help us understand him same deal with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6783" display="01:53:03" %}} - sunship of God and the Unseen effects of the Holy Spirit again these things are analogies for our benefit but the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6791" display="01:53:11" %}} - problem here is when people take this and then they say that well because Jesus is the son of God that therefore  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6799" display="01:53:19" %}} - somehow it has to be true in what I would call the real objective ontological sense that the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6805" display="01:53:25" %}} - somehow originated the son that the son is created and hopefully you see right away that that is a problem that's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6813" display="01:53:33" %}} - very different thing we've already emphasized in our study here that all three members of the Trinity share in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6820" display="01:53:40" %}} - the same Essence they are all co-equal and co-eternal and consubstantial but they can't be co-eternal if one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6827" display="01:53:47" %}} - originates the other right now it is true that the human nature of Jesus Christ  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6833" display="01:53:53" %}} - was begotten we might say you know that is the word that you'll hear come up here but that is his human nature and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6839" display="01:53:59" %}} - his human nature only the Divine person of the Son of God is Not generated from the father and you can see where people  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6847" display="01:54:07" %}} - get it because in human terms Sons come from their fathers right well and their mothers you know um but the point is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6855" display="01:54:15" %}} - that's not descriptive of how the members of the Trinity relate to each other that is pushing the analogy too  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6862" display="01:54:22" %}} - far and so many heresies in the past you know many of them stumble on this point they say well the Bible speaks of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6871" display="01:54:31" %}} - the father and God the son therefore somehow the son must come from the father but in fact the son is co-equal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6877" display="01:54:37" %}} - co-eternal consubstantial with the father he cannot be originated from him it's simply not true that is pushing the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6884" display="01:54:44" %}} - analogy too far um and so this the true of the spirit as well sometimes people will subordinate either the son or the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6890" display="01:54:50" %}} - spirit as kind of being lesser than the father in some way maybe proceeding from him that is the language you'll hear of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6897" display="01:54:57" %}} - the spirit these things are not true they are pushing the analogies further than is permissible and so that's kind  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6904" display="01:55:04" %}} - of the point that we're making here fundamentally is that these things are just analogies they are nothing more and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6910" display="01:55:10" %}} - nothing less and they are supposed to help us understand God and they are good and godly and we should use them because  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6916" display="01:55:16" %}} - the Bible does and they're for our benefit but they are not supposed to tell us exactly like the scientific  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6924" display="01:55:24" %}} - accounting of things so to speak and trying to take them that way is incorrect you are trying to take the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6930" display="01:55:30" %}} - text in a way that it was not meant to be taken um so you might hear things such as this the the Bible is not meant  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6937" display="01:55:37" %}} - to be a science textbook right people will say this about uh the Book of Genesis it is true to a degree but the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6943" display="01:55:43" %}} - point is when we interpret things we need to understand what their purpose is what their point is doesn't mean that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6949" display="01:55:49" %}} - can make the Bible mean whatever we want it to mean but it does mean that we need to read it as it was meant to be read so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6955" display="01:55:55" %}} - to speak um all right so one other thing and I've already emphasized this the spirit is not impersonal right he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6963" display="01:56:03" %}} - invisible and largely unseen as an agent here in a way that the son was not so for example christophanies in the Old  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6970" display="01:56:10" %}} - Testament and obviously Jesus being physically Among Us however he does act in a very personal way towards us and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6977" display="01:56:17" %}} - towards the other members of the Trinity um so there's a lot of vers references here um I would encourage people who are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6984" display="01:56:24" %}} - interested to go look these up these are coming from the study I didn't make these um but the spirit is our comforter  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6990" display="01:56:30" %}} - and our encourager those things are something done individual to individual right person to person we would say um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="6999" display="01:56:39" %}} - leadership encouragement and empowerment these are personal uh what we might say actions of the spirit um personal and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7009" display="01:56:49" %}} - animating you know he's not just a force and so this is another way in which people take the analogy and then they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7018" display="01:56:58" %}} - try to over apply it they say well you see the word for spirit is wind therefore just like the wind is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7024" display="01:57:04" %}} - impersonal because it is the wind is not literally a person if we do make the wind a person we personify you know you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7031" display="01:57:11" %}} - might hear like I don't know Father Christmas or something right or Dawn as for example a woman with a trailing gown  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7040" display="01:57:20" %}} - or trailing cloak or something right that we're personifying inanimate things well the spirit isn't like that he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7048" display="01:57:28" %}} - like the wind in that the effects of his role as he plays out in God's plan in the world are largely unseen but that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7055" display="01:57:35" %}} - doesn't mean that he isn't a person and so these are just but two cases here of people taking the analogy and then going  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7065" display="01:57:45" %}} - further with it than we should um and so again the analogies are just analogies and nothing more but they do help us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7072" display="01:57:52" %}} - better understand the roles of the trinity in the plan of God and that's why they're there in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7078" display="01:57:58" %}} - Bible Audie you have any thoughts on any of this stuff that we've gone over here not much just a reiteration of what we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7087" display="01:58:07" %}} - said earlier of what I said earlier which you have essentially repeated which  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7092" display="01:58:12" %}} - is uh represent what the roles are supposed to be or what the rules are they don't really tell  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7099" display="01:58:19" %}} - us for example most people get uh really interested in the identities of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7107" display="01:58:27" %}} - different uh angels in the scriptures the names the names the spirit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7115" display="01:58:35" %}} - the what we want to know about the godhead but they do tell us what we need to know which is how each member of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7124" display="01:58:44" %}} - Trinity is involved in this business that really concerns us in such to such a great  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7135" display="01:58:55" %}} - extent we are part of something really big really Eternal and we are learning just how involved God is with it um that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7146" display="01:59:06" %}} - again like you said that he is Spirit does not mean that he is impersonal it also does not mean that um he is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7154" display="01:59:14" %}} - thing that is really alive and the rest of the godhead is more like I don't know husks or something of that s all of this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7163" display="01:59:23" %}} - is simply speaking to the functions the roles that they play so um I'm I'm not sure there is much more to add to all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7173" display="01:59:33" %}} - that if anyone at this point honestly I feel more and more as if if anyone stumbles over these things they really  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7180" display="01:59:40" %}} - really want to stumble over them it's in many studies now we have discussed pretty much the same thing over and over  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7188" display="01:59:48" %}} - again which is that whenever we come across analogies whenever we come across these names were not supposed to think  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7195" display="01:59:55" %}} - of them as if we're thinking about human beings or creatures of any kind we're talking about God he's a fundamentally  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7203" display="02:00:03" %}} - different sort of existence from the universe he's not like us we were our our creation was based on what he is but  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7214" display="02:00:14" %}} - that does not mean that he is like us we are if you will a poor imitation of what he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7223" display="02:00:23" %}} - should tell us that whenever we are trying to make sense of him we don't use ourselves I love the way that someone  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7228" display="02:00:28" %}} - actually put it several months ago on clubhouse he said that you don't do theology from  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7234" display="02:00:34" %}} - anthropology so you you leave man as man and treat God as God a lot of things that about God that we understand are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7244" display="02:00:44" %}} - made understandable To Us by relating God to us through our experience in other words it's like you know what a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7251" display="02:00:51" %}} - father is yes God is something like that you know what the spirit is right yeah well the spirit is something like that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7259" display="02:00:59" %}} - but that does not mean that you know the spirit is that and and God is that there are differences between what God is and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7267" display="02:01:07" %}} - what we are even though in in a lot of ways if we understand what we are we get a good understanding of what God is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7276" display="02:01:16" %}} - that's yep yep and just I to Riff on what you've said said here it really should be obvious to us that's something  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7285" display="02:01:25" %}} - that I think it perhaps Bears repeating given that a lot of people seem to not find this obvious or they argue it's not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7292" display="02:01:32" %}} - obvious and I don't know how to say it in a a perhaps a diplomatic way other than it's just they're they're wrong and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7300" display="02:01:40" %}} - this is not hard is what we should say and we shouldn't equivocate on this um the things that we're talking about it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7307" display="02:01:47" %}} - doesn't matter that people have argued about them long and philosophical for hundreds of years in church history well  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7313" display="02:01:53" %}} - so what because these things are pretty clear from scripture and this idea that we're talking about about analogies just  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7320" display="02:02:00" %}} - being analogies it's pretty Central to the discipline that we typically call hermeneutics this idea of interpretation  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7327" display="02:02:07" %}} - of the Bible this is not like so to speak an 8,000 level course in hermeneutics it's one of the very first  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7334" display="02:02:14" %}} - starting ones right you have to read the Bible as it was meant to be read right and part of that is you don't push  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7340" display="02:02:20" %}} - analogies further than they should um so that's just to say what AI has said here about this idea of people who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7347" display="02:02:27" %}} - stumble over this they kind of have to want to because you have to twist things to take it in the the ways that that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7356" display="02:02:36" %}} - are arguing are incorrect um you have to be pushing something that basically you're making this assumption that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7362" display="02:02:42" %}} - text doesn't make itself um so uh with that that's where we'll close out this and uh um in the next lesson we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7371" display="02:02:51" %}} - going to be talking about uh how the roles show up in the New Testament more directly so we'll be reading more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7381" display="02:03:01" %}} - scripture so that's where we're going to end this lesson here talking about the roles in the Trinity so kind of an  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7387" display="02:03:07" %}} - overview of the three roles as we find them in the godhead and so we kind of started out uh talking about how the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7396" display="02:03:16" %}} - roles in the Trinity um are kind of there to help us give perspective on how God works um so a Biblical way we would  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7404" display="02:03:24" %}} - say right as opposed to some ofat the illustrations that we've gone over previously that fail to capture that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7410" display="02:03:30" %}} - idea of three persons one Essence uh kind of in a way that doesn't mislead us and so um God has been uh for all time  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7420" display="02:03:40" %}} - relating to us in his Redemptive purpose towards mankind so saving us from our sin redeeming us um From Slavery to sin  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7429" display="02:03:49" %}} - reconciling us with himself in uh making us Sons and Daughters we have the inheritance of God With Jesus Christ as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7435" display="02:03:55" %}} - our elder brother the first fruits and the resurrection all of this stuff he's been doing this um and these roles that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7441" display="02:04:01" %}} - he's adopted as he relates to us um we've already talked about how all three members of the Trinity are involved in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7448" display="02:04:08" %}} - all of these processes so all of that all of those jargony terms like Redemption and justification and all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7455" display="02:04:15" %}} - that sort of things all three members of the Trinity are part of it we talked about uh shared names of the Trinity so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7462" display="02:04:22" %}} - Elohim in the Old Testament and as well as the tetragrammaton the proper name of God I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7469" display="02:04:29" %}} - am who I am uh he who was and is and is to come we talked about the individual names for the Trinity and the roles that

{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7484" display="02:04:44" %}} - accessible person the one who took on flesh that we can talk to as our older brother uh in the faith as the one who  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7492" display="02:04:52" %}} - intercedes for us before the father sort of just in the same way that uh people might go to the Crown Prince rather than  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7499" display="02:04:59" %}} - the authoritative King on the throne because he's more accessible and then we talked about the Holy Spirit as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1Gla5UuJqt8" time="7506" display="02:05:06" %}} - Unseen yet powerful force that empowers good and restrains evil both in us as individuals and in the world as a whole
