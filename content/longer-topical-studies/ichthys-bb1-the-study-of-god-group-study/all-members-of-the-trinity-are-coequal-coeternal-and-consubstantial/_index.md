## Summary {#summary}

This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that there is any inferiority or disparity of status, activity, or substance between the members of the Trinity.

{{< /subjects >}}

In any human association, there is always inherent inferiority and disparity present---in practice, if not perhaps on paper. People are separate beings, and these are the simple consequences of that. However, this is not the case for God; the Trinity shares completely perfect unity and equality.

God is *one* in essence and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are coequal, coeternal, and con-substantial partners in one and the same essence. Heresies of the past which have challenged the coequality of members of the Trinity include subordinationism (which alternatively asserts that either Christ or the Spirit is by nature inferior to the Father) and Arianism (which teaches a Christ not entirely equal in divinity to the Father). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are coequal partakers of the same essence.

Then Jesus came over and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me, so go and make all nations my followers by baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and by teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you."

As seen from the attribution of goodness to all three members in the apostolic benediction of 2 Corinthians, where grace (the policy of the goodness of God), love (the natural consequence---or "emanation"---of the goodness of God), and fellowship (the ultimate result of the goodness of God) are respectively attributed to the Son, the Father, and the Holy Spirit:

May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God [the Father], and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

## Video/audio transcript {#video-audio-transcript}

{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="0" display="00:00" %}} - all right guys so this lesson we are going to be talking about how all members of the Trinity are co-equal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="7" display="00:07" %}} - co-eternal and consubstantial and so in other lessons we have talked for example about how the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="15" display="00:15" %}} - three persons in the Trinity are distinct persons um so uh the father is not the same person as the son is not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="23" display="00:23" %}} - the same person as the spirit and having established that what we're going to be talking about now is primarily that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="29" display="00:29" %}} - there isn't any inferiority or disparity of status activity or substance between members of the Trinity so that is in so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="38" display="00:38" %}} - far as we have three persons in the Trinity there isn't any sense of uh what we might term inferiority between them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="47" display="00:47" %}} - and so we're going to be establishing this as we say through status activity and substance so uh kind of in that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="54" display="00:54" %}} - order we're going to be talking about how they all possess a full and equal share in the status of deity a full and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="60" display="01:00" %}} - equal share in the Eternal function of deity so that would be the activity and then a full and equal share in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="66" display="01:06" %}} - substance of deity and so we'll get into a little bit more what we mean by these things maybe they sound a little bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="72" display="01:12" %}} - abstract as we go through Point by point but first we'll be starting off talking about the general concept here that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="78" display="01:18" %}} - there isn't any inferiority or disparity between the three members of the Trinity so as we say starting out with  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="89" display="01:29" %}} - here the key point for this lesson is that even though God is three in person that does not mean that there is any  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="97" display="01:37" %}} - inferiority or disparity of status activity or substance between the members of the Trinity now just by way  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="104" display="01:44" %}} - of introduction and I believe we've raised this point before in our past oops in our past discussions um this is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="112" display="01:52" %}} - something that is very difficult for us as humans to understand because within Human Society human relationship ships  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="120" display="02:00" %}} - anytime you have two humans humans do not share the same Essence I think we talked about this a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="126" display="02:06" %}} - little bit humans are dichotomus made up of body or flesh and spirit and so whenever you have two humans in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="135" display="02:15" %}} - world they are inherently not United in the same way that God is um and they have what we would call disparity right  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="144" display="02:24" %}} - maybe they have peculiar strengths and weaknesses um you know they have their personal tendencies in the same way that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="150" display="02:30" %}} - we have three persons in the Trinity but unlike Human Relationships the Trinity does not have um any hint the slightest  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="158" display="02:38" %}} - hint of uh unequal relationships between the members um and as I say this is just sort of a hard concept for us as humans  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="167" display="02:47" %}} - to wrap our mind around because it's so very different from how we relate to each other um so I saying that that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="174" display="02:54" %}} - also what is here on the slide so I'll just go ahead and read this it says in any in human associations there's always  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="180" display="03:00" %}} - inferiority or disparity of status activity or substance always people are separate beings and these are the simple  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="187" display="03:07" %}} - consequences of that however this is not the case for the God because the Trinity shares completely perfect unity and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="194" display="03:14" %}} - equality um and so breaking that down a little bit more um as we will get uh more into next time so we've already  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="202" display="03:22" %}} - talked about the distinctness between the persons um and in the lesson after this one we'll be hitting this point  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="207" display="03:27" %}} - here about uh sharing the Essence more um but on account of sharing that Essence the three persons in the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="215" display="03:35" %}} - are co-equal co-eternal and consubstantial Partners um and what that means um obviously equality meaning they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="224" display="03:44" %}} - are all uh you know there is no inferiority between them um co-eternal they are all equally existent outside of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="231" display="03:51" %}} - time they share in the attributes in the nature and character of God that we kind of opened this study in uh uh part one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="240" display="04:00" %}} - of Bible basics going over theology in uh so that would be the infinite nature of God and the perfect character of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="247" display="04:07" %}} - and consubstantial sharing the same substance the same Essence which is what we will continue to go through all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="255" display="04:15" %}} - these three things um are true even despite the members of the Trinity being their own persons um so as we've gone  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="265" display="04:25" %}} - through um some of the other things in our progression here of explaining the trinity in terms of things that it is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="271" display="04:31" %}} - not we're also going to mention a couple heresies on this particular topic um specifically the notion of equality um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="280" display="04:40" %}} - heresies of the past which have challenged the co-ee equality of members of the Trinity include so-called  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="286" display="04:46" %}} - subordinationism uh which alternatively asserts that either Christ or the spirit is by nature inferior to the father so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="294" display="04:54" %}} - just so happens and uh most of these uh positions of false teaching or heresy that the person who is elevated is the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="302" display="05:02" %}} - father and the person who is uh reduced in status would be the son or the spirit now of course that none of these are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="308" display="05:08" %}} - true that just happens to be the consistent pattern of the false teaching and aryanism specifically came from a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="316" display="05:16" %}} - guy in history named Arias uh and aryanism teaches that Christ was not entirely equal in Divinity to the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="324" display="05:24" %}} - um so uh kind of depending how far you take that that's either he is Divine but somehow not equal um in status or he  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="333" display="05:33" %}} - simply isn't Divine at all um so he for example believing he was just a human being um but as I say these are the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="341" display="05:41" %}} - false positions and we are defining our understanding of the trinity in terms of what these are not so unlike these false  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="348" display="05:48" %}} - positions we believe that the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are co-equal partakers of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="354" display="05:54" %}} - same Essence that is there is no difference in status between the three persons of the Trinity so this is sort  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="362" display="06:02" %}} - of the point that we're setting out to discuss in this lesson here and uh kind of given that introduction Audi is there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="368" display="06:08" %}} - anything you want to say um as we get into this topic no I think you covered it pretty well all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="378" display="06:18" %}} - right so perhaps the easiest of these uh Notions to grasp is this idea of status and so as seen in the rank accorded to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="390" display="06:30" %}} - each in the formula for profession of Faith the point of spiritual baptism into the body of Christ it's kind of a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="395" display="06:35" %}} - mouthful but this is the Great Commission at the end of Matthew chapter 28 um that is when Jesus Is Telling um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="404" display="06:44" %}} - the disciples uh kind of how to baptize people into the body of Christ spiritually speaking um so in that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="411" display="06:51" %}} - profession here um which is very very clearly deal dealing with the concept of authority um that is um this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="420" display="07:00" %}} - uh it's the right way to say it it's not like a a magic incantation um but this formula through which uh baptism was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="429" display="07:09" %}} - rendered um and again we've emphasized continually that the preposition in these verses is into not in um so not in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="437" display="07:17" %}} - the name of but into the name of into the person of God that is the focus is on spiritual baptism into the body of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="444" display="07:24" %}} - Christ rather than uh merely being cleansed with water physically um well in this profession which turns very much  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="453" display="07:33" %}} - on Authority the father and the son and the spirit are given completely equal billing um and so that is basically uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="461" display="07:41" %}} - the purpose of including these verses at the end of Matthew chapter 28 is showing that when we uh are discussing the three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="470" display="07:50" %}} - members of the Trinity um here in context for the purpose of uh kind of like in the authority of of God um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="478" display="07:58" %}} - that's how we are saying we um are rendering a person uh United with the body of Christ you know it's not on our  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="486" display="08:06" %}} - own authority um but it is on the authority of God that we do this well all three members of the Trinity are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="493" display="08:13" %}} - spoken of as basically having equal status here um they are spoken of as having the authority uh by which this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="501" display="08:21" %}} - action is performed AI do you have anything you want to add to this yeah um not much really  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="510" display="08:30" %}} - um sorry um I think it's uh it's quite sufficient  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="517" display="08:37" %}} - to say like you said that uh the Matthew 28 verse um vers 19 to 20 uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="530" display="08:50" %}} - uh passage really does speak to um spiritual baptism we have Ephesians 4 I think verse two or three um guaranteeing  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="544" display="09:04" %}} - that because it essentially says there's one baptism only and uh we have to decide whether that is the baptism of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="550" display="09:10" %}} - water or it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Acts chapter one tells us through the words of the Lord Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="559" display="09:19" %}} - himself that um we are um although although John's baptism was the baptism of water his baptism was that of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="570" display="09:30" %}} - spirit um so we have multiple places in the Bible that tell us that the baptism that Jesus was speaking to had to be the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="580" display="09:40" %}} - baptism of the spirit and that's critical to understand Matthew 19 verse Matthew 28: 19 and 20 um if we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="590" display="09:50" %}} - appreciate that there is just one baptism and that that is what the Lord Jesus is speaking to then we will know  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="596" display="09:56" %}} - this is not um three of course this is hardly an issue I don't think I've ever heard anyone uh being confused about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="606" display="10:06" %}} - whether Jesus was saying were to have three separate baptisms obviously he was talking about one and he said it's it's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="614" display="10:14" %}} - in English in the name of the father and of the son and of the spirit I mean if we were to go with the English we' still  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="620" display="10:20" %}} - say it's one name of the father and the son and the spirit um not one name of the father another of the son another of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="628" display="10:28" %}} - the spirit it's one name and then again if we deal with it according to the Greek and at least the old way of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="639" display="10:39" %}} - understanding the word name um we would know it's talking about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="645" display="10:45" %}} - person persons of the father and the son and the spirit and what that would point out to us is that Jesus is saying that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="656" display="10:56" %}} - essentially you are baptized into three persons now if they're not all equal it would be demeaning to have one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="665" display="11:05" %}} - associated with the other two inferior ones so it seems pretty straightforward that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="673" display="11:13" %}} - uh this baptism of the spirit essentially means that we are being associated with the Trinity with three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="683" display="11:23" %}} - persons who are utterly equal to each other and there is no you said inferiority between them yeah that's now  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="693" display="11:33" %}} - I think this point of the name here being singular uh we'll get to that like I said all of these things that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="700" display="11:40" %}} - talking about they're all related to each other and it's not like we need to draw artificial barriers of separation  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="707" display="11:47" %}} - between our discussion of the Trinity we're just looking at it from multiple angles um but just to rip on this a bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="714" display="11:54" %}} - the fact that there's one name goes right in accordance with this point that just brought up about uh if one member  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="721" display="12:01" %}} - were above the others it would be demeaning um for this profession to be kind of stated in equality here well but  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="729" display="12:09" %}} - even more so if they share the same name if they share the same name because there's one name here name in Greek in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="737" display="12:17" %}} - this verse is singular it's not plural and the name is obviously shared between the three members of the Trinity because  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="744" display="12:24" %}} - the word for name is not repeated three times in the Greek um that is it's not the name the father and the name of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="749" display="12:29" %}} - son and the name of the Holy Spirit as if there were three names there is one name here and for God to be represented  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="757" display="12:37" %}} - by the single name how could it be that one member of the Trinity um were greater than the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="766" display="12:46" %}} - others yet they all share the same uh the same name the same identifier um I just you know I I think that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="775" display="12:55" %}} - another inferential argument you know especially in so far as as I mentioned that this verse is talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="781" display="13:01" %}} - Authority right um you know we are yes we are baptizing them into the person of God and and through that teaching them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="791" display="13:11" %}} - um you know like after they become members of the body of Christ teaching them to observe everything um you know  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="798" display="13:18" %}} - as we've said before um the Bible presupposes these things it states these things it doesn't argue for them um and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="805" display="13:25" %}} - this is a prime example of that very true so the next topic that we are going to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="814" display="13:34" %}} - discuss here uh sort of on the shared equality and Eternity and substance of God is kind of talking about this idea  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="824" display="13:44" %}} - of Eternal function of deity uh the actions that God takes within creation so the verse that Dr luginbill uses in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="832" display="13:52" %}} - the study uh is talking about creation um and you know what you can actually see typo in the slides here I copied the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="841" display="14:01" %}} - scripture quotation here and then I changed the verse but I didn't change out the verse up here so this is wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="846" display="14:06" %}} - this is in Genesis of course um here let me Google this real quick and uh I'm sure it's Genesis one probably 126 yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="856" display="14:16" %}} - so that's what that header should be I'll fix that before I post them um so quoting Genesis chap 1 verse 26 not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="866" display="14:26" %}} - Matthew 28 again um when God says this let us make Mankind in our image in our likeness so note the first person plural  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="876" display="14:36" %}} - here um and of course Audie and I have discussed this before in our recordings here on the Trinity uh this is one of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="884" display="14:44" %}} - those things uh where God being plural in the Hebrew Elohim um not God singular um you know perhaps the the Jews or the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="894" display="14:54" %}} - early Jews thought of it as a plural of majesty you might have heard that grammatical notion before uh is made  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="901" display="15:01" %}} - plural to show how great and Majestic God was but it also kind of leaves that question mark at the back of one's head  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="908" display="15:08" %}} - of well what does it mean for God to be plural um and then that's of course where the Trinity and the explicit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="915" display="15:15" %}} - teaching of the New Testament helps fill this in for us but where we're going with this in terms of the Eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="921" display="15:21" %}} - function of deity in terms of the activity of deity is that the three members of the trinity all participated  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="929" display="15:29" %}} - within creation um in fact we can see this um uh if you recall in the first couple verses of Genesis you know in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="938" display="15:38" %}} - beginning God created the heavens and the Earth um we know from various places in Scripture that Jesus Christ was the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="944" display="15:44" %}} - agent in creation that's what John chapter 1 uh the first few verses of the Gospel of John tells us um so Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="952" display="15:52" %}} - Christ was the agent but then we have and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters first several verses of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="957" display="15:57" %}} - Genesis still spirit is involved too um you know especially in so far as he is the one uh within creation who is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="967" display="16:07" %}} - presently restraining evil um so when the Restraint of the holy spirit is removed I believe it's first  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="975" display="16:15" %}} - Thessalonians or second Thessalonians I don't remember which one um that talks about the removal of restraint um well  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="983" display="16:23" %}} - things are going to happen on account of that um Holy Spirit active role in maintaining the order within creation  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="991" display="16:31" %}} - and of course everything handled under the authority of the father uh the planner the architect um so this is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1000" display="16:40" %}} - example here in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 ignore this um talking about the creation of man specifically but it also  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1008" display="16:48" %}} - holds for creation generally it also holds for uh God's plan in the Redemption of mankind um so just as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1017" display="16:57" %}} - another example um the when Jesus Paid for human sin upon the cross obviously um the son in the Trinity fully God yet  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1028" display="17:08" %}} - fully man um Peter tells us that he bore our sins upon his body on the tree um but that was only made possible through  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1036" display="17:16" %}} - the Holy Spirit and the father was the one who accepted the payment so um we might aduce multiple other examples  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1044" display="17:24" %}} - where all three members of the Trinity play this crucial active role in the working out of God's plan throughout  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1054" display="17:34" %}} - human history throughout creation um and so this is what we mean by they have an equal share in the Eternal function of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1061" display="17:41" %}} - deity um they are all uh God in so far as and and they all share equality in so far as when God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1071" display="17:51" %}} - affects his plans all of them have an equal role to play even if it is not the same role um so so in this way there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1080" display="18:00" %}} - isn't any difference in status there isn't any difference in the activity of deity um as if for example one person in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1088" display="18:08" %}} - the Trinity uh has to do all the things while the other people in the Trinity aren't involved somehow um and just to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1096" display="18:16" %}} - keep pushing this idea of how different this is for us as humans right no matter what within Human Relationships there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1103" display="18:23" %}} - kind of a give and take maybe it in any given point in time um so anyone who's ever worked on a group project in school  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1110" display="18:30" %}} - knows exactly what I'm talking about um does everyone completely equally pull their  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1116" display="18:36" %}} - weight you know even if we do our best even if the other members in your group are not lacking in their  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1123" display="18:43" %}} - motivation inevitably it's just it doesn't happen however that is because we are humans not God and God in his  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1132" display="18:52" %}} - plans always operates in unity between the three members of the Trinity um mm  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1141" display="19:01" %}} - yeah so the passage you mentioned earlier was actually 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 um about the working of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1150" display="19:10" %}} - holy spirit so I don't think there's very much else to say the Bible does annunciate on every I mean I think that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1158" display="19:18" %}} - that passage in Genesis chapter one is it's it's a brilliant light on it let us make man in our own image I've heard  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1167" display="19:27" %}} - Jo Witnesses argue that that was God speaking to the angels which was very interesting very interesting argument to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1174" display="19:34" %}} - make that God would essentially be what um enlisting the angels in the creation of man but then it goes along with their  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1184" display="19:44" %}} - own um conception of Jesus Christ as a god even though of course they don't publicly wed themselves to polytheism  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1195" display="19:55" %}} - they don't believe in multiple gods except that Jesus has to be one in order for John chapter one verse one to make  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1201" display="20:01" %}} - some sense to them so I I think um the Bible enunciates on every page I mean uh I think it's um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1214" display="20:14" %}} - Isaiah chapter 9 where it talks about the spirit of God the spirit of this the spirit of that and all of the all of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1221" display="20:21" %}} - that being upon um um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1228" display="20:28" %}} - the anointed one so we see multiple things multiple places in the Bible I I think it's worth  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1240" display="20:40" %}} - repeating that we're not we're not making uh would I say an argue on I don't know how to put that but  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1251" display="20:51" %}} - because yes we are making making an argument yes that that teaching is being developed but essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1258" display="20:58" %}} - this is this is the say the Bible says this and that and that and that's why we claim this so it's not like oh there's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1267" display="21:07" %}} - trinity and now we have to go to the Bible to make a case for it it's more like if you read the Bible it basically  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1277" display="21:17" %}} - presents the Trinity as a given and in functionality we see the same thing it it takes a lot of work like um I think  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1286" display="21:26" %}} - that there is there are probably better ways that one can demonstrate how much work it takes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1293" display="21:33" %}} - to dismiss this than what the Jehovah's Witnesses had to do they basically had to retranslate the Bible to eliminate  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1303" display="21:43" %}} - evidence of the Trinity and to recast basically a number of doctrines  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1312" display="21:52" %}} - but particularly the Trinity that's one thing that they take a lot of issue with and you find that even with their  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1319" display="21:59" %}} - retranslating of the Bible they can't get away from it they still have to deal with it I should add  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1326" display="22:06" %}} - that this translation business that we're talking about it's not merely that they made some different interpretive  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1332" display="22:12" %}} - choices here they mistranslate according to objective principles of grammar shall we say you know they do violence to the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1342" display="22:22" %}} - translation and like AI said still kind of has to be like that to make things work Con  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1348" display="22:28" %}} - um and we pointed this out before um you know and I think it's very good that we're emphasizing it that the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1355" display="22:35" %}} - speaks as if it is true in fact the better way to put it is if any of these points that we're going over in this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1361" display="22:41" %}} - entire series uh you can kind of prove them through what is typically known as redu you ad absurdum if you say this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1369" display="22:49" %}} - point is false and then you go try to read passages in the Bible it just doesn't work um so this point that we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1376" display="22:56" %}} - on right here if if you try to say that somehow uh all members of the Trinity are God and they're all somehow equal to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1384" display="23:04" %}} - each other but they aren't equal to each other in the Eternal function of deity in the salvation of mankind in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1392" display="23:12" %}} - working out of God's plan throughout human history then in what sense can they be said to be equal how how do all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1397" display="23:17" %}} - these passages that talk about the various things that the members of the Trinity have done throughout human  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1402" display="23:22" %}} - history how do those work then um you know and of course there are things we don't know like so for example um just  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1411" display="23:31" %}} - as we humans have a hard time seeing in human relationships like for example that between a commanding officer in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1418" display="23:38" %}} - military and his soldiers is there equality there uh given that one of them has adopted in their position the one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1426" display="23:46" %}} - giving orders right um and I think maybe this is maybe this is something worth discussing a bit um in so far as within  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1434" display="23:54" %}} - the roles of the Trinity the father is typically seen as has put it before as the representation of deity um as the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1442" display="24:02" %}} - one who plays the part of deity uh to the world um so that's why he is in the third heaven separated from sin um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1451" display="24:11" %}} - because he is the face of deity shall we say um but these roles that do exist um it's not uh one of a difference in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1462" display="24:22" %}} - status um it is merely a role um and we will talk about rol of the Trinity more that is a future topic of conversation  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1471" display="24:31" %}} - so we sh get too sidetracked here but where we're going with this again is simply that if you start removing uh  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1479" display="24:39" %}} - kind of like I think the game's called Jenga right where you remove blocks and once you remove enough blocks the tower  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1485" display="24:45" %}} - just inevitably falls down um most of these things that we're talking about you don't even have to remove a bunch of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1492" display="24:52" %}} - them before it stops working you just remove one or two and suddenly large parts of the Bible spe specifically the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1498" display="24:58" %}} - New Testament just don't make sense anymore there is no way to reconcile the passages uh I mean you can do your best  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1505" display="25:05" %}} - to go through interpretive gymnastics to explain how this actually means that and whatnot but it just it just obviously  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1512" display="25:12" %}} - doesn't feel right and that's what happens when you start trying to Monkey around with fundamental conceptions of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1520" display="25:20" %}} - three persons one essence or one Ence three persons it just makes large parts of the interpretation of New Testament  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1527" display="25:27" %}} - Passage that that mentions the members of the Trinity just no longer work  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1534" display="25:34" %}} - yeah yeah and I I I I I don't think we can go through every single instance um where the Bible demonstrates the um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1546" display="25:46" %}} - Eternal function of each member of the Trinity but like he just said if anyone  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1555" display="25:55" %}} - bothers to do the the SoCal well the scientific test of um trying to falsify the arguments that we are making  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1568" display="26:08" %}} - essentially and we go okay the spirit is not he's not um a member of the Trinity because  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1579" display="26:19" %}} - his function does not fit or something like that then you start to interpret everything that the Bible says that the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1588" display="26:28" %}} - spirit actually does in terms of that the whole Bible becomes nearly chaotic and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1599" display="26:39" %}} - insensate that's what would happen do the same to the Lord Jesus and this is actually why this is one way that you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1605" display="26:45" %}} - can very quickly tell what um um uh religions or sects are really not Christian even if they claim to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1618" display="26:58" %}} - let's use the ones we've named for example jov's Witnesses they reject the Holy Spirit as a person refuse to accept  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1627" display="27:07" %}} - the Lord Jesus as God so let's talk about how that works in terms of the work of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1636" display="27:16" %}} - Salvation who what are we being saved from sin against to God and how are we to be saved from sin do they accept that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1648" display="27:28" %}} - the Bible says essentially that we're in helpless situation we cannot redeem our own selves we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1656" display="27:36" %}} - all have fallen short of Grace there is no we cannot fix what we have broken it's broken it's spilled milk there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1665" display="27:45" %}} - nothing we can do about it okay so if we accept that to be true and I believe the translation of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1671" display="27:51" %}} - Bible does next thing we have to ask is how then is this um um damage in our relationship to God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1682" display="28:02" %}} - to be fixed well God has to do something himself according to the Bible I am your savior and there is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1696" display="28:16" %}} - savior besides me that's what the Bible says God himself claimed that he is the only one who is the savior that makes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1702" display="28:22" %}} - sense it makes sense because who else is going to save us now they claim that some Angel was able to save us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1711" display="28:31" %}} - okay how is an Angel going to be able to save us exactly what is the sacrifice that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1719" display="28:39" %}} - require to save us it has to be a sacrifice that matches the sin talking about from God's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1727" display="28:47" %}} - perspective there is nothing nothing that we can do nothing that we can offer the way that the Bible puts essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1736" display="28:56" %}} - is that a man can not save himself by with his own life or and he cannot pay the price for  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1742" display="29:02" %}} - another that's how I think it's in some I don't remember the the chapter now so we are in a very bad a very bad spot and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1752" display="29:12" %}} - essentially we have learned whatever needs to be done is going to be massive an ordinary human being can do  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1759" display="29:19" %}} - it why do we think an angel would be able to pay the price for our set especially given that there is only  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1769" display="29:29" %}} - one Savior and there is none discip so Jesus comes and he dies on the cross and somehow that is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1780" display="29:40" %}} - enough we are still looking at the part of the Bible that I think is also translated correctly in their own Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1787" display="29:47" %}} - which says that there is no savior besides me God how then do we reconcile the fact that someone's sacrifice was  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1796" display="29:56" %}} - able to save us if that person is not God we start to have craziness and of course the enter the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1805" display="30:05" %}} - gymnastics which is essentially oh no no no no he's not the the Savior it's because someone else sent him that that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1811" display="30:11" %}} - person is the real savior he's just the tool for the Salvation okay so he can't claim to be the Savior what about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1817" display="30:17" %}} - Matthew chapter 1 Matthew chapter 1 essentially says he will be called Jesus because he will save his people from  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1824" display="30:24" %}} - their sins so essentially he's going to be called SA that's literally what his name is okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1830" display="30:30" %}} - so how do you make sense of that no no no no it doesn't really mean this and that so basically let's forget what the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1836" display="30:36" %}} - Bible says to accommodate what you say what about the holy spirit Bible tells us that it is through him that this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1844" display="30:44" %}} - eternal sacrifice was offered I think how how was it put who through the eternal spirit offered himself up that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1851" display="30:51" %}} - how the Bible said it was not Eternal sacrifice it was through the eternal spirit this sacrifice was made the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1857" display="30:57" %}} - eternal spirit what a word what a term to use now remove the spirit from this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1865" display="31:05" %}} - picture remove him as a person now you've already come into a lot of trouble just by doing that the claim of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1872" display="31:12" %}} - the holy spirit is not even a person much less a member of the Trinity so if we were to adopt that mindset that he is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1880" display="31:20" %}} - not a person he is not um uh a member of the Trinity then what about everything that the Bible  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1890" display="31:30" %}} - says about his part in Salvation the fact that he convicts us of sin now this is an impersonal Force  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1899" display="31:39" %}} - somehow able to persuade us that we are sinful very interesting thing to do but of course they try to use the loophole  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1909" display="31:49" %}} - that he is God's Force so he's not a a person he's just something that God us uses to mess with with our consciences  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1918" display="31:58" %}} - and get us to appreciate that we're sinful people and then Jesus himself was going to pay a terrible price on the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1928" display="32:08" %}} - cross and he was going to do it through this Force I mean at a certain point we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1935" display="32:15" %}} - in sci-fi land where things don't seem to be what they are they they they don't make sense so that's what happens once  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1945" display="32:25" %}} - we start looking at things from perspective of trying to falsify the Trinity once we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1952" display="32:32" %}} - remove the the claims of the Bible that the that Jesus is God that the holy spirit is not only a person but also God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1962" display="32:42" %}} - himself all of a sudden a lot of things that would otherwise have made sense become  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1970" display="32:50" %}} - nonsensical and that is why the Jehovah's Witnesses don't really believe for all their claim and they do  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1978" display="32:58" %}} - claim it they don't really believe that reconciliation to God results from the sacrifice of Jesus they believe it comes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1987" display="33:07" %}} - from the works that they do now there's another set that works exactly the same way the Roman Catholic  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="1996" display="33:16" %}} - church talk a good game but because they don't appreciate exactly who did what they end up in a place where they talk  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2005" display="33:25" %}} - about Grace as if it were asert would put it angel dust that is sprinkled on you to make you look good so essentially  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2016" display="33:36" %}} - it's it's this thing that that that is sprinkled on you it's not that God has given you a gracious gift that is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2025" display="33:45" %}} - extremely generous person who has brought you back into fellowship with him in spite of the fact that you have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2031" display="33:51" %}} - done everything wrong and caused yourself to be out of fellowship with him no it's this sprinkling of angel  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2039" display="33:59" %}} - dust on you to make you good and what you're supposed to do is continue to take the sacraments and do this and that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2047" display="34:07" %}} - to keep the grace flowing once you cut out the functions that is essentially saying what this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2056" display="34:16" %}} - person does as God Almighty everything starts to fall out and just basically enter chaos and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2067" display="34:27" %}} - Madness it doesn't make sense anymore it doesn't matter that you claim to believe that your your sin was paid for by  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2073" display="34:33" %}} - Jesus's sacrifice you don't even know who Jesus is you don't even know who made the sacrifice possible and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2078" display="34:38" %}} - therefore in the end you assume a lot of responsibility for something you are completely unable to do I mean let me  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2085" display="34:45" %}} - just jump in I don't I don't want to completely interrupt your flow but just say a couple sentences what we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2091" display="34:51" %}} - talking about with respect to atonement Theory salvation itself this is one of of those Eternal functions of deity that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2098" display="34:58" %}} - human beings uh you you've gone through this um in the way that you've approached talking about how these sects  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2105" display="35:05" %}} - they get things wrong here right but one of the things that's so pervasive about legalism is that human beings somehow  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2114" display="35:14" %}} - are claiming that they have the function of Salvation just think about how insane that is right and this is why we call it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2120" display="35:20" %}} - the the magic Grace dust that somehow by what we do we can have that Grace flowing from God rather than it being  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2130" display="35:30" %}} - God himself and and and like we said for all appearances for all accounts people will say this with their lips but then  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2137" display="35:37" %}} - it's a matter of what do their positions imply how do they have to read certain passages in the Bible to make it not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2144" display="35:44" %}} - contradict actually it's one of those things that sometimes I never understand because some of what we're talking about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2149" display="35:49" %}} - like you said even though the Jehovah's Witnesses butcher certain parts of their translation it still gets you most of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2156" display="35:56" %}} - the way there like you know like you can argue with them in their translation and you can still get to the point where you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2164" display="36:04" %}} - kind of need the Trinity same deal you know the Roman Catholics they don't even mutilate the Bible um it's one of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2170" display="36:10" %}} - things where all these verses well Roman Catholics for the most part have those same verses in their Bibles too right um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2177" display="36:17" %}} - yeah how does it work you know that but you know people manag to twist it somehow or another and it's part of that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2185" display="36:25" %}} - is by imputing some of these things that are functions of God Alone to things other than God right to sacraments or  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2194" display="36:34" %}} - salvation or priests although the Catholic church is like less blatant about that nowadays like as in they've  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2202" display="36:42" %}} - backed off a little bit from you have to be a member of the Catholic Church otherwise you're not even saved and you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2207" display="36:47" %}} - have to take Catholic mass every Sunday otherwise you're not even saved and things like that because you know that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2212" display="36:52" %}} - bad PR but um that sort of thing yeah what does that have to do with our record Being set straight in the eyes of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2220" display="37:00" %}} - the almighty it just doesn't of course of course that's that's exactly the point that once we we lose sight of of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2228" display="37:08" %}} - the function of the persons each person of the holy of the of the Trinity what what essentially results is that Madness  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2236" display="37:16" %}} - and that chaos one thing that just occurred to me as you were speaking was also the fact that when it comes to to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2245" display="37:25" %}} - what scientific this is another place to that you see what a world view of the Trinity can do to you now we we hear  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2255" display="37:35" %}} - this in the Bible he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world right that is really really big thing to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2263" display="37:43" %}} - say and in fact this is why being a believer in these days after the cross is such an amazing thing that for the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2270" display="37:50" %}} - first time um since human history after Jesus died we know have God basically residing in US permanently that's a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2281" display="38:01" %}} - big deal so you have God in you but because obviously the holy spirit is not God you can see what what results from  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2292" display="38:12" %}} - people just ignoring His function the fact that he is God is why Bible says that he works in you that's a very  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2301" display="38:21" %}} - interesting thing it actually puts it this way for it is God who works in you both to Will and to do of his own good  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2307" display="38:27" %}} - pleasure so you have God himself residing in you working with you to Will and to do of his good pleasure but now  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2316" display="38:36" %}} - it's not God it's just some Force residing in you and what results from that well if I'm going to do good things  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2325" display="38:45" %}} - it's up to me if I'm going to get anything right it's up to me you're not relying on him because after all that's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2333" display="38:53" %}} - not God I mean it just but just think about it for a second you know this verse that you quote here on the face of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2339" display="38:59" %}} - it you could argue that maybe the Holy Spirit was a created thing that just happened to be greater than Satan okay  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2347" display="39:07" %}} - you know like philosophically it works but like you said other places in the Bible talk about God working within us  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2353" display="39:13" %}} - so now you have to argue that God is in us and this other person who's not God but is yet greater than Satan is also in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2359" display="39:19" %}} - us right you have to because both of those things are said in scripture right that's the position you have to take if  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2367" display="39:27" %}} - you don't believe that the holy spirit is God and then how do you know it's one versus the other you know like again as  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2373" display="39:33" %}} - we've been emphasizing these problems are inescapable the second you start going down that path you bump into them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2379" display="39:39" %}} - head first um yeah yeah that's the bottom line really y so you know I'm not we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2388" display="39:48" %}} - gone through some good examples I mean I should emphasize that Ai and I we could probably keep going all day here right I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2394" display="39:54" %}} - know you gave a couple good examples off the top of your head you know of various uh people going down  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2400" display="40:00" %}} - this path to one extent or another but this is the consequence of not accepting the all three members of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2409" display="40:09" %}} - deity in full all three members and how they all interact to do these things in the plan of human Redemption um so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2418" display="40:18" %}} - whether that was uh the sacrifice on the cross sanctification those are two examples we brought up now all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2425" display="40:25" %}} - members of the are integral to these things that affect human salvation um and so we can't be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2434" display="40:34" %}} - wishy-washy on this right um this is why the Trinity is rightly and properly considered one of the core doctrines of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2442" display="40:42" %}} - Christianity um there are certain things that maybe we call debatable that you get wrong you can still be a Christian  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2450" display="40:50" %}} - right understanding who Jesus was what he did and the nature of God how is sacrifice was on this is some of the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2458" display="40:58" %}} - fundamental stuff right yeah so and that is one reason I should emphasize why uh getting one of these things wrong makes  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2467" display="41:07" %}} - a whole bunch of scripture not work right because to a greater or lesser extent right uh we know that everything  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2473" display="41:13" %}} - in the Bible should be interpreted by everything else in the Bible that is the contextual approach we need to take when  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2479" display="41:19" %}} - we interpret scripture but there are certain doctrines when if you get them wrong it messes up a whole lot more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2485" display="41:25" %}} - things than other right this is one of those that yeah if you get the Trinity wrong it messes up  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2491" display="41:31" %}} - all sorts of things in a way that some other doctrines maybe you get something wrong  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2497" display="41:37" %}} - and it messes up two or three places not the entire New Testament um that's why we call this core and Central though so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2505" display="41:45" %}} - yeah that's true that's true all right well good discussion here this is why it's important for us to acknowledge the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2514" display="41:54" %}} - full share of the activity of God the Eternal function of deity that the members of the Trinity possess because  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2521" display="42:01" %}} - all three are integral so creation is the example in Genesis chapter 1 Dr luganville used we've talked also about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2527" display="42:07" %}} - as I've said um about Redemption on the cross as well as sanctification and there's others as well where God works  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2534" display="42:14" %}} - together the three members of the Trinity to affect his plan for human salvation um so that is where we'll wrap  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2542" display="42:22" %}} - this one and in the next one we'll be talking about substance so the last point that we're going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2552" display="42:32" %}} - making here in this lesson is talking about the equal share in the substance of deity so thus far we've talked about  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2559" display="42:39" %}} - status and the Eternal function or activity now we're talking about substance we don't want to get too  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2565" display="42:45" %}} - bogged down here in uh maybe what we might call the technical jargony specifics um but the verse that Dr  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2574" display="42:54" %}} - lugabill uses for this one comes from 2 Corinthians chapter 13:14 and this is one of those  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2581" display="43:01" %}} - benedictions now those of you who've watched this series all the way through um might remember it might be more  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2587" display="43:07" %}} - recent in your memory where some of the verses that we included upfront in our discussion of the Trinity we talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2593" display="43:13" %}} - about how it comes up in uh the benedictions as here um and kind of the salutations the the greetings and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2601" display="43:21" %}} - letters um you know so for example in the very first part of 1 Peter chapter 1 um we hear a mention of all three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2610" display="43:30" %}} - members of the Trinity um chosen according to the for knowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying work  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2616" display="43:36" %}} - of the spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ all through members of the Trinity right um but here specifically  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2622" display="43:42" %}} - looking at this idea of substance of deity this is what Dr L bill says so as seen from the attribution of goodness to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2630" display="43:50" %}} - all three members in the apostolic benediction of 2 Corinthians so um if you recall one of the so-called  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2637" display="43:57" %}} - essential characteristics of God that we discussed previously was that God is good uh that is a characteristic of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2646" display="44:06" %}} - deity um of the essence of God and so this verse is talking about what we shall call manifestations of goodness so  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2655" display="44:15" %}} - Grace is the policy of the goodness of God right we talked about that already love is the natural consequence or  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2662" display="44:22" %}} - emanation of the goodness of God and fellowship is the ultimate result of the goodness of God all of these are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2669" display="44:29" %}} - respectively here attributed to the son the father and the Holy Spirit and the benediction so the grace of the Lord  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2676" display="44:36" %}} - Jesus Christ the love of the father um I guess we're saying that that is implied right um because we have Lord God and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2685" display="44:45" %}} - then Spirit right we like you know cuos is the word for Lord in Greek and that refers to Jesus Christ and I'm assuming  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2692" display="44:52" %}} - I don't have the Greek in front of me but I'm assuming this is Theos and this is is numos the the word for Spirit um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2699" display="44:59" %}} - sorry Numa it's neuter um and so those probably be the words here but all three members of the Trinity have this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2708" display="45:08" %}} - characteristic goodness that Define them as God of all sharing that Essence uh which has as one of its characteristics  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2716" display="45:16" %}} - goodness um as an essential quality of deity um so if this sounds familiar it kind of should um because as I said all  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2725" display="45:25" %}} - of these things are uh kind of uh they all support each other right we're not trying to say new things here we are  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2733" display="45:33" %}} - just coming at this discussion of the Trinity from all the angles we possibly can and so when we talked about the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2739" display="45:39" %}} - essence of God before we were establishing what the essence of God was what we are now doing in this particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2745" display="45:45" %}} - lesson that we've been going through this time was establishing that all three members of the Trinity now that we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2751" display="45:51" %}} - have uh determined that there are in fact three persons in the Trinity well all of them equally share in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2758" display="45:58" %}} - consequences uh in the essential characteristics of the essence of God because as we'll see in the next lesson  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2765" display="46:05" %}} - that we go through all three of them are equal partakers in that Divine Essence so that's where we get the three persons  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2772" display="46:12" %}} - one Essence from right now we've been going through how all of them have the same status Eternal function or activity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2779" display="46:19" %}} - and substance coming about because they all share that same Essence which is what we'll cover in the next one but on  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2786" display="46:26" %}} - account of that this verse goes right through and says that all three members of the Trinity um have this eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2794" display="46:34" %}} - quality of goodness um in the way that Dr lville has kind of filled in here and that's why we say that all of them  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2801" display="46:41" %}} - possess that equal share in the substance of deity any points to Riff on here  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2808" display="46:48" %}} - Audie I've been trying to think um I'll admit this bit is a bit more complex for me but it it does make sense how he laid  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2817" display="46:57" %}} - things out that Grace is the policy of the goodness of God it's the generosity of God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2823" display="47:03" %}} - um I mean God did have the right as God to withhold his generosity I mean essentially because he is God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2833" display="47:13" %}} - creation he makes exists at his whims so he didn't have any need whatsoever to do anything for anyone was not under any  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2842" display="47:22" %}} - obligation to do so but Grace essentially is saying um even if I'm not obliged to do anything for you now we're  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2851" display="47:31" %}} - talking whether just in the in the business of first creation or it is um in the business of redemption  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2862" display="47:42" %}} - Redemption was after sin the business of first creation was before sin um we see that Grace play out in the particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2870" display="47:50" %}} - way for example that God even caused us to exist in the first place was an act of generosity if we didn't exist we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2878" display="47:58" %}} - wouldn't have any opportunity whatsoever to enjoy and experience the Marvel that is God and God is marvelous and he is an  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2889" display="48:09" %}} - amazing gift that you know to be given um so if if he did not create us and share  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2899" display="48:19" %}} - himself with us or offer us this opportunity to be with him then I mean he didn't have to and he did it anyway  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2908" display="48:28" %}} - and we sin we fall short of that generosity of his and he does not deem it necessary or even right to just wipe  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2920" display="48:40" %}} - out creation he could do that doesn't have to tolerate our sinfulness but he still goes on to  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2927" display="48:47" %}} - redeem us to offer us again an opportunity to be part of his eternal family to enjoy him forever which is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2937" display="48:57" %}} - amazing right so all of this um it's the goodness of God in the sense that that is how God actually defines his goodness  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2945" display="49:05" %}} - as deity himself it doesn't have to be that way so but as we know if deity was not like this then nothing would exist  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2954" display="49:14" %}} - that's actually how that works so um then the the the love of the father I actually tend to find myself edging in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2963" display="49:23" %}} - the direction of how God is love and basically I Define all of God's character in terms of his love but it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2970" display="49:30" %}} - does make sense too to see um love as a natural consequence of the goodness of God so instead of being the call from  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2978" display="49:38" %}} - which this goodness is actually demonstrated it's it's a consequence of that goodness because God is innately  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2986" display="49:46" %}} - good because he is innately good I don't think there's any other way I mean and of course the purpose of this particular  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="2994" display="49:54" %}} - one was to show how all three members of the Trinity possess the goodness characteristic of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3000" display="50:00" %}} - God um they possess it equally right um and how it works out so that we can say that there isn't there's no inequality  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3008" display="50:08" %}} - there is no one person of the Trinity gets it while the other doesn't that is kind of the purpose of this lesson in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3014" display="50:14" %}} - the series yeah that that's that's the point here I think that the reason like I said what I'm actually exploring is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3020" display="50:20" %}} - the complexity of this uh passage in my mind you know well is God good because he loves us or does God love us because  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3030" display="50:30" %}} - he's good I mean you know it's one of those things where you're right the Bible says that God is good and the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3037" display="50:37" %}} - Bible says that God loves us and so yeah you know a very human thing to try to start to to go through right but yeah  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3045" display="50:45" %}} - but but when when the the point that um you know the grace of the Lord Jesus the love of the of God and The Fellowship of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3052" display="50:52" %}} - the holy spirit all come together is that that is uh pretty obvious because again it's like the name of the father  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3060" display="51:00" %}} - and the son and the spirit thing when you associate three persons in this manner  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3067" display="51:07" %}} - you're essentially putting them on a level it's very hard to say things like um uh May the kindness of the president  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3076" display="51:16" %}} - and um the generosity of uh maybe the the chief of Army staff or something I mean by the time you start counting down  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3086" display="51:26" %}} - it's like why are you putting all these people together I mean if I have the kindness of the president I don't need  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3093" display="51:33" %}} - to have the generosity of the chief of Army staff because the president covers that right so but when you have um the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3103" display="51:43" %}} - love of of of the Lord Jesus and you have the the um sorry the grace of the Lord Jesus and the love of God the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3111" display="51:51" %}} - Father And The Fellowship of the holy spirit is essentially saying all the these three have to agree and they they  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3119" display="51:59" %}} - they have to agree in the sense that the three of them are separate persons and their Authority is equal to each other  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3127" display="52:07" %}} - so it makes sense to think of it in that way well let me not do too much exploration of this but it's something  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3134" display="52:14" %}} - that has been playing out in my head for a while yeah now I will say of course as we we went through a good bit in the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3141" display="52:21" %}} - last one how everything falls apart uh in interpreting the trinity you know in finding in scripture if you ignore  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3147" display="52:27" %}} - certain bits of it but this one I think is so false just on the face of it imagine if you were to argue that one  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3154" display="52:34" %}} - member of the Trinity was not inherently good just think about it right it's complete nonsense how how how can that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3162" display="52:42" %}} - even work given what we know from scripture right that absolutely if only the father and the son wanted the best  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3168" display="52:48" %}} - for us and somehow the spirit didn't you know like come on who who would Empower everything right and and of course it  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3174" display="52:54" %}} - would not make sense and light of the scriptures given what the spirit has done sure you know I don't think people  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3181" display="53:01" %}} - that's not their Vector of attack most of the time right but that's what we mean when we say they share the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3185" display="53:05" %}} - substance of deity right because the same thing holds for all of the other characteristics of God that we talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3191" display="53:11" %}} - about if you say that I mean for example that the father and the spirit are Eternal but not the son because the son  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3198" display="53:18" %}} - took on a human nature that's actually a much more common attack that is getting at this one here right that they are you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3205" display="53:25" %}} - know consubstantial because what this is getting at is that the son is co-eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3209" display="53:29" %}} - with the father and the spirit right you know again that's what we're going through here co-equal co-eternal  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3214" display="53:34" %}} - consubstantial if you say that the son doesn't have the same substance as the father and the spirit he's not God in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3221" display="53:41" %}} - the same way so to speak then people start throwing out eternity you know like the the um eternality of the Sun  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3230" display="53:50" %}} - the second person of the Trinity and then you get all sorts of theological problems so yeah um sort of they're not  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3236" display="53:56" %}} - made of the same substance I think that was why I was actually interested in complexity of this thing because but I  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3243" display="54:03" %}} - think the point that he is making essentially is that if we were to describe God in terms of a substance he  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3250" display="54:10" %}} - is good that's his substance his goodness and we see that through Grace Jesus is is is associated with that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3259" display="54:19" %}} - substance he he has it and through love the father has it through fellowship and all of these things are like three  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3268" display="54:28" %}} - emanations or three sort of like like I mean he used the word policy in another place examination and in another place  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3276" display="54:36" %}} - he says the result but all of them are like the outworking in some way of this goodness of God this substance this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3283" display="54:43" %}} - thing and it makes sense too given that Jesus did say no one is good but God that is like at the core definition of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3291" display="54:51" %}} - what God is in terms of his substance there's also life of course but then I think this makes sense you can use this  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3298" display="54:58" %}} - to see like you said that all three of them um share in this substance and you cannot speak of God being good and  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3308" display="55:08" %}} - somehow remove Jesus from that okay I think that that that that has called something back to mind for me um there's  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3317" display="55:17" %}} - often that argument that Jesus never claimed to be God because there's this passage where he said no no one is no  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3325" display="55:25" %}} - one is good except God and they say well if he was God he would have said there that he you know except me or accept God  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3334" display="55:34" %}} - and me or something but then Jesus didn't say he wasn't good he said no one is good but God and once you once you  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3345" display="55:45" %}} - you you take into account another thing too that he said in another place which of you can accuse me of sin that was a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3352" display="55:52" %}} - very big claim he was making I don't have any sin so I am good there you go too so when you put these things  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3361" display="56:01" %}} - together it does lead to the fact that to the extent that we're seeing that God's substance is this goodness Jesus  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3370" display="56:10" %}} - shares in it so does the spirit so does the father and if you were to eliminate any of them from this like you said a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3379" display="56:19" %}} - lot of things in the Bible would no longer make sense would on the particular passage of Jesus saying that  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3386" display="56:26" %}} - only God is good it's actually it's kind of fun to think about it now that you brought it to mind Jesus could it would  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3392" display="56:32" %}} - have been factually correct to say that he was himself good because he was because he's God but from a theological  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3398" display="56:38" %}} - perspective actually his statement is very true in that God all three members of the Trinity are good right absolutely  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3406" display="56:46" %}} - and we see that right there right now um so it would have been fine if Jesus had said that he was good because that's a  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3410" display="56:50" %}} - true statement it's also a true statement that God is good what's interesting is that God is good is  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3416" display="56:56" %}} - actually broader than Jesus is good because all three members of the Trinity are God um so exactly  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3423" display="57:03" %}} - exactly yeah okay that's my spio right all right well that's where we'll cut here so just as with the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3432" display="57:12" %}} - function Eternal function of deity the activity of deity all three members of the Trinity possess equally this so we  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3439" display="57:19" %}} - have them being co-equal co-eternal and consubstantial there isn't any difference in status in terms of how  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3447" display="57:27" %}} - they function in terms of the characteristics of God they share that has been the focus that we've had in  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3454" display="57:34" %}} - this lesson so just to recap the lesson that we've gone over this week we have been  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3462" display="57:42" %}} - talking about how even though there are three distinct persons in the Trinity that does not mean that there's any  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3469" display="57:49" %}} - inferiority or disparity of status activity or substance between them um that God shared s in all of this the  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3476" display="57:56" %}} - members of the Trinity are co-eternal and co-equal and consubstantial um and so in this we've  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3483" display="58:03" %}} - gone through the status of deity um they all have the authority of God they are all mentioned here in the Great  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3491" display="58:11" %}} - Commission um as being the person in whom we are baptized mentioned in the same breath um we went over how Genesis  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3500" display="58:20" %}} - 126 um uh when God talks about the creation of man that it is something that all three members of the Trinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3507" display="58:27" %}} - have this hand in so too with our Redemption and also our sanctification and other processes of Salvation shall  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3516" display="58:36" %}} - we say uh within God's plan for creation all members of the Trinity have this core part to play um and we also talked  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3524" display="58:44" %}} - about how all three members of the Trinity share the same substance they have those essential characteristics um  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3530" display="58:50" %}} - goodness was the example we used here um but some of the things relating to God's nature as well for example his Infinity  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3538" display="58:58" %}} - um so his his omnipotence his omnipresence his omniscience all three of those things apply to all members of  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3544" display="59:04" %}} - the Trinity and that's what it means for them to be consubstantial to have the same substance so this is what we have  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3550" display="59:10" %}} - been going over in this lesson here in the next lesson we will be talking more specifically about this one Essence bit  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3559" display="59:19" %}} - so we have now talked about the three person bit right that was the lesson before this one establish ing that there  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3565" display="59:25" %}} - are three distinct persons in the Trinity the next time we're going to be talking about how they share one Essence  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3571" display="59:31" %}} - uh AKA why we don't worship three Gods but why we worship one God in three persons that is what we are going to be  
{{% timestamp videoId="1m7n0vUWqMY" time="3579" display="59:39" %}} - talking about next time
