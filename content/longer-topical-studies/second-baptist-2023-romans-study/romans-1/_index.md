{{% note %}}
For most of the sections on this page, I link to pages from my [verse-by-verse study on Romans](/verse-by-verse-studies/romans/). I started writing responses to the questions here, but then the scope grew and I decided to convert it to a formal verse-by-verse study.

Later chapters in this Second Baptist series will have sections that are generally shorter, and will also stay standalone.

### Who are "they" (verse 32)? {#who-are-they-verse-32}

This verse has in mind not only those who *do* evil, but also those who *approve* of it. Those who sit on the sidelines and applaud when people do "what ought not to be done" (verse 28).

To use a modern example, those who actively lobby for homosexuality and promote it, even encourage it... these people will come in for judgement too. Not just those people who are themselves practicing homosexuals.
