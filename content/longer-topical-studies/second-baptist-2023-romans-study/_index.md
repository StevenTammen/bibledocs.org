title: Second Baptist - 2023 Romans Study

summary: >-
   This series is a verse-by-verse study of Romans based upon an in-person Bible study from the college/career group at Second Baptist in 2023. The contents of this study are more my thoughts on the discussion questions raised as part of this Bible study than an accurate reflection of what we went over as a group.

## About this study {#about-this-study}

Jeff usually gives us a number of questions to talk about as we go through the text. This study uses these questions as a starting point for me to think through and explore the material as we go over it.

## ...Why? {#why}

If I'm thinking about the materials anyway, jotting things down to do research later, and then actually doing said research, writing it up in some form helps me capture it for the future just for myself, so I don't forget things. Sharing it publicly on the internet is a step past that, to be sure, but it's mostly because I'm doing it anyway.

Maybe other people will find it interesting too. That is the hope.
