### Verses 1-10

#### Who is God's chosen people?

It may be tempting to say that Israel is God's chosen people. But then there is Romans 9:6. And actually the thrust of verses 1-6 here in Romans 11 is exactly the same in terms of not all Israel being Israel (but only the remnant chosen by grace). And how about Romans 11:20 later in the chapter (speaking of the people of Israel as the "natural branches")---"they were broken off because of unbelief"? Branches that are cut off are not "chosen", even if they may be "natural".

One might also be tempted to stop after saying that all those who choose God are God's chosen people (in the sense that God foreknew their choice and therefore chose them from eternity past to be His). After all, that is very much true. Those who belong to the body of Christ, "those in the vine", if you will (cf. verses 11-24 later in this chapter, and also see John 15), *are* God's chosen people.

But it also true that the people of (spiritual) Israel have some "unfinished business" with God in a way that Gentile unbelievers do not. The "hardening in part" mentioned in Romans 11:25 will begin to be stripped away under the ministry of the 144,000 prophesied in Revelation, alongside the ministry of the Two Witnesses also mentioned therein. Some will believe through these efforts of evangelization. And then when Jesus returns in glory (and they "look upon him who they pierced"---cf. Romans 1:7 with Zechariah 12:10 and John 19:37), there will be a massive wave of belief among the Jews, and Israel will come to salvation once more, picking back up the torch of witness they had dropped (so to speak).

If this all makes things seem more confusing not less, the short of it all is that we *are* chosen---Jew and Gentile alike---when we believe in Jesus Christ. God's chosen people are those who believe, as this chapter here in Romans 11 is perfectly clear about. But the people of Israel (presently experiencing a hardening in part) are prophesied to return to the Lord in the future, and we shouldn't neglect that point either.

#### Why do you think God chooses them?

The short answer to this question is that God chooses all those those who choose Him. (Or, more properly speaking, has chosen from eternity past all those whom He foreknew as choosing Him. The distinction is important, since God is not reactionary, but exists outside spacetime, and has foreordained everything that has, is, and will happen, from beginning to end).

But I think a more interesting question is why God may have arranged history in such a way that He only ends up choosing X number of people in different times and places in human history (i.e., distributes the proportion of the faithful as He does, across times and cultures). What do I mean by this? If you take the remnant mentioned in verse 5 as those in view for this question (i.e., the "them" that are chosen), well then "why were there 7,000 of them at that time, rather than more or less? Why were these centralized in Israel, rather than spread out across cultures?". One might go on.

Verse 5 and verse 6 are quite emphatic that these people of the remnant were chosen by grace, *not* on account of works. That is, the existence of this remnant (of belief) among the wider population is entirely because of God's providential ordering of history. It is not that these people do not have free will. It is that God's plan will not be moved, since it was made according to perfect foreknowledge.

But even more than that, why is this remnant of grace emphasized as it is in scripture? Why the emphasis on God's ordination through grace? This passage from from Romans 9:




What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? 23 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory— 24 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 25 As he says in Hosea:

“I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people;
    and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”[i]

26 and,

“In the very place where it was said to them,
    ‘You are not my people,’
    there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”[j]

27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:

“Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea,
    only the remnant will be saved.
28 For the Lord will carry out
    his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”[k]

29 It is just as Isaiah said previously:

“Unless the Lord Almighty
    had left us descendants,
we would have become like Sodom,
    we would have been like Gomorrah.”






So... why? Let me put it this way. There are plenty of cultures throughout history that have been, as far as we know, entirely devoid of belief in the being whom sociologists call the "Judeo-Christian God", and therefore entirely devoid of the sort of believing remnant mentioned here. So why did God providentially shepherd a remnant of believers in Israel, no matter how bad things got (cf. Elijah's proclamation that "he is the only one!" in 1 Kings 19:10, 14---which is what Romans 11:3 is quoting)?

Well, let me put it this way, what exactly is the alternative? Even in rebellion, the people of Israel were God's people. With few exceptions (cf. Ruth), foreigners had no interest in the God of Israel. In other words, if God did not preserve a remnant of belief throughout the centuries in Israel according to His foreknowledge and for His glory, well, human belief would die out altogether. And in fact, if God were not constantly shielding humanity from the power or Satan and the demons, this elimination of faith from the world would not be some slow decline, but rather instantaneous. Satan would simply massacre all of the elect in a single moment, if ever God let him.

You see, Satan has been trying from the very beginning to turn mankind utterly against God. There was the Fall, yes, but how about Nimrod and the tower of Babel? The Nephilim of Genesis 6 (leading to the flood)? Satan has *always* been trying to counter God's plan for human salvation (see [here](https://ichthys.com/Satans-Rebellion-Part5.htm#Counter-Strategy) for more on Satan's counter-strategy that seeks to turn humanity away from God).

But God will never let Satan completely win. That is actually what "the gates of hell shall not prevail against [the Church]" means in Matthew 16:18. This verse is terribly misinterpreted most of the time---and actually, not just in regard to Catholic claims of the supposed primacy of Peter (which typically proof-text by misinterpreting this verse and its context... the Church is built on the sure cornerstone of Jesus Christ, not Peter, as anyone who reads, e.g., Matthew 21:42-44 and Isaiah 28:16 ought to find dead obvious). You see, most Christians decide to interpret "will not prevail" as something along the lines of "won't even dent in the slightest" more than "will not completely destroy, even if coming pretty close to such". Basically, people think that the Church visible has been "doing good" for the last 2,000 years. While readily agreeing with the Bible's pronouncement that not all Israel is Israel, somehow they think that "all the Church" (or something more along those lines than not) is the Church.

They would be wrong. Just as there was only a small remnant of *only 7,000 people* in 1 Kings 19 (which remnant is mentioned here in the beginning of Romans 11), so too has there only ever been a small remnant of those truly on the right path (or anything even approaching it) ever since then. Jesus and His followers were certainly excluded and "othered". And in fact, this principle---which certainly held for the entire Old Testament history of believers in Israel, and for Jesus and His disciples---this principle has never ceased being in effect in the slightest. It has applied (and will continue to apply) in the Church Age as well.

It is not necessary---and in fact, is deeply problematic---for us to try to judge the salvation of others in all this. One can freely point out that people are very much not acting in accordance with the Bible (or acting in any way remotely close to such), without ever having to go there.

Having some true belief in Jesus Christ (even if regrettably off-track in many ways) is better than no belief at all, it is true. But the lukewarm, God warns, will be spit out of His mouth (cf. Revelation 3:15-16).

And so it is that we should never seek to personally test the line of whether or not very marginal believers can be "part of the remnant". Rather, we should make every effort to be among the small, select few that actually esteem God over the world as He calls humanity to, following wherever God leads. Because unlike with the lukewarm, God never spits the red-hot out of His mouth---instead, He cherishes this small group, and heaps them with praise and honor and glory.

To pull us back on topic, God providentially preserves a remnant of true belief across history to preserve His witness in the world, and to show His faithfulness to believing mankind. He wouldn't have to do this, but does so entirely out of His grace. Praise be to Him that He does!

Someone may ask then---is not the unconditional blessing of this specific line of descent inherently unfair, since no man can choose to whom he is born? Aren't those of us not born to this line at a disadvantage? Well, not really:

Romans 3:22-24

This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

All are saved by grace through faith. All have free will. God's Justice is perfect. That is all we should need to say on these matters... if we would just believe as we ought!

You might compare the question of "How is it fair for some to be born rich, but others poor?" Well, what does wealth or poverty have to do with salvation and doing what God wants of you? The battlefield may look different, but the battle is the same. It is really no different here in this case of Jews and Gentiles.

God foreknows our choices---all of them---and puts us in the perfect place to fulfill His Will, all while completely respecting our free will. So in fulfilling His promise to the Patriarchs (in always placing some believers among their descendants), God in no ways violates human free will, and in no way does anything unfair or unjust.

Compare the words of Genesis 12:1-3 (especially verse 3) with 
Romans 11:11-15 and Romans 11:25-32. It is *not* somehow because God wishes to arbitrarily elevate some group of people while leaving all others to stay cursed and hopeless. No, the calling of Israel was for the blessing of the world! Through their rejection the gospel came to the Gentiles (Romans 11:11, 12, 15), and their return to the fold (Romans 11:25-27) will usher in the Millennium, wherein Jesus Christ will perfectly rule the world from Jerusalem.

Romans 11:32---God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all."




#### What is the importance of grace (verse 5)?

#### How is grace defined (verse 6)?

#### Why did God harden most of their hearts (verse 4)?

### Verses 11-24

#### Can we understand God's plan?

We won't see the full details. Mystery of the Gentiles -- Acts 10, Peter/Cornelius, John 4 woman at well (bad blood between the Jews and Samaritans), also cf. parable of the good Samaritan.

It needs to be us getting on God's train, not God getting on our train.

#### Does this scripture demonstrate Romans 8:28

sure. Plan for salvation of all. Everything God does is for his glory.

#### How much appreciation do we show for being grafted into the tree of life?

Not as much as we should. Joy when people are saved, appreciate His grace in grafting us in.

#### Which is most important, the kindness or severity of God (verse 22)?

Both important. Two sides of a road both leading to a ditch.

#### What does it mean to "continue in His kindness"?

Verse 22 -- "Otherwise you will be cut off." Thank Him for all the things He has done for us. God's grace. acknowledge that all we have comes from His hand, rather than pretending otherwise.

### Verses 25-36

#### Are we ever guilty of being wise in our own eyes?

Of course. Unjustifiably so.

#### How difficult is it to understand God, His thoughts, or His ways?

Verse 33. Impossible. finite beings vs. infinite Creator.

#### What does verse 36 mean?

What is ours? Nothing. All the glory goes to God because absolutely everything is God's.
