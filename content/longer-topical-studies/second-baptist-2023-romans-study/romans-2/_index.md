{{% note %}}
For some of the sections on this page, I link to pages from my [verse-by-verse study on Romans](/verse-by-verse-studies/romans/). I started writing responses to the questions here, but then the scope grew and I decided to convert it to a formal verse-by-verse study.

Later chapters in this Second Baptist series will have sections that are generally shorter, and will also stay standalone.
