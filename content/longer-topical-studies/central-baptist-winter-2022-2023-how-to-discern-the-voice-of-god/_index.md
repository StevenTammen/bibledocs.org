   This series expands on some of the things discussed in the Daily Discipleship Guide for the Winter 2022-2023 Young Adult Sunday School class at Central Baptist Church, Warner Robins. This particular study is focused on the topic of how to discern the voice of God, and what goes into to doing that properly. Developing spiritual discernment is an important facet of growing up to spiritual maturity -- being able to determine what God is calling us to in all matters big and small. Perhaps it doesn't sound so hard, but one very quickly realizes that we face such a staggering number of decisions every day that trying to consistently reason out what to do based upon prayer and searching the Bible is no trivial matter when taken seriously. So how ought we do it effectively? How ought we make out the voice of God? We'll talk some about that here in this study.

### Summary {#introduction-summary}

This page goes over some basic meta information about this study on BibleDocs.

#### About this study {#introduction-about-this-study}

The Sunday morning class for the [college/career group](https://www.centralwr.com/college-singles) at [Central Baptist](https://www.centralwr.com/) in Warner Robins is going through a study in the class workbooks. This series here is just a collection of whatever thoughts I have about the material from each week.

I'll reference the starting page number in the workbook for each week, but people who aren't part of this group at Central Baptist shouldn't have much problem following the topics, as most of them ought to stand alone reasonably well. I'm not making it my purpose to necessarily try and teach what the lessons already do, but more explore tangents that I got interested in, having thought about things in the lessons.

#### ...Why? {#introduction-why}

If I'm thinking about the materials anyway, jotting things down to do research later, and then actually doing said research, writing it up in some form helps me capture it for the future just for myself, so I don't forget things. Sharing it publicly on the internet is a step past that, to be sure, but it's mostly because I'm doing it anyway.

Maybe other people will find it interesting too. That is the hope.

## [Does the Voice Agree with the Bible?](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-agree-with-the-bible) {#does-the-voice-agree-with-the-bible}

### Summary {#does-the-voice-agree-with-the-bible-summary}

In our examination of how to discern the voice of God, the natural and most important place to start is with the question of whether or not the voice agrees with the Word of God. Put simply, God will never lead us into anything that runs counter to His Word; any voice that does is not His. The Bible is perfect... although we need to be careful, because even though that is true, our understanding of it may not be! It takes spiritual growth to be able to know what it is the Bible actually says, so that we may use it as the measuring stick by which we evaluate all things.

This week's lesson starts on page 63 of the workbook, and was what we went through on 01/22/2023.

### [The Bible Is How We Know What Is from God](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-agree-with-the-bible/the-bible-is-how-we-know-what-is-from-god) {#the-bible-is-how-we-know-what-is-from-god}

#### Summary {#the-bible-is-how-we-know-what-is-from-god-summary}

Only through the Word of God can we properly identify God's voice -- only by submitting to Bible teachers and personally reading the Bible can we grow in such a way that we develop the discernment God wants us to develop, the discernment that will allow us to identify His guidance.

This is because for us to properly use the Bible as our measuring stick for everything, we have to know it inside and out -- to know its correct interpretation, not just its words. And how you get that is by reading it consistently and learning from a gifted and prepared Bible teacher who can explain it in a systematic and detailed way. Doing these things will help us grow spiritually, until eventually we will find that discerning God's voice becomes ever easier, because our minds have been transformed by His truth (compare Romans 12:2).

##### How do you recognize God's voice, as opposed to the voice of Satan and/or others under Satan's sway? Through the Word of God {#the-bible-is-how-we-know-what-is-from-god-how-do-you-recognize-god-s-voice-as-opposed-to-the-voice-of-satan-and-or-others-under-satan-s-sway-through-the-word-of-god}

As we went over this week, the primary answer to the question of "How do we know if a voice is from God?" is that God speaks to us through His Word. That Word is all about Jesus Christ, and He is Himself a message from the Father (that is, His life and what He did for us upon the cross); Hebrews 1:1-2a says that "In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by his Son."

It is no surprise that the written Word of God is all about Jesus Christ, the living Word (compare John 1:1-14). The two are inextricably linked. For this reason, if we want to come to know Jesus Christ (and that is, in essence, what we are all about as Christians), then *how* we come to know about Him is through the Bible. There is no other way -- none whatsoever. For the Bible is the very "mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16). It is -- quite literally -- the message that the Omnipotent Creator and Redeemer of the universe has seen fit to put into the hands of humanity. *That* is no small thing, aye?

Bringing us back to the point at hand, it is only through the Word of God that we will be able to properly "discern the Spirits" (1 John 4:1-3), and so correctly make out the voice of God from among the veritable chorus of false voices.

##### We must both submit to Bible teachers and personally read the Bible to grow in such a way that we develop the discernment God wants us to develop {#the-bible-is-how-we-know-what-is-from-god-we-must-both-submit-to-bible-teachers-and-personally-read-the-bible-to-grow-in-such-a-way-that-we-develop-the-discernment-god-wants-us-to-develop}

False things can sometimes be rather obvious (so, for example, the Bible does most assuredly *not* tell us that we as Christians are guaranteed to have lives of overflowing abundance completely free from suffering -- ever read John 15:18-21 and 1 Peter 4:12-19?), but they can also be subtle and much harder to spot.

Part of this is because Satan's lies often have at least a grain of truth in them. When Satan speaks to Eve in Genesis 3, he is not wrong that God forbade Adam and Eve from eating... but he does purposely misrepresent God's words. It is actually not all that subtle here (God forbade eating the fruit from a single tree, not all the trees), but how about in Matthew 4:1-11 during the temptation of Christ? Satan quotes scripture at Jesus. How can scripture be wrong? But Jesus quotes scripture right back at Him, showing that Satan's interpretation of what that scripture meant was faulty. Satan had twisted things, even though all he did was quote the Bible!

This introduces a major wrinkle: using the Bible as our measuring stick only works when we know what the *correct* interpretation of the Bible is. How then do we get this correct interpretation of the Bible? The basic answer to that question is that we must grow spiritually. And how do we grow spiritually? By listening to Bible teachers, and by reading the Bible ourselves.

The Bible says that God has put some in the body of Christ as pastor-teachers, and these men are specially empowered by the Holy Spirit to learn and then explain the Bible, "in order to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up" (see Ephesians 4:11-13). This means we can come to know what the Bible actually teaches by listening to these gifted and prepared individuals God has placed in the body of Christ to explain the Bible to us. Teaching the Bible is their primary job, so we ought to take full advantage of their gifts, for that is how things are supposed to work in the system God has designed: the Church, the united body of Christ here in the world, composed of various parts each fulfilling their respective role (see 1 Corinthians 12). In fact, to grow to spiritual maturity, we *must* submit ourselves to these Bible teachers; that is what the Ephesians quote from above demands, albeit indirectly.

Secondly, we all need to build up our own personal knowledge of the Bible by reading it consistently. For one thing, the matter of choosing which Bible teachers to listen to is impossible to do properly without us verifying that the words coming out of their mouths line up with the Bible (compare Acts 17:11). Even though this is the case, we are *not* authorized to think we can go it alone, and forgo the step of submitting to teachers. Instead, we *do* need to submit to teachers... but only the ones whose words we can verify with the Bible. To do this, we certainly need to be conversant with what the Bible says!

It's not just about getting us past that first hurdle of figuring out which Bible teachers to listen to, though. Let me try to use an analogy: let's say that the truth contained in the Bible is like a puzzle -- individual verses and passages are like puzzle pieces. The end goal is for each of us to have collected pieces of the puzzle (pieces of scripture), and have them "properly assembled" in our hearts, fitting together piece-by-piece to form a solid edifice of truth. If that is the goal, then what is the most effective way for this goal to be achieved? Is it to put the sole responsibility for our growth in the hands of our teachers? Do we think that will maximize our spiritual growth?

Is it not instead the case that we should do absolutely as much as we can on our own to make the process more effective? If we read our Bibles every day, we will be accumulating in our hearts more and more puzzle pieces, so to speak. Some of them we can probably fit together all on our own, but others we probably won't be able to (those are the ones we need Bible teachers for). Us taking the initiative to consistently read our Bibles greatly enhances the process, because then teachers don't always have to be re-explaining "what the Bible says" alongside "what the Bible means," but can instead mostly just focus on explaining how some of the trickier pieces fit together. It should be very obvious that the more familiarity people have with the Bible -- even if they are fuzzy on some things -- the more effectively they can understand Bible teaching, as a general rule. So, for example, if a teacher is teaching about the theological concept of Justification, he might work on explaining how James' description of faith being proved genuine by the fruit it bears in people's lives (compare James 2) does not at all contradict Paul's teaching that we are justified by faith, not by works (compare the end of Romans 3, particularly verse 28). This particular teaching will be more easily understandable and more useful for those who are already familiar with what these passages talk about, how they are situated in their respective narratives, and so on.

In short, reading our Bibles is our "homework" as Christians, so that when we show up to "lecture," we will be able to better follow the words of our teachers. If we neglect our homework, we will not learn nearly as well from our teachers, and if we do not learn nearly as well from our teachers, our understanding of what the Bible really means will be limited, and if our understanding of what the Bible really means will be limited, then we will be unable to effectively use the Bible as a measuring stick for everything (like how we are supposed to). Our discernment will be crippled, and we will not be nearly as successful in picking out the voice of God, instead being more likely to follow other voices we ought not. 

To wrap up this section, trying to learn from homework alone is no good -- if we are wrong, who will correct us? Who will answer our questions if we get stuck? That's why we need Bible teachers. But the point we have just been making is that trying to learn from lecture alone is no good either, because Bible teaching won't make much sense to us unless we are already familiar with the Bible -- the thing that all good Bible teaching should be singularly focused upon -- and no one but us can make us familiar with the Bible (through a personal choice on our part to read it consistently). So it is that we must *both* submit to Bible teachers and personally read the Bible for the process to work as God intends -- for us to grow spiritually, and therefore know the correct interpretation of the Bible, that we might be able to accurately discern the voice of God.

##### Conclusion and recap {#the-bible-is-how-we-know-what-is-from-god-conclusion-and-recap}

It is always through the Bible itself that we make our way through life, through its light that we know where to go (compare Psalm 119:105). And so it is that if we consistently read our Bibles, consistently immerse ourselves in the Bible's teachings, and consistently learn about the Bible from the Bible teachers whom God has placed in our lives, eventually we will build up an edifice of truth in our hearts -- truth fully learned, believed, and applied = *epignosis* ([ἐπίγνωσις](https://biblehub.com/greek/1922.htm)) rather than just "head knowledge" = *gnosis* ([γνῶσις](https://biblehub.com/greek/1108.htm)) -- such that we grow up in our faith, even to the point of spiritual maturity.

After this transformation of our thinking through the Word of God, this "renewing of our minds," we "will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will" (Romans 12:2), and will therefore "no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming" (Ephesians 4:14). This is the spiritually-empowered discernment God wants for each and every one of us, if we would but trust Him and make use of the tools He has given us in the Bible and gifted Bible teachers to help explain it.

Would that we would always let Him work in us as we ought! For if we would, never again would we struggle so to make out God's voice, but would instead come to joyfully listen for it, using the Bible to banish uncertainty and doubt from our minds.

### [Satan Is the Serpent of Genesis 3](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-agree-with-the-bible/satan-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3) {#satan-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3}

#### Summary {#satan-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3-summary}

When discussing the serpent of Genesis 3, it is natural to ask if this is Satan we are talking about here. There has been a certain amount of scholarship of late that has scoffed at Christians "reading the devil back into the Old Testament" (as they would phrase it) -- arguing that the specific being discussed in the Old Testament did not at time of writing have overtones of supernatural evil, and that it is only possible to view things that way by back-reading the New Testament. (This, they say, means that the Old Testament does not itself "support" viewing Satan as a supernatural adversary of God).

The issue with this sort of argument is that you could well say that Isiah 52:13ff. (the prophecy concerning the suffering servant), the virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14), and Psalm 22 (a Messianic Psalm) are in similar fashion "reading Jesus back into the Old Testament." Is that an appropriate attitude to take towards God's truth? Honestly, past a certain point, it is not worth our time debating with people who think it is unreasonable to interpret the Old Testament in light of the New Testament, since both are the Word of God. But in this discussion, we will nonetheless examine the personage of Satan in the Old Testament, and how we can identify the serpent of Genesis 3 with him. Even if it means we quote from the New Testament.

##### Is the serpent of Genesis 3 Satan? {#satan-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3-satan}

Regarding the main point of this week's teaching (the importance of the Bible in recognizing the voice of God), our Daily Discipleship Guide used the deception of Eve (as recorded in Genesis 3) as an illustration of how important the Word of God is in protecting us from falling prey to false voices. If Eve had stayed firm in God's actual words (remembering them and trusting them, even when challenged as to their reasonableness), the serpent's attack would not have found purchase. The mechanism for Eve's fall was, essentially, a failing in knowledge of and belief in God's Word = what God had told Adam and Eve at that time. (For us nowadays, the equivalent is the Bible, the written Word of God. That is God's revelation to us in our current so-called "dispensation" of the truth).

This is an excellent example of the Word's central importance in our discernment, no question about it. But tangential to this main discussion is that of the exact identity of the serpent in Genesis 3. Our Daily Discipleship Guide says "Though Genesis doesn't identify the serpent as being inhabited by the devil, Scripture later identifies the serpent with Satan (Revelation 20:2)."

This is in fact the correct interpretation (that is, that the serpent in Genesis 3 was Satan and/or was controlled by Satan), but exactly how can we go about establishing the evidence for this identification? Revelation 20:2 alone is a good starting place, but as we shall see, there is certainly more to be said, and this "more" is what we shall now explore.

###### Who is Satan, according to the Old Testament? {#satan-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3-who-is-satan-according-to-the-old-testament}

The word Satan ([שָׂטָן](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7854.htm) in Hebrew) is a noun meaning "adversary" or "accuser". Hebrew as a language uses so-called "triconsonantal roots" to form both nouns and verbs (and so on), and here the root is *Sin*-*Tet*-*Nun* (note that it is [*Sin* not *Shin*](https://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_One/Aleph-Bet/Shin/shin.html) -- hence "Satan" rather than "Shatan"). These same three consonants can also form a verb that in the simple form means "to obstruct" or "to oppose." So the meanings of the noun fit.

{{% technical-discussion %}}

The *Nun* in שָׂטָן is here word-final, and therefore in the [sofit form](https://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_One/Final_Forms/final_forms.html).

{{% /technical-discussion %}}

The Hebrew noun can be used without a definite article. So, for example, The Angel of the Lord (a Christophany = pre-incarnate appearance of Christ; *The* Angel of the Lord) opposes Balaam as "an adversary" [in Numbers 22:22](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/numbers/22-22.htm).

When used with a [definite article](https://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_Four/The_Definite_Article/the_definite_article.html) (הַ), however, the being in view (= הַשָׂטָן now that we have added the article, transliterated *ha-satan*) refers to the supernatural adversary of God.

This specific being is, somewhat surprisingly, not actually mentioned particularly frequently in the Old Testament. The *ha-satan* form is used in Job 1:6-9, 1:12, 2:1-4, 2:6-7 to refer to an angelic being in the court of God who accuses Job before God. It is also used in Zechariah 3:1-2 in a very similar manner -- a supernatural being leveling accusations. Some exegetes have argued for seeing these instances as an elect angel serving in a "divine prosecutor" sort of role, but the problem with that idea is the being's apparent antagonism towards both God and (for example) Job -- why would an elect angel be interested in trying to get a human whom God took pride in to stumble, in a seeming bid to prove God's words false? Moreover, Revelation 12:10 says that Satan is "the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night."

It is therefore theologically irresponsible to even entertain the possibility that the accuser mentioned in the Job and Zechariah passages is anyone other than Satan. There is no "literary development of the Satan character", no "Jewish legal conception of *ha-satan* improperly retconned by later Christians to be supernatural evil", no "borrowed characterization based upon literary parallels in other Near-East cosmologies." Regardless of what false things others might say (as additional examples, you might also see [here](https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2021/why-michael-heiser-is-probably-wrong-about-satan-in-the-book-of-job) or [here](https://academic.oup.com/book/38719/chapter-abstract/336896773?redirectedFrom=fulltext)), the accuser mentioned in the Old Testament has always been the devil -- a very real, very powerful spiritual force for evil, not some legal bureaucrat angel just doing his job -- even if people of the past may not have been as aware of him as we are today, now that we have received the New Testament. The greater nuance over time in our understanding of Satan's true nature is just so-called "progressive revelation" at work. (More on that in a moment).

There is one more Old Testament passage that interpreters typically take to be Satan proper (rather than a "small s satan" = *an* adversary generally, rather than *the* adversary), and that is 1 Chronicles 21:1. If you check the Hebrew, you might expect to find the definite article as with the other usages, but... [not here](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_chronicles/21-1.htm). For whatever reason.

The interpretation of this passage (1 Chronicles 21:1-6ff.) is rather vexing for multiple reasons. 2 Samuel 24:1-9ff. is directly parallel. 2 Samuel 24:1 says that *God* moved David to take the census, not an adversary (who we interpretively ought to take as the *the* adversary even despite the lack of definite article -- it's the only thing that makes sense). Isn't that a contradiction since 1 Chronicles 21:1 says that it was *Satan* who incited David?

It really isn't. For example, God states explicitly that He used Assyria to punish wayward Israel (Isaiah 10:5-7), and this Isaiah passage makes it crystal clear that God is using Assyria *despite* what Assyria (personified, or "the Assyrian" if you prefer) intends -- compare "this is not what he has in mind", verse 7. God is simply so smart (in fact, Omniscient) and so powerful (in fact, Omnipotent) that he can use evil people in His Perfect Plan, *and there's nothing they can do about it, no matter what evil they intend*. Like *ha-satan* in Job 1 and Job 2, evildoers can never do a single thing except that which God explicitly allows. They are dancing completely in the palm of His hand, to borrow a metaphor.

So, to reconcile 1 Chronicles 21:1 and 2 Samuel 24:1 only requires that you take the interpretive leap that God allowed Satan to incite David to take the census, that God *used* Satan. Satan was the agent; God was the architect. We might assume that Satan knew that taking the census would be a sin against God (for reasons we shan't get into here -- this is "the other reason" why the interpretation of this passage is vexing), and thought that getting David -- a "man after God's own heart" (Acts 13:22) -- to stumble would somehow damage God's plans (compare Satan's desire to trip up Job in Job chapters 1 and 2). This thought was, of course, utter madness... as sin always is. Satan, a mere creature, thought he could somehow successfully raise his hand against his Maker? What a joke. We may laugh at his foolishness, yet who are we to talk? We all sin (Romans 3:23, James 3:2), and our sin is just as insane for this very same reason.

Anyway... these are the Old Testament references to Satan. What remains to be established is how we know that the supernatural being referenced in these other places is the same as the serpent in Genesis 3, and that is to what we shall turn next.

If you'd like to read a second analysis of Satan in the Old Testament, you might have a look at [this page](https://renew.org/satan-in-the-old-testament/). I should note that I do not agree with certain things this page, but am just linking it because it covers similar topics, so may be good as a point of comparison.

###### On progressive revelation, and scriptural evidence for drawing the equivalency {#satan-is-the-serpent-of-genesis-3-on-progressive-revelation-and-scriptural-evidence-for-drawing-the-equivalency}

I shall dismiss a great deal of scholarship with a wave of my hand in this next sentence: that some scholars wish to say that there is supposedly "no evidence" that the accuser of Job and Zechariah is the same being as the serpent of Genesis (or even the being mentioned in Revelation 12) is neither here nor there in terms of it being actually true. You get rather used to this sort of thing if you have a lot of respect for biblical inspiration and inerrancy and substantially less respect for comparative mythology and literary criticism and other such pursuits that exercise the academy.

To elaborate a bit more on why we can be so dismissive: there is a concept in theology called "progressive revelation." It holds that God is not obligated to reveal to humanity all of His Plan all at once, but can space out revelation over time. So it is that when Jesus (the Messiah) came on the scene, the Jews were expecting a King to throw out the Romans, not the suffering servant of Isaiah 52:13ff. Jesus will indeed come in radiant glory to crush the enemies of Israel (as prophesied all over the place in the Old Testament -- which is from where the Jews got the idea of the Conquering King Messiah)... but not until Armageddon, at the *second* coming of Christ. It was not at all obvious to the Jews that there would even be a first coming, much less that its purpose was for Jesus to go to the cross as the propitiation for the sins of the world, bearing the iniquity of us all upon His blameless shoulders, taking God's judgement in our place as the Sacrifice of all Sacrifices.

But after Jesus was crucified, died, and was resurrected (thereby positionally defeating death and overcoming the grave), what had previously been a mystery was now revealed to mankind. Our salvation was won on the cross, redeeming sinful humanity to a perfect God once for all. That this was what God had meant all along only became clear *later*, not when the prophecies were initially written. Hence "progressive revelation."

This is relevant in our case primarily because of Genesis 3:15, the second part of the judgement against the serpent. The Hebrew word for serpent is *nachash* ([נָחָשׁ](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5175.htm)), and this is the common word for a literal, physical snake in Hebrew.

To sidetrack for just a moment, the fact that we are dealing with what appears to be a literal, physical snake has a couple interesting implications. First off, it is notable that Eve is not recorded as being weirded out by the fact that a snake is talking to her, which is itself noteworthy. It is also fantastic inferential evidence for the snake being supernaturally possessed by a spiritual being (i.e., a fallen angel -- cf. the demons possessing the pigs in Matthew 8:28-34). Why is that? Well, while we don't know exactly what language Adam and Eve and their offspring spoke (things obviously changed after the Tower of Babel -- it is likely Abraham spoke Hebrew, and then obviously his descendants did), unless snake physiology has somehow changed quite drastically (well, more than being cursed to crawl upon the ground, per Genesis 3:14), snakes cannot even form any human-like sounds to begin with. (Obviously).

You might take the position that God "allowed Eve to speak snake" (or animal languages generally). We have literally nothing to go on in terms of scriptural evidence one way or the other, so why not? Such a view does have the advantage that it would explain why Eve wasn't surprised when an animal spoke to her. On the other hand, you then have to deal with the fact that this ability certainly didn't persist. So was it revoked after the fall? Did it die out after Adam and Eve, even if they retained it for their entire lives?

While the above sounds like it would be an interesting premise for a work of fiction (and actually, cf. [Dr. Dolittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Dolittle) -- that's already a thing), the more realistic explanation, to my mind, is that Eve wasn't weirded out by the random communication à la snake because Adam and Eve probably spoke directly to not only God (that much we have directly from the text in Genesis), but also angels (that's more of an inference). After all, why not? We humans will certainly speak to angels when we share eternity together with them in the final paradise (the New Heavens and New Earth and New Jerusalem) -- so why couldn't Adam and Eve likewise have spoken to them in the initial paradise (Eden), as in the setting of this passage? If we assume that this communication with angels was actually something that happened, it follows that while Eve may have been puzzled as to why an angel had possessed the body of an animal (or maybe that part was normal enough too -- who knows?), the *really* strange bit about the snake speaking would be no major matter. That is to say, if Adam and Eve were already used to communicating with angels, then that clears up the interpretive question mark of the talking snake quite neatly.

More importantly, it supports a reading of the text that holds that the snake was possessed by an angel, not acting of its own accord as an animal. There are people who make this argument -- "Since the Genesis text only says *nachash*, it must really have only been a snake, nothing more and nothing less." I can't exactly disprove this directly -- as what I just went through is essentially just speculation on my part -- but the passage does make perfectly good sense if you hold that the snake was being possessed by a fallen angel (that is, Satan).

At any rate, back to progressive revelation and Genesis 3:15. Upon an initial reading it may seem like this verse is just a literal curse against snakes. After all, snakes do strike at our heels as humans, and we do crush their heads (that is, interpreted, we kill them). But why emphasize the seed of the woman then? Is that just a poetic way of saying "humanity in general?"

Perhaps. That's what the doubters say. But what is actually the case is that the "seed of the woman" mentioned in Genesis 3:15 is Jesus Christ, making Genesis 3:15 a prophecy. Jesus crushed Satan's head with his victory on the cross -- Satan has already lost! Satan is thus the serpent whose head is crushed.

We can keep going, too. Genesis 3:14 speaks of the serpent being driven down to the earth. That sounds an awful lot like Revelation 12:9.

The particular construct being used here follows the format "article > noun > article > adjective", putting the adjective in [the attributive position](https://books.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/obp.0264/ch16.xhtml#:~:text=Attributive%20position%20tells%20us%20that%20a%20noun%20is,road%20into%20attributive%20position%20with%20the%20noun%20woman.).

After those, καλούμενος is a participle and also in the attributive position, although this time just between the article and the proper noun Διάβολος. This is a different construct -- that is, "article > adjective (participle here) > noun" -- but has the exact same grammatical meaning.

Finally, we have the conjunction καὶ (and) and then an article and another proper noun in Σατανᾶς. Because of the coordinating conjunction, we are to take καλούμενος with ὁ Σατανᾶς as well.

Putting it all together, we then get "the great dragon, the ancient serpent, the one called the devil and Satan."

It might be a bit of a jump to identify the serpent of Genesis 3 with Satan just on account of "ancient serpent" being equated with "Satan" in Revelation 12:9 (cf. also Revelation 20:2), although that's strong enough all on its own. What really seals it is the parallel of being driven down to the earth.

Some people still somehow explain all this away... but, well, they explain away a lot, as you can see. Once you see the typological connections between Jesus and the seed of the woman who crushes the head of the serpent, Satan and the serpent whose head gets crushed, and Satan as the serpent driven down to the earth, the only reasonable course in interpretation is to accept the clear prophetic typology.

I should note that prophetic typology and dual-application is *super* common in Old Testament prophecy. For example, another dual-application passage typologically related to Satan is Ezekiel 28:1-19 (note especially verses 11 through 19). These words (at least many of them) applied to the literal King of Tyre (i.e., a historical human being), but the passage also very clearly shifts into talking about Satan, and what brought about his fall. We might also here note that once again Satan is said to be "thrown to the earth" (verse 17), fitting right in with Genesis 3:14 and Revelation 12:9.

I will close off this discussion by noting that properly interpreting things the way that we have laid out here makes Genesis 3:15 a powerful promise of Satan's defeat (because all prophecies of God truly are promises), alongside the promise symbolized by the so-called "protoevangelium" = "first gospel" (the animal skins God gave to Adam and Eve to cover their sin -- blood sacrifice provided by God to redeem them). When Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden of Eden, while they lost paradise, they were not left completely bereft, for God had *already* even at this point told them through these things (that is, the prophecy of Genesis 3:15, and the animal skins of the protoevangelium) that they -- representing humanity -- would always have salvation so long as they believe. Even despite the curses of the fall!

Even more importantly, all of this shows that God was not surprised by the fall. He is not reacting to Satan, remember? (Cf. again when God used Satan in the events of 1 Chronicles 21:1-6ff.). Quite to the contrary: Satan, being a mere creature, is actually just serving as a pawn in God's plan (despite the fact that he does not want this to be so), all the while inexorably marching ever onwards towards his inevitable defeat, his eternal destiny of being cast into the Lake of Fire forever.

So no, to reiterate again, God was not at all surprised by the fall. When God created mankind, the cross that very instant became inevitable, and He knew that. Before His first creative act, the Son (the second member of the Trinity) had already committed Himself to taking on weak human vesture -- eternally tying Himself to us -- and even more than that, committed Himself to living a life full of suffering, committed Himself to dying for the sins of the whole world, dying for the sins of all humans who ever have and ever will live. *It was planned from the very beginning*. Even knowing this, God created us anyway, thereby cementing the necessity of the cross, and the sacrifice of His Son. *That* is how much He loves us. We ought to always remember these astounding things, and the price that was paid to redeem us -- the price that Jesus willingly paid to save us, even though we are unworthy.

## [Does the Voice Bring Conviction?](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-bring-conviction) {#does-the-voice-bring-conviction}
{{< subjects >}}

### Summary {#does-the-voice-bring-conviction-summary}

In our examination of how to discern the voice of God, we started by discussing how God will only ever lead us on paths that agree with the Bible. Now we are turning to another point: the idea of conviction. Spiritual truth is spiritually known; the Holy Spirit convicts us of it in our hearts. But the Holy Spirit will not do the same for things that are false. So it is that if a voice is from God, we ought to be able to firmly commit ourselves to listening to that voice, without double-mindedness or cognitive dissonance. God calls us to peace, and while following Him will be far from easy, deep down in our hearts, we ought to be able to tell that we are doing the right thing when we pick up our cross and follow after Jesus.

The thing that complicates all this is that God doesn't force our hand, but allows us to harden our hearts, to lie to ourselves... and quite effectively at that. For this reason, emotional comfort is *not* itself enough. It's pretty easy to be satisfied with one's approach if you never read the Bible, for example, and only surround yourselves with friends who aren't even believers. They will tell you that your sin is acceptable, and you might then even come to believe it and be comfortable in your choice to wallow, without it paining you. But that sort of conviction is no good at all!

The trick is being able to have that easy confidence *when actually doing everything right*. You need to be convicted based on the truth of what the Bible says, not based on selfish human rationalization. If you can't have peace on a path when you spend time in the Word and in prayer about the matter -- if you can't have confidence when you truly put the matter in the Lord's hands -- then whatever it is you might think you have, conviction it is not.

This week's lesson starts on page 71 of the workbook, and was what we went through on 01/29/2023.

### [On the Human Capacity for Self-Deception](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-bring-conviction/on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception) {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception}
{{< subjects >}}

{{< /subjects >}}



#### Summary {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-summary}

In this week's lesson, we talked about how God's voice will convict us of the truth -- whether that means convicting us of sin, or giving us bold confidence to pursue a path of action that is necessary to pursue God's plans for us. Being able to act with the confidence of doing the right thing is a great blessing.

Yet, one need not read much history at all to come to the conclusion that many, perhaps even most humans act with great conviction, yet clearly act against God's truth. What then is godly conviction? It cannot just be a "feeling" divorced from the truth, because if it were merely having confidence of one's correctness, then all these people who think themselves right would not in fact be dead wrong. Just look at the Pharisees.

No, quite to the contrary. Godly conviction is less about emotion than it is about the truth -- knowledge that one is obeying the scriptures and acting in accordance with the commands of God. It is rooted first and foremost in understanding of the Bible and spiritual growth. For example, you must grow spiritually to develop the discernment necessary to have conviction about what ministry God wants you to perform (for every one of us has a job to do in the body of Christ; compare 1 Corinthians 12).

The operative point we will be examining on this page specifically is the idea that we *must* be on guard to to ensure that we do not deceive ourselves and act contrary to the truth. By examining passages that outline the human capacity for self-deception, it should be clear to us that we must always be checking our confidence against the Word of God, and tossing it out as rubbish if we realize it does not line up. Otherwise our conviction -- strong as it may be -- will only be getting in the way of what it is God actually wants us to do -- what *He* would actually convict us of (rather than whatever we have convicted ourselves of), if we would but open our hearts and minds to His truth.

##### Example verses concerning the idea of human self-deception {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-example-verses-concerning-the-idea-of-human-self-deception}

###### The deceitfulness of the human heart {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-the-deceitfulness-of-the-human-heart}

To start of with, how about a cheery verse discussing the nature of the human heart?

{{% ot t="esv" p="Jeremiah 17:9" h="300px" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Jeremiah 17:9 | NIV84" %}}
The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?

A human heart is more dishonest than anything else. It can’t be healed. Who can understand it? 
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /ot %}}

We have no basis for trusting our own hearts. We are indwelt by the sin nature, as all humans have been since Adam (excepting Christ; part of the reason why the virgin birth is important). We are, down to a person, biased by the flesh. If we were witnesses taking the stand, we have already been tampered with, already taken a bribe.

Consequently, we ought not trust our own judgement any further than we can throw it. We ought to instead only trust the Word of God, which the Holy Spirit will use to convict our hearts of the truth, if we would but choose to listen to Him rather than charging ahead and dictating to God.

###### General example verses about self-deception {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-general-example-verses-about-self-deception}

But if we don't choose to listen, the Bible is very clear that we can deceive ourselves. It is far from impossible.

###### Self-deception can even apply to salvation {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-self-deception-can-even-apply-to-salvation}

{{% nt t="esv" p="Matthew 7:21-23" h="400px" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Matthew 7:21-23 | NIV84" %}}
**21** “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. **22** Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ **23** Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’
{{% /scripture-h %}}

{{% scripture-l p="Matthew 7:21-23 | NIrV" %}}

Get away from me, you who do evil!’
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /nt %}}

Many people don't like talking about these verses. Uncomfortable subject, this. Who wants to think about the chilling fact that not all Israel is Israel (Romans 9:6-7)?

Yet there are those who engage in something that they call Christianity that will nonetheless end up in the Lake of Fire forever, for the only thing that is important is believing in who Jesus was and what He did for us on the cross by taking the penalty for our sin upon His shoulders. God is Just -- He offers salvation to all, gives all an equal chance to respond to Him. Literally all we have to do is not say no! But He does not ever make exceptions or excuse unbelief. Not even for people who outwardly adopt the title of Christian and engage in things that society thinks are good, like giving money to the poor.

How can people who spit in God's face by rejecting the Son He sacrificed on their behalf then turn around and consider themselves Christians and children of God -- even consider themselves and their group "better Christians" than other Christians (cf. cults)? That's human self-deception. That people can redefine salvation to be a set of legalistic works *and then actually believe it* ought to terrify us. Not because our own salvation is imperiled when we come to this realization (we are saved so long as we actually believe in Jesus Christ -- end of story), but because it ought to thus be obvious to us that humans can in fact lie to themselves to such a degree that they get something as important as salvation by grace through faith dead wrong, all while being completely blind to it. *They think they are right*, legitimately believe it. But they are not.

###### Self-deception runs on human arrogance {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-self-deception-runs-on-human-arrogance}

{{% nt t="esv" p="Revelation 3:17" h="300px" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Revelation 3:17 | NIV84" %}}
You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
{{% /scripture-h %}}

{{% scripture-l p="Revelation 3:17 | NIrV" %}}
‘You say, “I am rich. I’ve become wealthy and don’t need anything.” But you don’t realize how pitiful and miserable you have become. You are poor, blind and naked.
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /nt %}}

Human arrogance is such that we all fail to recognize our own pitiful state; we all overestimate how much we have it together, and underestimate how much we need God. The Church of Laodicea in Revelation 3 typifies this pattern of blindness, but it applies in greater or lesser measure to all Christians. It is more than possible for people to think themselves upon the right path while in fact not even being close. The point is that we must never forget this truth, but must instead turn it upon ourselves reflexively to make sure that anything that we think and believe has the Word of God behind it, rather than human rationalization and self-deception.

##### The Bible would not have verses about examining and testing ourselves if it were not important {#on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception-the-bible-would-not-have-verses-about-examining-and-testing-ourselves-if-it-were-not-important}

Consider these verses:

{{% scripture-h p="2 Corinthians 13:5 | NIV84" %}}

**28** A person should take a careful look at himself before he eats the bread and drinks from the cup. **29** Anyone who eats and drinks must recognize the body of the Lord. If he doesn’t, God will judge him for it.

Let’s take a good look at the way we’re living. Let’s return to the Lord.
{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /ot %}}

It makes no sense for the Bible to speak of us testing and examining ourselves unless it was possible for us to be deceiving ourselves.

Does this mean we ought to always be fearful of "not really believing?" No. If we believe, we believe, and that is that. We need to have confidence in that. If we want to actually believe something, we do. We can't mess it up like that; we *do* have free will.

But nothing will protect us from believing the wrong things, or actual unbelief. That free will cuts both ways. This is why we must always test ourselves against the scriptures to make sure that we really are holding to God's truth, not some straw man version of it we have set up in our hearts. For, as we have just seen, it is more than possible for us humans to lie to ourselves so effectively that we completely blind ourselves to the truth, even though we claim we have it. Would that we would care enough to study the truth so that we might not be those people!

### [We Ought Not Have Unrealistic Expectations about Spiritual Conviction](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-bring-conviction/we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction) {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction}
{{< subjects >}}

{{< /subjects >}}



#### Summary {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-summary}

One of the most natural questions to ask when the topic of spiritual conviction comes up, in my opinion, is the question of exactly what matters it typically applies in, and how far it goes. Are we given a wealth of detailed guidance, or only the barest hint of an outline as how we ought to order our behavior? Which extreme is the reality of the situation actually closer to?

It is a good question, for if we spend lots of time with an ear to the ground, listening for answers about things that God will in no way give us specific guidance on, at best we waste our time, and at worst we will come to listen to some voice that is *not* from God. So it does make sense to discuss the topic of exactly what conviction means for us as Christians, and whether we should regularly expect it in our lives. This page will set out to discuss such things.

{{% toggleable-content %}}

#### Content {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-content}

<!-- --- -->

##### Overview {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-overview}

For most matters in life, the Bible doesn't give us specifics. Generalizing a bit, God tells us what is important writ large, but does not give us anything like direct verbal answers to every little thing we have to make decisions on. Figuring out how to map spiritual truth onto the complex, messy situations before us in life -- that's something that falls to us. We get better at it as we grow spiritually -- that is, learning, believing, and applying more and more of God's truth.

Consider that this state of affairs does not come about because God could not provide us clearer answers for all the things we ask. He is Omniscient and Omnipotent. So, given verses like Matthew 7:7-8, why doesn't He just instantly give us those answers, firm feelings regarding which path to take?

Well, who are we to say that it would be better for us to actually immediately get such answers and conviction for all our matters of discernment? If we believe Romans 8:28, no matter what happens, God is working all things out for our ultimate (spiritual) good. In fact, it is the best -- the superlative is appropriate. The Plan of God is completely perfect. So if we don't get any firm answers from God as to exactly what we ought to do about some specific thing, it is no accident.

Nowhere does Romans 8:28 say that we will understand God's plans most or even much of the time. When you think about it, the reason for such is kind of obvious. We are incredibly finite beings with perspectives warped by our own sinful flesh and Satan's world system trying to turn us away from God at every turn. Even the most spiritually advanced among us are still just puny humans. Who are we to talk to back to God? Do we really think we know better than Him now, hm? Perhaps we feel that we are *owed* guidance. That it is somehow our due. But just as a parent cannot always explain their complicated reasons to their whiny indignant four-year-old (even if they wanted to), so to does our blind human perspective pretty sharply limit God's ability to share with us the real reasons behind things in life.

This case might perhaps feel like one of those that is fundamentally incomprehensible for that reason, but it really isn't as incomprehensible as all that. Put simply, God doesn't immediately answer every decision we put before Him like some sort of divine magic eight ball because He views the development of our faith as more important than our temporal gratification. If God were to answer our every question instantly, where is there room for faith on our part in that? How then could God perfectly work every single thing out right under our noses -- even better than we could have ever imagined or prayed for ourselves -- thereby demonstrating His perfect faithfulness... if we would but trust Him, trust that He has it all in hand?

So it is that we are left down here to struggle with limited perspective and imperfect information in order to demonstrate exactly how much we really do trust the Lord. He will always come through for us -- maybe not in a way that maximizes comfort or wealth or any other ephemeral material parameter, but in a way that maximizes our spiritual wellbeing -- but we have to have faith and wait upon Him. That is much the point, in fact.

##### This does not mean that God does not give us enough information to do what we ought {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-this-does-not-mean-that-god-does-not-give-us-enough-information-to-do-what-we-ought}

Put quite simply, we are always given enough information to make the decision we ought. These two propositions are not identical:

- God gives us all the information we need
- God gives us all the information we need to be so confident in our path that things will be crystal clear, without having to take difficult steps of faith

No matter what decisions stare us down (college major, career, who to marry, how to deal with difficult family relationships, what to focus one's ministry efforts on as an individual calling, etc. etc.), if we actually trusted God as we ought, we could always "get it right." Always.

So never ought the excuse "but I didn't have enough information!" cross our lips. Enough information for what?

For example, let's say you come to decide that you need to change you major after already being in college two years. Seems like wasted time and money, right? But what happens if God has some greater plan at work here? What happens if you might use that information you now think is fall-through in some way in the future? How do you know that such a thing for sure won't happen?

Or maybe you really were being selfish and hardheaded in pursuing the earlier major, and you finally got your act together and started listening to God's prodding that had been there all along. That's possible too, sure. *It actually doesn't matter*. The past is in the past. We just need to not get resentful and blame God. Either He has His reasons, or we we failed to listen as we ought. We'll probably never know exactly what combination between these things (and others besides) truly explains "the why." The point is that God always gives us everything we need to follow Him as He wants us to. If we make a mess of it, then that is on us, not Him.

Emphasizing this is important because the very worst thing we can do is make excuses for ourselves and blame God. If it seems to us like we prayed and prayed for guidance only to end up on a bad path that we had to backtrack on later ("why couldn't you have just pushed me in this correct direction in the first place when I asked!"), things didn't happen that way for a reason, one way or another, and that reason is never because God is unfairly stingy in His guidance.

###### The principle is in fact absolute {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-the-principle-is-in-fact-absolute}

Very often the toughest matters of discernment are matters of application wherein there is no global absolute to go on. Sometimes people fancy themselves clever for having come up with some hypothetical thought experiment that seems to defy any possibility of knowing the "right answer."

But if we pray earnestly, no matter how bad our intel, we can still always do what God wants of us, given where we are. We always have that potential. Even if some of these challenging hypotheticals were to actually come about for us personally (and that is sometimes not even remotely realistic), well we can properly answer all such things when we actually face them personally and pray for guidance, relying on the Holy Spirit that indwells us. We must have faith in that.

##### But, again, having all we need to follow God's Will is different from it always being clear and dead obvious {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-but-again-having-all-we-need-to-follow-god-s-will-is-different-from-it-always-being-clear-and-dead-obvious}

Conviction is a spectrum, and we have no guarantees about where all matters in our life will fall, as we have just been discussing.

Blessedly, we can have rock-solid conviction about many things. For example:

- God loves us, loves us so much that He sent His only Son to take the penalty of our sins in our place.
- Our sin -- no matter how dark a stain it may truly be -- has been paid for and wiped out. If we but confess and mean it, that is it. It was already nailed to the cross with Christ, so God has justified legal basis for now declaring us clean, so long as we rest in the blood of His Son.
- As long as we believe, nothing can separate us from God and His love (cf. Romans 8:38-39) -- for now, and forever.
- Everything that happens happens for a reason, maximizing the ultimate spiritual good of all (Romans 8:28).
- Etc.

In fact, everything the Bible truly teaches we can be rock-solid on. The problem is that there is plenty in life that is not directly addressed in the Bible. What to do then? Well, we can certainly avoid the extremes:

- On one side, we should avoid getting improperly preoccupied with "getting conviction" on every minute decision in our life -- majoring on the minors. God probably doesn't have grand spiritual guidance on which brand of paper towels to buy, for example. You probably ought to just pick one and get on with doing the spiritual things he actually wants you to do!
- On the other side, while it true that being overmuch enthusiastic about making all minor decisions matters of spiritual life and death is going to open you up to all sorts of problems, being too closed to the spiritual dimension behind reality is a very perilous approach too. We need to always evaluate things on the eternal spiritual plane, not the ephemeral material one. We shouldn't waste lots of our time endlessly praying about minor nothings, yes, but we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that all of our decisions have spiritual implications, will all come together to echo for us throughout eternity. We always need to be listening for God's Will in our everyday decisions too, because everything in this life for us as Christians ought to revolve around God's Will -- for the world generally, and for us specifically.

Perhaps all of this is seems unsatisfying, leaving things vague and far from parsed out in a clear set of rules and principles. Welcome to life -- grey and messy.

##### Sometimes conviction comes stronger with time, but sometimes not {#we-ought-not-have-unrealistic-expectations-about-spiritual-conviction-sometimes-conviction-comes-stronger-with-time-but-sometimes-not}

To close us out, it is worth noting that it is not uncommon to better understand things with some 20/20 hindsight -- for stronger conviction to come *after* we find ourselves halfway down a path, not when we first find ourselves at the fork. I personally have a couple examples of this phenomenon from my own life:

- Transferring universities to learn Greek and Hebrew to prepare for a role in Bible teaching
- Studying for and then working a day job as a software engineer rather than going through seminary, ending up in academia, or following some other career path.

It was not until I was months down these paths that things crystallized into full certainty in my mind. When I was forced to make the decisions in the moment -- through much prayer -- I honestly was not confident that I was not making mistakes in both cases. But over time God opened my eyes to things that had been hidden before, things that gave me a level of peace and certainty that I hadn't had at the beginning.

We cannot always expect this across all situations though. Sometimes that process of difficult faith and persistent lack of answers may drag out rather than getting resolved in a few short weeks or months. No matter what, we just need to trust that settled emotions or not, if we are doing everything we can to learn, believe, and apply God's Word to our lives (and keep in constant prayer about it all too) -- if we are doing everything that we are supposed to -- that God will work things all out perfectly. As Christian soldiers upon the battlefield of this life, we can keep our heads down and let our commanding officer handle all the rest -- for there is no greater commanding officer than Jesus Christ.

### [The Momentousness of Acts 2](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-bring-conviction/the-momentousness-of-acts-2) {#the-momentousness-of-acts-2}

#### Summary {#the-momentousness-of-acts-2-summary}

This week, our Workbook examined the idea of conviction through the lens of Acts 2:32-41. This is the end of Peter's address to the crowd at Pentecost.

These verses present an example of how conviction works in practice. First, the truth is presented (vv. 32-36). Then the people, upon hearing the truth, are convicted of its truth... and thus indirectly, are convicted of their mistake in crucifying their own Messiah (v. 37)! Their realization of the truth naturally leads to them to the question of what they should now do based upon this truth; true conviction always demands response on our part. Finally, Peter answers this question (v. 38). When God convicts us of something, he never leaves us in the lurch, but always gives us the direction that our response must take. (If we ask for it and truly want it, at any rate).

Hopefully all this (which our lesson in the Workbook covered -- more or less) is clear enough. But this page, instead of focusing upon these main points, will instead briefly examine a couple contextual points that may throw into relief the true importance of this day in Church history, and the poignance of thousands of Jews all at once becoming aware of their past blindness, and collectively being pierced to the heart. It's powerful stuff.

##### Acts 2 is really when the Church takes off numbers-wise. It represents a massive change in scale {#the-momentousness-of-acts-2-acts-2-is-really-when-the-church-takes-off-numbers-wise-it-represents-a-massive-change-in-scale}

Acts 1:15 states quite clearly that the number of believers at that time numbered around 120. Contextually, the "they" of Acts 2:1 is this group (we get this from the third person plural ending on ἦσαν combined with the fact that there is no noun in the sentence to directly serve as a subject -- since the subject of "were all together in one place" is not stated directly in the sentence, the subject must come from earlier).

So those who spoke in tongues in the first part of Acts 2 were the people making up this small group of initial believers, the very first people in the New Testament Church. It is somewhat startling when you consider how many people congregated around Jesus when He did miracles and taught the crowds. Thousands were touched by his ministry, yet just a few dozen are gathered soon after His resurrection and ascension. We do not know exactly how many of those Jesus had sent out before (e.g., Luke 10:1ff.) were part of this group, so it is possible there were more godly people who were not present in Jerusalem at this time, for whatever reason. One might also consider some of those from the Samaritan village who had believed (John 4:39-42), for example, among other individuals or groups mentioned throughout the gospels (like the centurions of Matthew 8:5-13 and Mark 15:37-39, who perhaps were not able to leave their posts to be together with the other believers). We needn't get overly fixated on the precise number; the point is that the overall number of people starts out startlingly small.

This is an important point to make given that after Peter's Spirit-filled speech at Pentecost, Acts 2:41 says that "about three thousand" (ὡσεὶ τρισχίλιαι) were added to their number. *Three thousand*. Whether the multiplier was actually a full 30-fold, or was perhaps a bit less than that overall, the point is that the change here is drastic, and would lead to fundamental and sweeping changes in the structure and organization of the Church.

We should thus bear in mind whenever we talk of the conversion of these folks at Pentecost exactly how massive a thing this day was. It represents, in many ways, the day the Church was truly born. For while there were believers before Pentecost, Pentecost marks the coming of Holy Spirit and beginning the Church Age as a distinct phase of human history.

##### Many of these new converts were the very same people who may have clamored for Jesus' crucifixion {#the-momentousness-of-acts-2-many-of-these-new-converts-were-the-very-same-people-who-may-have-clamored-for-jesus-crucifixion}

Consider again Acts 2:36-37 (also cf. v. 23). In context, it clear that the thing that really pierced many of Peter's listeners to the heart was the realization that they had crucified the very Messiah that they had been waiting for for hundreds of years!

In some ways, this collective realization on the part of the Jews prefigures the collective realization that will occur at the second return of Christ (Revelation 1:7, cf. Matthew 24:30), when Jewish people alive at the second coming will recognize the Messiah returning in glory, and once again collectively turn to Him:

{{% quote text="Ichthys" src="https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part1.htm#Revelation%201:7:" %}}

**every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him**: The dramatic return of our Lord will be visible to everyone on earth. Singled out for special mention are His kindred people, Israel, in the phrase "those who pierced Him", referring to the episode at the cross as predicted by Zechariah (compare Jn.19:34-37 with Zech.12:10; cf. Ps.22:16). This is a description of an instantaneous repentance and conversion of the Jews alive at the Second Advent when they witness the return of the Messiah as explained by the apostle Paul (Rom.9-11): the "hardness in part" that has characterized the majority of the descendants of Abraham since the 1st Advent will dissolve instantly upon the Messiah's return. 

{{% /quote %}}

Of course, we Gentiles are now part of the Church as well. But in these cases -- both past and future -- there is something decidedly *right* about God's chosen people turning to Him *en masse*, a dramatic show of collective repentance. In much the same way as the prodigal son returning home, the things out of place will be set to rights, as the separation between Israel and the Church will be completely torn down, never again to rise. For we will all then be truly one in Christ, forever. Israel, after millennia of hardness, will have finally come home, joining us at the feet of the Father.

At any rate, the upshot for our passage here in Acts 2 is that this event hits hard on account of exactly who it is being convicted. It was not some group of people who had never heard of Jesus who were so stirred by Peter's speech that they put their faith in Him. Instead, the crowd here was composed -- at least in part -- of the very Jews who had pushed for Jesus' crucifixion (or if not that, had nonetheless not opposed it when Jesus was turned over to Pilate in a mockery of Justice).

So, again, we need to view this account of mass conversion at Pentecost as something a great deal more important than a bunch of random people being converted. For it marks the repentance of many Jews, who would go on to become the backbone of the very early Church as it expanded outwards from Judea to encompass the Roman Mediterranean. Those who had set themselves against God's Son came to realize the truth, and decided to be born again, throwing themselves upon the Mercy of the very one they had betrayed. It ought to give us chills, even today.

### [Conviction Is Not Based upon Emotion, but upon the Truth ](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-bring-conviction/conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth) {#conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth}

#### Summary {#conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth-summary}

In an earlier discussion page from this week, we examined the fact that it is [completely possible for human beings to deceive themselves and yet be completely unaware of such](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-bring-conviction/on-the-human-capacity-for-self-deception/). I did not particularly break out the root causes of self-deception there, but it turns out that there are a couple different umbrella categories.

On the one hand, some people lie to themselves by twisting scripture: pulling things out of context, improperly limiting or expanding the scope of things based on false interpretations of perceived audience (e.g., some people in the present day say "Well, Paul only meant this to apply to the people in the time/culture he wrote to, not us!"), or even just picking the wrong interpretation of multiple possibilities based on less overtly incorrect (though still incorrect) reasoning. The key word here would be "rationalization." These folks still base the evidence for their positions on the Bible, they just have such faulty presuppositions -- or do such violence to the text itself, hermeneutic principles, logic, or some combination thereof -- that their "Bible-supported position" is in truth nothing of the sort.

On the other hand, others lie to themselves by making it all about how they feel, minimizing the role the Bible itself plays in their beliefs. Arguing with such people is very difficult, because emotion/experience is not directly falsifiable. If someone says "I feel like God has told me that I ought to 'speak in tongues' when I pray," well, you can't have much of a debate about 1) what "speaking in tongues" means to begin with (e.g., in Greek, the word [γλῶσσα](https://biblehub.com/greek/1100.htm) refers to a real language, not babbled nonsense -- cf. Acts 2:4-12), and 2) whether this practice is something that God still empowers even in the modern day. Both things are simply presupposed based upon how the other party "feels," with emotion put forth as the last word on the matter.

Of course, many times, people believe things that are false due to a veritable "cocktail" of rationalizations and presuppositions and mental gymnastics. These things are not necessarily mutually exclusive with each other, in other words. Nonetheless, on this page, we are going to briefly examine just the relationship between emotion and conviction, and make a case that true conviction is based primarily upon the truth as contained in the Word of God, not emotion.

##### Why emotion alone is a faulty basis for establishing spiritual truth {#conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth-why-emotion-alone-is-a-faulty-basis-for-establishing-spiritual-truth}

Put simply, human emotions are fickle. They are not consistent enough to draw conclusions from; any conclusions that people *do* try to draw from them are not repeatable or generalizable.

There really isn't a great deal more to it than that. For anyone who is truly honest with themselves, it ought to be obvious that our emotions don't always track perfectly with the truth, at least not initially. For example, most people have a very positive emotional response regarding God's love and grace, and not nearly so much positive emotional energy when it comes to actually putting in the hard work of daily Bible reading and taking in Bible teaching in order to grow to spiritual maturity.

To be clear, this does not mean that we need to be utterly against emotions as Christians, or try to stifle them, as if they are necessarily evil. Emotions are part of being human (cf. John 11:33-36). There is nothing inherently wrong with them, *per se*. We can be joyful when we have occasion to be joyful, and mournful when we have occasion to be mournful. We can laugh, and cry, and feel outrage at evil conduct. We do not need to try to somehow *not* feel these things.

The point is simply that our emotions ought not be in the driver's seat, but us. The truth is a thing independent from them. When our emotions line up with the truth, well and good. But if they do not, well, best go with the Bible, not our emotions.

###### Example: Facing down the wind and the waves {#conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth-example-facing-down-the-wind-and-the-waves}

In Matthew 14:22-33 Peter starts walking out to Jesus upon the water, but when he saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink.

The Lord of the Universe had just told Peter to come out to Him. What did Peter have to be afraid of? Yet he was afraid nonetheless... because it was an emotional reaction, not one based on the truth. His emotions told him that he was in trouble, that nature's fury would overcome him. And, believing them, he earns a soft rebuke for his lack of faith.

My purpose in bringing up the example of Peter's reaction here is this: it is common for our initial emotional response to events to be particularly untrustworthy. If we keep throwing truth at our emotions, eventually they'll get back in line. But if we let them rule us, we will be like Peter, and find ourselves sinking beneath the waves, even though God is so much more powerful than any storm could ever be.

This is why *following* our emotions (rather than *leading* them) is dangerous.

###### Example: Joy in suffering {#conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth-example-joy-in-suffering}

As another example, the Bible directly tells us to rejoice when suffering comes upon us (compare Romans 5:3-5, James 1:2-4). But is that really what humans tend towards, our initial emotional response?

If you want a persuasive yet short argument against the idea of basing much of anything at all upon our emotions, one good option would be something like: "The Bible commands us to look to the spiritual -- seeing how testing grows our faith -- in order to have genuine joy amidst suffering. The initial emotional response to intense suffering, common among all humans to one degree or another, is decidedly *not* joy. Therefore, our emotions cannot reliably be used to drive our spiritual outlook, QED."

The natural response we feel when finding ourselves in the middle of suffering is dismay, not joy. As we grow more mature, we definitely will get better at looking to the unseen spiritual dimension in order to bolster our attitude and square our shoulders like good Christian soldiers -- in order to snap out of our emotion-induced pity party that much faster. The more we believe 2 Corinthians 4:17 -- *really* believe it -- the less phased we will be by the temporary afflictions of the world. But we will still probably always have to wrestle our feelings in line at least some, to get back our peace and joy when things really get tough.

##### Emotional conviction vs. spiritual conviction {#conviction-is-not-based-upon-emotion-but-upon-the-truth-emotional-conviction-vs-spiritual-conviction}

The Holy Spirit operates upon the truth in our hearts. The more biblical knowledge we store up in our hearts (from reading our Bibles and taking in Bible teaching from gifted and prepared Bible teachers -- from growing spiritually), the more "spiritual capital" the Holy Spirit has to work with within us.

For us to become spiritually convicted about something, the Holy Spirit operates by means of this truth. This is why our spiritual discernment grows as our knowledge of the Bible grows; the two things are intrinsically linked.

Hopefully all this makes it clear why emotions have no part in true spiritual conviction. Emotions are simply not involved on *either* side of the equation. This means that they are, more or less, a red herring when it comes to what we ought to think, say, and do. The truth is the truth; it doesn't care if we feel good about it, if we feel downright lousy about it, or if we are somewhere in between. We still have a duty to accept it and obey it, no matter how we might feel.

By way of contrast, emotional conviction operates independently from the biblical truth stored up in our hearts, and independent from the Holy Spirit's prompting. Without God's Word and the indwelling Holy Spirit coming together to shine light on our path, why would we expect emotional conviction to be worth much of anything at all? Seems obvious, right?

Yet, even so, it is still difficult in the moment to keep this in mind, and keep ourselves from getting caught up by the tide when it sweeps over us. Being able to resist -- to hold firm to the truth, no matter how strong the waves of emotion -- requires spiritual growth on our part, and lots of it.

So once again, growing spiritually (by consistently reading our Bibles and taking in Bible teaching from gifted and prepared teachers) is our answer, the answer as to how to deal with emotions in a godly way. You will seldom ever be wrong in guessing that spiritual growth is the ultimate answer to some problem we might face as Christians, and this case is no exception.

## [Does the Voice Call You to Trust God?](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-call-you-to-trust-god) {#does-the-voice-call-you-to-trust-god}

### Summary {#does-the-voice-call-you-to-trust-god-summary}

We humans have an unfortunate tendency to only trust in that which we can see right before our eyes. Those are things that are safe, things without as much risk and uncertainty. Maybe trusting in these things seems wise; after all, as the saying goes, "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." But consider... these are also paths that don't require much faith. If we can do it all on our own, what need have we for God? On the other hand, sometimes taking the road that seems to have an infinite number of unknowns -- the road blocked by thorny hedges and landmines (as it were) -- is not exercising godly faith in choosing a path that requires us to lean on God, but is instead exercising foolishness in picking a path that is obviously the wrong one. Yet... knowing the one from the other requires spiritual growth. See a pattern in these lessons? Spiritual growth -- as accomplished by consistently reading our Bibles and listening to our Bible teachers -- is basically the answer to all problems, if we would just deign to do it as we ought.

In this week's teaching, we went over how God's voice will challenge us to trust Him. There is no growth without stretching those faith muscles, and that usually means that we will somehow have to trust God and put it all in His hands rather than relying on our own abilities. This life for us Christians is in truth all about faith and how far we are willing to push it, and we would do well to remember that truth when the road forks before us. The world will insist that the path of career success, material prosperity, financial stability, "keeping up with the Jones's," and so on is certainly the one that we ought to take -- even earning it with our own hands, according to the great American dream. But if we are only willing to trust in our own hands, then how can God work great things through us according to *His* power? He can only work fully through those who submit themselves to Him and trust in Him, not themselves.

So voices that don't demand faith of us probably aren't from God, because it is only through exercising faith -- that is, through leaning on God's power not our own -- that Christians can really do most of what we are actually called to do.

This week's lesson starts on page 79 of the workbook, and was what we went through on 02/05/2023.

#### Summary {#faith-is-not-irrational-summary}

In this week of our study, the Workbook used Hebrews 11:1-6 and Hebrews 11:13-16 in its discussion of how another variable in determining if a voice is of God is if it calls us to trust God, to exercise faith.

Hebrews 11 starts off with a definition of faith: "faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." This page will examine this statement, especially as it relates to the idea that having faith is not somehow illogical, despite not having "proof" in the sense that science-focused skeptics want.

##### The translation of Hebrews 11:1 {#faith-is-not-irrational-the-translation-of-hebrews-11-1}

{{% nt t="greek" p="Hebrews 11:1" h="300px" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Hebrews 11:1 | THGNT" %}}
Ἔστιν δὲ πίστις ἐλπιζομένων ὑπόστασις, πραγμάτων ἔλεγχος οὐ βλεπομένων.
{{% /scripture-h %}}

{{% /nt %}}

This sentence is not that complex grammatically. The core sentence is "ἔστιν πίστις ὑπόστασις... [ἔστιν πίστις] ἔλεγχος". This is a normal "{subject} {linking verb} {complement}" construction, with the only twist being that there are two complements, but without a coordinating conjunction between them (that is, there is no καί between ὑπόστασις and ἔλεγχος). The subject and linking verb are thus implicitly understood to go with both complements: "faith is assurance... [faith is] conviction."

[Ichthys' translation of this verse](https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm#Hebrews%2011:1-2) -- "It is faith [in the Living and written Word], moreover, that substantiates what we hope for. [Faith] provides proof of things unseen" -- doesn't mirror the exact grammatical structure as much, using indirect statement in the first bit (i.e., "it is faith... that").

Arguably, Ichthys' translation that translates with verbal phrases (that is, "faith substantiates... faith provides proof") adds clarity, but on the other hand translating more literally (that is, "faith is assurance... faith is conviction") works fine too. The meaning is clear either way. 

{{% /technical-discussion %}}

##### Analysis of Hebrews 11:1 {#faith-is-not-irrational-analysis-of-hebrews-11-1}

"Things hoped for" have not yet happened. How can you prove that they even will happen?

"Things not seen" are not before us. How can you prove that they even exist?

For us as Christians, our confidence in things that haven't happened yet comes from faith, as does our confidence in things that we cannot see (the spiritual realm). This is what Hebrews 11:1 says, in essence.

We *cannot* prove that prophecy will play out how God says it will with science, or verify the promises He makes us about eternity with science. We also *cannot* prove the existence of the spiritual realm with science, as it cannot be observed or measured like the material world.

This is because science (at least the epistemologically-sound variety, rather than the wild scholarly speculation that is rampant within some fields like evolutionary biology and the branch of theoretical astrophysics concerned with the creation of the universe) by its very nature only deals with the material world that can be subject to observation and experimentation. Metaphysics is simply outside its purview, or at least it ought to be.

All of this is a natural conversation to have when talking about Hebrews 11:1, because while Hebrews 11:1 doesn't say in so many words that there is no other way (that is, aside from faith) to have assurance of things hoped for or conviction of things unseen, it is very much an inference we are supposed to make.

Why is this important? Well, because it tells us that...

##### Faith is necessary, not illogical {#faith-is-not-irrational-faith-is-necessary-not-illogical}

It may seem incredibly obvious, but faith is actually 100% necessary for us to believe what we must as Christians. Let me repeat that: faith is *necessary*. Christianity without faith is no Christianity at all.

The fundamentals of Christianity largely center around who Jesus was (fully God yet fully man), what He did for us upon the cross, and how He was resurrected from the dead. Respectively:

- How could one "prove" that Jesus is God according to observation strictly of the material? You might make the argument that Jesus' miracles proved his divinity, but Pharaoh's magicians in Exodus 7-8 did miracles too (presumably somehow through the power of demons, whether that was full demon possession or not), and the false prophet in Revelation is also said to have miraculous power (compare Revelation 13:11-18 -- the false prophet is distinct from the beast per Revelation 16:13; 19:20; 20:10, and is somewhat like a cheerleader for the beast, albeit one having great power of his own).
- What's more, how could any human actually "prove" that Jesus paid the price for all human sin upon the cross, facing the fiery judgement of God in our place? That's definitely what the Bible teaches, but how do you prove that with science? You just can't; the very idea is nonsensical. Because the judgement happened *spiritually* when Jesus was physically hanging upon the cross.
- And finally, in the modern day, it is simply impossible for us to test or verify observationally whether Jesus was truly resurrected from the dead. We cannot have video evidence or what have you. It's just impossible.

The points being brought up here are sorely lacking in many discussions about faith and science. Christians are made to feel like they are uneducated and ignorant for having faith, that faith is somehow illogical. But science can say exactly nothing about whether Jesus paid for human sin when upon the cross, for example. Literally the only way to take a position on that proposition is through faith. Even if you wanted to do things "the science way," it is simply not a possibility.

The thing is, God never demands that we believe things that contravene reason and logic. That most people in the world have deceived themselves into thinking that Christianity actually does contravene logic (e.g., they'll say that evolution contradicts Genesis) is neither here nor there. It matters not what other people think or how many of them think it (see the logical fallacy of [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)). It only matters what is in fact true.

Where I am going with all this is that we cannot even "prove" (in the scientific sense, according to observation of and experimentation with the material world) that Jesus was God and that He fully paid for human sin upon the cross and that he was subsequently resurrected from the dead -- the very most fundamental points of Christianity. If we have confidence in these things, that confidence comes 100% from faith and 0% from material evidence. It is thus no surprise that everything else in Christianity largely follows suit -- the "things hoped for" (such as future promises of our eternal home) and the "things not seen" (such as the spiritual battle being waged all around us) all rest upon faith. And the vast majority of them are scientifically untestable propositions.

##### Define "illogical" {#faith-is-not-irrational-define-illogical}

Certain materialists take the epistemological position that any claims that are made absent supporting scientific evidence ought not to be believed. I will readily grant that under the presupposition that this material world is all there is, this is logical. The issue is, that's a presupposition, not a logically necessary fact. If you presuppose instead that the spiritual does exist, then suddenly talking about about spiritual matters is far from illogical.

The subtle thing that happens in arguments is that people sneak in their presuppositions as fact. How can you scientifically prove that God *doesn't* exist? You can't, if God is spiritual rather than material, and we humans can only measure the material. In terms of formal logic, this is purely "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." In like manner, you also cannot scientifically prove that Goes *does* exist. Because again, God is spiritual rather than material, and we humans can only measure the material. We can infer his existence (cf. the so-called "God of the gaps" argument), but that is not scientific proof.

Atheists base all their reasoning on the proposition that God does not exist... despite us just saying it is impossible for them to prove such scientifically! They will readily point out that we do the same thing in presupposing that God does exist. And yeah, we do. But *we* acknowledge the presupposition and call it faith. *We* don't pretend our positions are scientifically provable, but instead readily acknowledge that they are not. The difference is that their position is not one whit more scientifically provable, yet they do not similarly acknowledge the fact that their belief that God does not exist actually has no scientific basis. Even though they won't admit it, theirs too is a faith-based position, a presupposition.

Let me put it this way: what is illogical is asserting that scientifically untestable propositions *must* (by logical necessity) be true or false "because science", whichever direction you make the black and white claim. This is illogical because treating things that are not decidable by science as decidable by science is illogical.

Christians do *not* do this because, while we view our belief as true and correct, we don't base our confidence in spiritual things on scientific premises, but instead freely acknowledge that our belief rests upon presuppositions that we hold by faith. That our faith picks up where science leaves off, rather than contradicting it.

##### Final comments {#faith-is-not-irrational-final-comments}

Faith is not just a hunch or something. When we believe things the Bible speaks to, it needs to be absolute, as sure to us as the fact that we draw breath into our lungs. God's truth, as contained in His Word, is more sure than everything else in the world.

Even if science can't prove God created the universe from nothing, well, science can't prove that God *didn't* create the universe from nothing either, can it? People can't run experiments with a controlled randomized trial that has a great enough sample size of universes to ascertain whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (e.g.). At best, the astrophysicists can hypothesize based upon the limited evidence available to them. Sometimes their current hypothesis might actually contradict what the Bible says. Well, what of it? The thing about most of the things that trouble materialists (e.g., *ex nihilo* creation, the ark and worldwide flood in Genesis 6, the virgin birth, etc.) is that there is no way for them to formally disprove these things. *They weren't there*. And there are many possible explanations for how things could perhaps end up looking XYZ way to us in the future, yet somehow be misleading at the same time.

The point of all this is that the skepticism of others regarding the Bible's claims needn't make us feel ashamed of our faith. For we don't believe what the Bible says because of empirical scientific evidence; that is going about faith all wrong. We believe it because the Bible says it. That's all there is to it.

The point I have been trying to make here is that, practically speaking, all those things that atheists have issues believing are no problem whatsoever; their smear campaign against faith is completely toothless, if one takes the time to consider things rationally. The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is a violation of natural law, to be sure. But what is that to the God who created and sustains the universe, the architect of said natural law?

That's just one example, someone might say. Well then, what of Jonah and the fish (how does a man survive underwater for days when humans cannot breathe underwater)? What of God protecting Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the flames of the fiery furnace (how can human beings stand in a furnace and yet not at all be burned or harmed)? If an Omnipotent God external to spacetime exists, these things are perfectly plausible and not at all illogical to believe -- such a God would be more than able to accomplish them. It's just that without having faith in even that most basic proposition, the truth of all other spiritual matters will be veiled from people's eyes, and seem like so much nonsense (cf. 1 Corinthians 1:18). In this way, faith is everything, *everything*, in this life. And we ought never forget that.

## [Does the Voice Align with God's Character?](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-align-with-gods-character) {#does-the-voice-align-with-god-s-character}

### Summary {#does-the-voice-align-with-god-s-character-summary}

Our Workbook uses Exodus 34 (particularly Exodus 34:6-7) to help illustrate the character of God. The voice of God will always align with His character.

This is one of the more straightforward connections to make in this series on recognizing the voice of God, honestly. That is because this method of discernment works exactly the same between humans: knowing someone's character can instantly let us judge claims about them. "Would person X really say that? Is that consistent with their character?"

Unlike humans though, God's character is completely unchanging. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8; cf. Malachi 3:6). Humans can put on masks, can lie, but scarier even than those truths is that human character can *change*. As goes the famous quote from Lord Acton, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men..." Even the most idealistic can become the very thing that they had initially set out to reform. It happens all the time. And the hopes that others pin upon them are trampled and betrayed.

But, by way of contrast, God will never let us down. According to Exodus 34:6-7, not only is God perfectly just, but He is also incredibly loving. We know this because the Bible says it. This is not the only passage in the Bible that speaks to God's character, of course, but it is useful as it does put up rails on both sides. On the one hand, God loves us so much that He sent His one and only Son to take the punishment for our sins in our place. But on the other hand, God will not tolerate iniquity, not in the slightest. Any time we are trying to make out the voice of God, we can immediately throw out any voice that goes too far in either direction.

So, for example, we know that voices of guilt are not from God, because God loves us so much that He paid for our sin while we were yet sinners (Romans 5:8). He doesn't want us to be weighed down and crushed by sin. But we also know that voices of complete tolerance and acceptance are not from God either. God requires belief from us, and true belief *always* bears genuine fruit of repentance (cf. James 2, John 15). Sin is never OK to make peace with, no matter how vocally certain parties in our culture might shout that it is so.

If we take the time to come to know God, to understand His character through the process of spiritual growth (reading our Bibles and taking in Bible teaching from gifted and prepared Bible teachers), then in time we will have an ever easier time discerning what it is God wants us to do, since we will know what will and will not please Him, based upon who He is.

This week's lesson starts on page 87 of the workbook, and was what we went through on 02/12/2023.

### [Did Moses Do Wrong in Throwing the First Set of Tablets?](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-align-with-gods-character/did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets) {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets}

#### Summary {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-summary}

In the Exodus 34 passage that the Workbook drew from this week, Moses brings a second set of stone tablets to God to write the Ten Commandments upon again. The first set of tablets was broken by Moses in Exodus 32:19, when "his anger was kindled" after he came upon the Israelites dancing around and worshiping the golden calf.

This page will examine whether this destruction of the first set of tablets reflects poorly upon Moses or not, insofar as it is actually something that we might be able to know.

##### A simple formulation of the question {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-a-simple-formulation-of-the-question}

Consider Exodus 32:16 and Exodus 32:19.

In Exodus 32, Moses receives tablets written upon by God himself, containing the Ten Commandments. (On that identification, [see here](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-align-with-gods-character/what-is-going-on-in-exodus-34-27-28/#it-was-in-fact-the-ten-commandments-written-upon-the-stone-tablets-full-stop)). However, when "his anger was kindled" after he came upon the Israelites dancing around and worshiping the golden calf, Moses threw them, and they were broken.

Put simply, is this action by Moses disrespectful toward God, given that these tablets came directly from the hand of God? Did Moses lose his head in anger, and destroy God's gift?

We'll be examining this question from several angles, and ultimately conclude that while it's hard to be completely certain and dogmatic, it is likely that if this itself were truly such an affront against God, it would probably have been made clear somehow in the text.

##### On the nature of Moses' apparent anger {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-on-the-nature-of-moses-apparent-anger}

###### There is no such thing as "righteous anger" in the sense some people think there is. But having emotions coursing through our veins is not completely within our conscious control, so...? {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-there-is-no-such-thing-as-righteous-anger-in-the-sense-some-people-think-there-is-but-having-emotions-coursing-through-our-veins-is-not-completely-within-our-conscious-control-so}

This is not at all a simple concept to understand; it is incredibly easy to tie oneself into knots trying to wrap one's head around where the all the lines are here. There are several reasons for this (although these are probably not the only ones/an exhaustive list):

- Ephesians 4:26 is commonly misunderstood and misinterpreted
- The cleansings of the temple by Jesus are commonly misportrayed in popular imagination. To put it somewhat cheekily, Jesus may have overturned the tables of the money changers and driven them out of the temple, but He was not necessarily (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
- Another thing commonly misunderstood is that the "Wrath of God" is so-called "anthropopathism" -- that is, an attributing of human emotions to God to help us better understand Him, even though God is not actually human with human emotions. This means that using the argument "but God gets angry, and God obviously doesn't sin in doing so because God cannot sin, therefore it is possible to be angry without sinning, QED" is not quite what it seems, since God does not actually "get angry," *per se*.

The following links (some from me, some from [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/)) may hopefully help explain some of the complexities in all these matters:

- [On Ephesians 4:26](https://ichthys.com/mail-In-your-Anger-do-not-Sin.htm), and [More on Ephesians 4:26](/questions-and-answers/self-generated/does-ephesians-4-26-teach-that-there-is-a-form-of-righteous-anger/)
- [On the Wrath of God and anthropopathism](https://ichthys.com/mail-Sin-Atonement-ForgivenessII.htm#anthropathism)
- [More on anger and anthropopathism](https://ichthys.com/mail-anger-anthropopathism-eternity.htm)
- [More on anger as a sin](/questions-and-answers/reader-correspondence/on-the-emotion-of-anger/)

If all that is too much, a somewhat shorter summary version will now follow. First of all, we have directly in scripture that "man's anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires" (James 1:20). There is no qualification there -- no "man's *improper* anger" (as opposed to "non-sinful anger," whatever exactly people mean by that).

Anger is an emotion like other emotions we have. We humans do not always have the good fortune of being able to completely control what feelings swell within us. What we *are* always capable of, however, is choosing how we respond to them.

Let us take lust as a different (but basically parallel) example. If a man sees a beautiful woman walk by, he may -- not by such conscious choice, but just inherently -- have his physical body (the flesh, the sin nature) respond in a certain way, as a consequence of her beauty. In his mind may come the realization "Wow, she is absolutely stunning." Has he sinned? Let me rephrase that: is temptation sin?

Temptation is not sin. But giving into it (in any way whatsoever) most assuredly is. If a man indulges his attraction -- not just acknowledging it, but courting it, even if just in his heart -- lines have been crossed. And so too here; anger is really no different. If a flare of intense displeasure shoots through us, the ball is put in our court. What we do after that makes all the difference.

In this way, it is in fact true that it is possible for people to have the physiological responses associated with anger (eyes afire, nostrils flaring, etc.) while not yet actually falling prey to the sin of anger. Their heart is being bombarded with "anger temptation signals," but so long as they keep a lid on it -- so long as they keep the reigns firmly in their own hands, rather than letting the emotion take control -- things do not cross from temptation into sin. The physical symptoms are there though -- scientists would no doubt call you "angry" if you register the elevated blood pressure and elevated heart rate and so on associated with the biological state. But when intense emotion swells within us, these responses happen whether we consciously choose them or not (to a degree -- what we think *does* very much matter too, as it affects the intensity of our responses and how quickly we can get them under control).

For example, I imagine most of us would have boiling blood in confronting exceptionally gross evil. Be it the sexual abuse of underage girls, the gross oppression of orphaned refugees, or whatever other morally bankrupt crimes one might consider, coming face to face with the perpetrators is not likely to happen without our bodies reacting strongly, in a way that is largely outside our conscious purview. Where the rubber hits the road is what happens after that. Do we deck them in the face, beat them to a pulp? Do we yell and shout and rage? Or do we keep ourselves more in check?

Whatever we do, it must be entirely under the control of the Holy Spirit. And completely losing our temper means we are not under His control -- full stop. There are various basically-synonymous expressions for this phenomenon:

- "Losing it"
- "Losing one's cool"
- "Flying off the handle"
- "Snapping"
- "Exploding" or "blowing up"
- "Seeing red"

In all cases, the fundamental aspect is loss of control. If we lose our temper, we are not in control of our thoughts, words, and actions, but anger is. And there is no way to lose control without sinning in the process.

While this is perhaps popularly viewed as a black and white phenomenon (e.g., the difference between someone remaining silent vs. losing it by shouting and cussing another out), it is in truth really more a spectrum, and that's what makes evaluations here so thorny, and why giving even an inch to the emotion of anger is so dangerous. Thinking, speaking, or acting "from anger" in even the smallest aspect is still loss of control (and therefore problematic), even if it is more localized, and therefore not as bad is it "could have been."

Why all this gets so confusing is because it probably sounds an awful lot like I am arguing for a concept that some would wish to call "righteous anger" -- along the lines that feelings of anger you do not consciously indulge are alright/not sinful, since we can't fully control them even if we completely wanted to. The reason I am so very skittish of assenting to that label is that that label always strikes me as fishing for an excuse. Positionally, we should strive to not feed the beast *whatsoever*, as much as it depends upon us. Giving into feelings of anger "because it is possible to experience anger righteously" is not much different from "lighting a cigarette but not inhaling." It is playing with fire, and rife with rationalization.

###### To summarize {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-to-summarize}

- Our bodies' physical reaction to events is partially (although not completely -- it is complicated in the way the psycho-physical mind-body interface always is, with our thoughts and mental state affecting our physical biology and vice versa) outside of our control. This means we may register physiological signs of anger when emotion swells within us in response to intense external stimuli, without necessarily consciously choosing anger in a manner that would indicate sin.
- Giving into anger means thinking, speaking, or acting "from it." This means we have lost control (even if only a bit) -- putting anger in the driver's seat, rather than retaining control ourselves. And *that* is always sin.
- It is impossible to "use anger as a motivator" or nurse it within one's heart or whatever without courting it consciously. This is why making noises about "righteous anger" is dangerous, given what people usually mean by that. Taking fire into one's lap is never the right answer.

###### The text of Exodus 32:19, and what it can tell us about this situation of Moses breaking the tablets {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-the-text-of-exodus-32-19-and-what-it-can-tell-us-about-this-situation-of-moses-breaking-the-tablets}

Per our above discussion, the question is whether the anger kindling within Moses here is something that he consciously chose or not. Per the grammar, this is not an active construct (i.e., it does not read "he kindled his anger", but instead "his anger was kindled"). But did Moses at all "fan the flames" within his heart?

Ultimately, we really can't tell from the text itself. Since it is so difficult for humans to experience intense negative emotional stimuli with perfect application, it is perhaps reasonable to assume that maybe Moses let all this get to him a bit more than he should of. But that is still a far cry from taking the position that he completely lost his cool and threw a hissy fit, contrary to propriety. Could you take the passage that way? Maybe. But you could just as well *not* take it that way. Either seems to me to be possibly textually.

##### So if we can't make out details about his anger from the text itself, what else can we use to determine whether or not the throwing of the tablets was problematic? {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-so-if-we-can-t-make-out-details-about-his-anger-from-the-text-itself-what-else-can-we-use-to-determine-whether-or-not-the-throwing-of-the-tablets-was-problematic}

Most of the rest of our discussion here will be a bit indirect, and decidedly less than dogmatic.

###### The fact that God does not ever call Moses out for the destruction of the tablets {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-the-fact-that-god-does-not-ever-call-moses-out-for-the-destruction-of-the-tablets}

Between when Moses broke the first set of tablets in Exodus 32:19 and when the process of acquiring the second set of tablets was started in Exodus 34:1ff., there is no statement like "And the Lord was angry with Moses, given that he had destroyed the tablets upon which the Lord Himself had written."

In fact, while God was very displeased with the Israelites (and Moses was very displeased with them too), there doesn't seem to be a single statement that suggests that God was angry with *Moses* throughout the events of Exodus 32-34. Of course, absence of evidence of God's displeasure here is not *necessarily* evidence of absence, but it is nonetheless a reasonably strong inferential argument in favor of taking the position that the breaking of the tablets here was not problematic.

We have other instances of God rebuking Moses, strengthening the argument further (i.e., because if God corrected Moses in these other contexts when He did wrong, why would He uniquely not do the same here?).

In Exodus 4:14ff., God becomes displeased with Moses due to his reluctance to lead due to his lack of eloquence. God most certainly lets Moses know then.

And perhaps an even better cross-reference for the present situation -- since it also involves Moses being intensely displeased with the Israelites, and "doing something" in that state -- is Numbers 20:1-13. The passage doesn't say it directly, but by inference (cf. "Listen you rebels!" in v. 10), Moses' temper had flared here, frustration with the whiny, rebellious people overcoming him. Rather than following the exact instruction of the Lord as given in vv. 7-8 (that is, speaking to the rock), Moses instead struck the rock with his staff (v. 11).

This action alone -- one act of disobedience -- is enough for God to bar Moses from entering the promised land (v. 12 -- also cf. Deuteronomy 3:23-28)! The exegesis as to why this was so serious and meriting such severe punishment is somewhat involved and we won't get into it here, but the point is that God certainly did not hold back in punishing Moses when he acted improperly.

We might note that nothing of the sort happened in Exodus 17:1-7 -- a very similar story of the people whining due to lack of water, God telling Moses how to receive water from a rock, and then them subsequently getting water. But unlike in Numbers 20 when God commanded Moses to speak to the rock (but Moses struck it instead, against God's direction), here in Exodus 17 God actually did command Moses to strike the rock. And when Moses did, God did not rebuke him; he had obeyed God.

The upshot for us is that these other examples (Exodus 4:14ff., Numbers 20:1-13) provide indirect evidence that Moses did not do wrong in Exodus 32:19 by throwing the tablets (or at least did not do wrong enough for a rebuke relating to it to end up in scripture). Can we be certain? Not really. But indirect evidence is evidence too.

We might also consider Exodus 32:31-35. The only sin mentioned is that of the people. This would have been a very logical place for Moses to receive discipline or rebuke from the Lord if he too had done wrong, but there is nothing mentioned here. Arguably, vv. 32-33 is the strongest, for if Moses really had sinned against the Lord, it would be strange for this exchange to go in this manner were that the case.

###### The symbolism behind the tablets being destroyed {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-the-symbolism-behind-the-tablets-being-destroyed}

Here's an argument someone might use to argue that Moses breaking the tablets was a bad thing:

- Why would it be God's desire for the tablets to be broken, then needing to be remade again?
- Anything that contravenes God's desire is wrong/sinful
- Therefore Moses did wrong in Exodus 32:19

Whether or not this argument means anything rests entirely upon the first premise, for the second premise is obviously true, in some form at any rate (cf. Romans 14:23).

Now, we don't necessarily have to prove that it *was* God's Will for the tablets to be broken to make the situation less than black and white. Instead, all we have to show is that it *might have been* His Will.

To that end, consider that there is dead obvious symbolism in the tablets being destroyed when the Israelites turned away from God in their actions with the golden calf. If the tablets symbolically represented the covenant, and the Israelites severed the covenant right from the get go here in their idolatry, then the tablets being shattered makes perfect sense. One might even go so far as to say that it would be odd if the covenant God was giving them (and the tablets symbolizing it) stayed intact given what went down. (Although of course the covenant stayed in place many later times the Israelites turned to idolatry, so there is that).

We needn't be dogmatic about whether the tablets shattering was truly supposed to be understood in this symbolic way. Personally, I find it very likely, but I don't teach it dogmatically. The point is that it is perfectly logical and *could* be the case, which means the first premise of argument above could potentially be false, making the conclusion less than certain.

###### Moses' apparent closeness to God throughout the events of Exodus 32-34 {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-moses-apparent-closeness-to-god-throughout-the-events-of-exodus-32-34}

Reading Exodus 32-34 ought to make it clear that Moses was close to God all throughout this period.

Perhaps the clearest verses we have are Exodus 33:11, 17. If God spoke to Moses "face to face, as one speaks to a friend" (v. 11) and tells Moses that He is "pleased with him, and knows him by name" (v. 17), then on what basis would we we take the destruction of the tablets in Exodus 32:19 as being problematic/some form of serious sin? It just doesn't fit the immediate context here.

God showing Moses His glory in Exodus 33:12-23 is an extraordinary blessing given to Moses -- far from a minor thing. Again, this blessing simply doesn't fit if Moses had just previously done something substantially wrong, such that he would have angered God.

##### Conclusions {#did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets-conclusions}

While I do not believe we can know the exact nature of what happened in Exodus 32:19 and Moses' internal heart state at that time, I do think given the weight of evidence, we can be reasonably confident in saying that Moses' throwing of the first set of tablets was not some sort of grave slap in the face to God... certainly not like the Israelites' idolatry was, at any rate. Moses was outraged at the Israelites awful conduct, just like God was. This was in fact an appropriate response. 

My own personal hypothesis, in line with the [above general outline of the mechanics of anger](/longer-topical-studies/central-baptist-winter-2022-2023-how-to-discern-the-voice-of-god/does-the-voice-align-with-gods-character/did-moses-do-wrong-in-throwing-the-first-set-of-tablets/#there-is-no-such-thing-as-righteous-anger-in-the-sense-some-people-think-there-is-but-having-emotions-coursing-through-our-veins-is-not-completely-within-our-conscious-control-so), is that Moses had all the physiological responses to the situation that one might expect ("steam coming out of his ears," so to speak), given the seriousness of the Israelites' sin. But as we discussed in that linked section, having fire in your veins does not necessarily mean you sin. It's what you do with all those feelings that matters.

To some extent, we shouldn't get overly fixated on trying to figure out whether actions taken by people in narrative parts of the Bible (in the Old Testament and New Testament both) were right or wrong, and past that, how right or how wrong. Some of that is between those folks and God, and only knowable by those parties.

It's not bad to ask questions though, trying to puzzle out what happened and why; it can enrich our own understanding of the narrative. Hopefully this page has been helpful at least along those lines.

#### Summary {#what-is-going-on-in-exodus-34-27-28-summary}

In our passage this week, the Workbook focused on the character of God as described earlier in the chapter, Exodus 34:6-7.

This page, instead of focusing on those words, focuses on the writing: the writing God commanded Moses to do in Exodus 34:27, and the writing of the Ten Commandments onto the stone tablets in Exodus 34:28. For various reasons, getting a proper understanding of exactly what was written and who wrote it is a bit less straightforward than one might expect.

You should probably skip this section if you are not conversant or comfortable with incorrect but strongly-written academic scholarship about the Bible. It can be unsettling and difficult to argue against such scholarship, even if it teaches things that are dead false, as here.

{{% /cautionary-note %}}

Much to my surprise, I came across a page seriously questioning what was written on the stone tablets God gave to Moses: [the page](https://www.thetorah.com/article/what-did-god-write-on-the-tablets-of-stone). It waxes long and erudite about arguments and interpretations that challenge the traditional intepretation that God wrote the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) upon the stone tablets.

I had not previously know this was an area of any controversy whatsoever. Exodus 34:28, Deuteronomy 4:13, and Deuteronomy 10:1-5 seem to me to be so clear as to leave no doubt, and despite skimming the arguments within the linked piece, my views have not changed even the tiniest bit. I find it most unpersuasive, for all its veneer of rigorous analysis.

For example:

{{% quote text="the mentioned page" src="https://www.thetorah.com/article/what-did-god-write-on-the-tablets-of-stone" %}}

This interpretation, however, is problematic. The verse [Exodus 24:12] fails to explicitly mention עשרת הדברים “the Ten Words” or “words of the covenant.” Instead, it refers to התורה והמצוה, “the teaching and the commandment” (perhaps a hendiadys: “the legal teaching” or the like).<!--[^fn1]--> It seems quite odd, however, to refer to the Decalogue as “the teaching and the commandment” without any further clarification. How is the reader supposed to know that this phrase refers to the Decalogue?

[^fn1]: Some commentators assume that the "and" of our verse must be taken as an explicative: "I will give you the tablets of stone, *namely*, the teaching and commandment that I have written..." Another possibility is to take the *waw* in the sense of "with," and understand the verse as stating, "I will give you the tablets of stone *with* the teaching and commandment that I have written *on them*." The Samaritan Pentateuch reads התורה והמצוה without the *waw*, a reading likely implied by the Septuagint and Jubilees 1:1. This reading facilitates understanding "the teaching and the commandment" as an explication of "the stone tablets."

[^fn2]: I am assuming that the P references to העדות, לחות העדות, or ארון העדות follow D and reflect the understanding that the ark stored the Decalogue (עדות being P’s term for ברית). It must be conceded, however, that the P texts never state explicitly what was inscribed on the עדות, or even that this term consistently refers to tablets.

[^fn3]: There is absolutely no warrant, within the context of Exod 19-24:8, to take the words "And Moses wrote *all the words of YHWH*" (וַיִּכְתֹּב מֹשֶׁה אֵת כָּל דִּבְרֵי יְ-הוָה; Exod 24:4) as somehow excluding the Decalogue. Whereas Deuteronomy has the Decalogue on tablets, it seems clear that Exodus---at least in this verse---envisions them being written on a scroll along with the Covenant Collection.

[^fn4]: Verses 15b (or 16) – 18 are commonly assigned to P. The formulation, “brief tradition” is not meant to imply that these verses cannot be associated with others. On the contrary, the reference to tablets and to Joshua both here and at Exodus 32:17 would seem to imply an organic connection between the texts. On the other hand, the fact that Exodus 32 fails to mention either Hur or the elders renders the connection somewhat problematic. One might also consider the possibility (suggested by Marc Brettler, personal communication) that the words לוחות האבן in Exodus 24:12 were added by an editor [...] The words may have been added to foster the link with Exodus 32. This possibility is supported by the fact that no mention of tablets is found in the parallel text of 2 Kings 17:37 and by the fact that Exodus 31:18 also gives the impression of being an editorial link. In its original form, Exodus 24:12 could have referred to God writing the “Torah and commandment” either on tablets or in a scroll. If we follow this approach, the originality of the connection with Exodus 32 becomes very tenuous.

[^fn5]: As far as I can tell, it has not been noticed that Exodus 24:12 assigns Moses a priestly role of teaching the law (להורותם= the priestly task of יורו משפטיך ליעקב), which connects with the golden calf story that presents the Levites as those who win the priesthood, in opposition to Aaron.

Apparently, to the author, Exodus 34:28, Deuteronomy 4:13, and Deuteronomy 10:1-5 do not count as ways "the reader is supposed to know" that what God wrote on the tablets was the Ten Commandments. On what basis can we ignore the rest of the Old Testament?

As to the fact that it would not be known in the specific context of this passage, well, this is only a problem if one forces each passage to stand alone in interpretation, which is *never* how biblical interpretation works. It is a ridiculous and nonsensical standard to impose.

{{% quote text="the mentioned page" src="https://www.thetorah.com/article/what-did-god-write-on-the-tablets-of-stone" %}}

Furthermore, the formulation, "the tablets of stone and the teaching and the commandment that I have written *to teach them*" sounds as if something new is being given that must be taught. But Israel was already taught the Decalogue by God! Again, the formulation indicates that the tablets with their teaching (*torah*) were to be used by Moses to educate the people, as in "they shall teach your laws to Jacob and your Torah to Israel" (יוֹרוּ מִשְׁפָּטֶיךָ לְיַעֲקֹב וְתוֹרָתְךָ לְיִשְׂרָאֵל; Deut 33:10).

The "tablets of the covenant" with the Decalogue, however, are stored in the ark, far away from the public eye, and (at least according to P texts) serve as a *testimony* (hence: לוחות העדות) rather than as an educational tool (see Exod 25:16; 31:18; 40:20; cf. Deut. 10:1-5).<!--[^fn2]-->

{{% /quote %}}

(We are still focused on Exodus 24:12 here).

We do have a purpose clause here ("the teaching and the commandment I have written *in order to* teach them [the people]"). The problem is not with this observation, but with the interpretation of it.

Our author's argument goes something along the lines of "how can the tablets be said to 'teach the people' if they are locked up in the Ark of the Covenant?"

One would think, based on such an argument, that the physical tablets being in the Ark of the Covenant would somehow prevent the words upon them from being discussed or taught in the assembly. An interesting assumption, is it not? I'd like to hear some evidence for it, or otherwise any sort of explanation as to why where the physical tablets are stored matters when it comes to the things upon them being taught.

{{% quote text="the mentioned page" src="https://www.thetorah.com/article/what-did-god-write-on-the-tablets-of-stone" %}}

The sequence of events described above is almost certainly the result of a splicing together of two separate traditions. According to the longer tradition recounted (Exodus 20:1-24:11), God revealed the Decalogue to all of Israel (Exod 20), followed by the Covenant Collection to Moses (Exod 21-23). Moses then wrote all of them---the Decalogue and the Covenant Collection<!--[^fn3]-->---on a scroll and conducted the covenant ceremony (Exod 24:3-8).

The brief tradition in Exodus 24:12-15,<!--[^fn4]--> in contrast, reports of a *divinely* inscribed law on stone tablets handed over to Moses on the mountain for the instruction of the people.<!--[^fn5]--> It was originally unrelated to the account of the Decalogue and the Book of the Covenant that now precedes it.

Indeed, the formulation "come up the mountain" (עֲלֵה אֵלַי הָהָרָה) suggests that Moses is being called upon to go up the mountain to receive the law for the *first time*. Thus, our passage of Exodus 24:12 may be said to reflect a parallel and alternative tradition to that of Exodus 20-24:11.

About here is where I lose interest a great deal more. I have negative patience when it comes to the obsession scholars have with trying to identify "editorial traditions" and so on (cf. the so-called ["Documentary Hypothesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis) and the so-called ["Isaiah Problem"](https://rsc.byu.edu/isaiah-prophets/scientific-analysis-isaiah-authorship)).

With essentially non-existent actual physical evidence, scholars attempt to argue that parts of the Bible were written or compiled by multiple people having different authorial intents and styles and so on. Hogwash. One needs actual evidence to put forward assertions, not wild speculation. Especially for something so monumentally important as challenging the Bible's trustworthiness.

People who don't respect the Bible enough to trust it almost always draw problematic conclusions (as here). You shouldn't waste your time or energy listening to a single word these people have to say, for the most part.

And in that spirit, this is where I'll end my brief review of this idea that something other than the Ten Commandments was written upon the tablets. I am sure the piece I linked is not the only thing in the world that argues for a different interpretation than the normal one, but I do not think this is a question deserving of much serious discussion, for all who are content to take the Bible at face value.

You may read an email Q&A chain on Ichthys about this topic [here](https://ichthys.com/mail-bible-interpretation7.htm#:~:text=can%20you%20give%20me%20your%20opinion%20on%20the%20interpretation%20that%20the%20'tablet%20of%20commandments'%20given%20to%20moses%20is%20in%20exodus%2034%2C%20not%20the%20traditional%2010%20commandments%3F), if you'd like to see even more on the question.

##### The interpretation of Exodus 34:27-28 {#what-is-going-on-in-exodus-34-27-28-the-interpretation-of-exodus-34-27-28}

There are two matters of interpretation to wrangle here: what "these words" refers to in v. 27 (the two options are the commands of vv. 10-26 or the Ten Commandments), and who wrote on the tablets in v. 28 (the two options are God and Moses).

Admittedly, *prima facie*, taking vv. 27-28 as they are seems to say that God commanded Moses to write some things in v. 27, and then Moses obeyed and actually wrote the things he was commanded to write in v. 28.

There are issues with this, though.

First, the question of what "these words" are in verse 27. If one takes them as retrospective (vv. 10-26), the issue is that the commandments given in vv. 10-26 are *not* the Ten Commandments, which are thing things mentioned in v. 28. So that doesn;t seem to work.

Things work fine if you take the "these words" as prospective: "write down these things -- {list of things coming *after*}." But the problem with taking things prospectively is that v. 28 would then essentially logically mandate that we take Moses to be the subject of וַיִּכְתֹּב (since he is the one commanded to write in v. 27, which we are now prospectively tying with v. 28). In v. 28, this verb meaning "to write" does not have an explicit subject, so the subject must be inferred.

Moses being the subject is completely unworkable, even though it works fine grammatically. Why? Because Deuteronomy 10:1-5 states definitively that *God* was the one who wrote on the (second set of) tablets here, not Moses:

{{% ot t="esv" p="Deuteronomy 10:1-5" h="600px" %}}

**1** At that time the Lord said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden chest. **2** I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the chest.” **3** So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. **4** The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. **5** Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the Lord commanded me, and they are there now.

{{% scripture-l p="Deuteronomy 10:1-5 | NIrV" %}}

**1** At that time the Lord spoke to me. He said, “Carve out two stone tablets, just like the first ones. Then come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden chest. **2** I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you must put the tablets in the chest.” **3** So I made the ark out of acacia wood. I carved out two stone tablets that were just like the first ones. I went up the mountain. I carried the two tablets in my hands. **4** The Lord wrote on the tablets what he had written before. It was the Ten Commandments. He had announced them to you out of the fire on the mountain. It was on the day you had gathered together there. So the Lord gave the tablets to me. **5** Then I came back down the mountain. I put the tablets in the ark I had made, just as the Lord had commanded me. And that’s where they are now. 

{{% /scripture-l %}}

{{% /ot %}}

In the more immediate context, Exodus 34:1 also definitively states that God is the one doing the writing on the stone tablets, not Moses.

But if God is the one writing on the tablets, then the referent of "these words" in v. 27 cannot be looking forward to what is written in v. 28, but must be looking back to the commands that God gave in vv. 10-26. It is simply the only possible interpretation that "works" logically.

{{% technical-discussion %}}

God being the one writing on the stone tablets is in fact quite acceptable grammatically.

וַיִּכְתֹּב in v. 28 could have as its subject either God or Moses, given that the form is a 3rd person masculine singular imperfect Qal sequential. 3rd person masculine singular would obviously be right for Moses, but it is also the person/gender/number we would expect for God -- cf. when God is the implied subject of וַיֹּאמֶר in Exodus 34:10.

The וַיֹּאמֶר of v.10 is basically grammatically identical to the וַיִּכְתֹּב of our v. 28 (i.e., it is likewise a 3rd person masculine singular imperfect Qal sequential without an explicit subject), even though it comes from a different verb ([אָמַר](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h559/esv/wlc/0-1/) instead of [כָּתַב](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3789/esv/wlc/0-1/)). So if God can be the implied subject there in v. 10, he can also be the implied subject in v. 28. 

This is why we can say that it works fine grammatically for God to be the subject of וַיִּכְתֹּב in v. 28.

{{% /technical-discussion %}}

If your head is all a muddle now, in plainer English, all this means that after giving some commands (vv. 10-26) -- commands that are not the Ten Commandments) -- God tells Moses to write down all those commands he had just given (v. 27), probably on a scroll or what have you (i.e., something other than the tablets). Then God Himself inscribes the Ten Commandments onto the stone tablets (v. 28).

A clearer translation for these verses might then be:

{{% original-translation p="Exodus 34:27-28" %}}

**27** Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write down these words [I have just finished saying to you] (i.e., vv. 10-26), for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." **28** Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And [just as He said He would] (i.e., in v. 1), [the Lord] wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant — the Ten Commandments.

{{% /original-translation %}}

The reason why this interpretation doesn't necessarily jump out as being the right one at first blush is because Moses is a closer antecedent for the subject of וַיִּכְתֹּב in v. 28 than God is, and v. 27 and v. 28 both speak of similar things (i.e., commandments dealing with God's covenant), making it easy to equate the commandments mentioned in one verse with the commandments mentioned in the other. Equating the commandments is not logically necessary, however; it is also possible for both sets of commandments to be associated with the covenant, as well as everything else God said to Moses for these forty days and forty nights that was not captured in the commandments of vv. 10-26 -- that is, the ones God instructs Moses to write down in v. 27 -- *or* in the Ten Commandments God Himself inscribes in v. 28. This is in fact how I take things -- that all of it together is associated with the covenant God speaks of.

###### Trying to explain by extended analogy {#what-is-going-on-in-exodus-34-27-28-trying-to-explain-by-extended-analogy}

Let me give a sort of parallel example (that I've purposely made similar to our verses), to perhaps help illustrate things by analogy:

> John said, "healthy snacks include apples, celery, almonds, and hummus." Then John told Paul to write down his suggestions in a shopping list. Paul was with John for 30 minutes in the store. And he wrote down a shopping list with just pears and pecans.

Grammatically speaking, either John or Paul could be the subject of the last sentence, but most people would probably tend to take the subject as Paul, since he is a "closer antecedent," being the subject of the preceding sentence. In isolation (particularly if one interprets Johns "suggestions" as not directly referring to the things mentioned in the first sentence, but a new set of things = prospective rather than retrospective), some people might also take the shopping list of the last sentence to be the same one as the one mentioned by John a couple sentences before. They're both shopping lists containing healthy snacks, right?

To carry forward the analogy, let's say that David tagged along to the store with John and Paul, and the next day told his wife, laughingly, that John (that goofball) had written a shopping list with just two items on it (pears and pecans), because he is so used to his wife doing all the grocery shopping that he didn't even get everything he had needed to when he had first been sent to the store earlier in the day to pick up healthy snacks for the party he and his wife were hosting alongside Paul and his wife, meaning he had to tag along with Paul when Paul went later in the day, in order to buy what he had missed when he had previously gone on his own. The families were splitting hosting duties, so both husbands were sent to buy healthy snacks as their wives prepared the main meal together. John's family would be responsible for some snacks, and Paul's family for other snacks.

When a different friend, James is telling his wife the same story (having heard from the others), he uses the exact wording we started off with. That is:

> John said, "healthy snacks include apples, celery, almonds, and hummus." Then John told Paul to write down his suggestions in a shopping list. Paul was with John for 30 minutes in the store. And he wrote down a shopping list with just pears and pecans.

James' wife, frowning about it later that evening, texts her friend (David's wife from before) because she can't figure out who the "he" is. David's wife laughs and tells her it was John who wrote the tiny shopping list with just the two things in it.

This logically necessitates that Paul wrote a shopping list that contains "apples, celery, almonds, and hummus." He had just been asking John for suggestions on what to buy since he too was a grocery shopping neophyte. (Pfft, men, am I right?)

...Did that help at all? Hopefully it showed how things "work" both grammatically and logically if you interpret things in the way we did in our own situation vis-à-vis Exodus 34:27-28.
