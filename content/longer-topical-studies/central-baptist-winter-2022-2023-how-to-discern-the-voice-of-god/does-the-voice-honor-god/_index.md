## Summary {#summary}

This week, our Workbook took us through part of John 17, Jesus' prayer towards the end of the upper room discourse (which had begun in John 13).

Jesus prays for God's Will to be done. In John 17:1, He prays that the Son might be glorified, that the Son might then glorify the Father. It might seem an odd prayer, even self-serving... except in context this prayer is concerning the cross!

Think about that for a second. In a short time, Jesus was going to be arrested, questioned, beaten, and then crucified, all in a mockery of justice. He *knew* this, and yet what He is concerned about is not Himself, but the glory of the Father.

In John 17:4, Jesus then states that He glorified the Father when upon the earth by completing the work that He was given to do. The work set before Jesus -- including the cross He would soon voluntary pick up to pay for the sins of us all -- was the hardest work any human ever has or ever will face, and to an incalculable degree. But Jesus knew that the completion of His course brought glory to God.

And we must also remember that Jesus did not have to do any of this. He *chose* to, made the sacrifice willingly. The next verse, John 17:5, alludes to what Jesus gave up when He emptied Himself during the incarnation, a doctrine known as *kenosis*. While Jesus was indeed still fully God even as He came to take on humanity as well (forever binding Himself to us -- fully God yet fully man), He did not at all use the advantages or privileges of His divinity to skate through life. And that makes His example all the more powerful.

So what we are to learn from Jesus and His dedication towards the glory of God? Scripture puts it better than I ever could:

{{% scripture-h p="Philippians 2:5-11 | NIV84"%}}
**5** Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:  
**6** Who, being in very nature God,  
did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,  
**7** but made himself nothing,  
taking the very nature of a servant,  
being made in human likeness.  
**8** And being found in appearance as a man,  
he humbled himself  
and became obedient to death—  
even death on a cross!  
**9** Therefore God exalted him to the highest place  
and gave him the name that is above every name,  
**10** that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,  
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,  
**11** and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,  
to the glory of God the Father.

{{% scripture-l p="Philippians 2:5-11 | NIrV"%}}
**5** You should think in the same way Christ Jesus does.  
**6** In his very nature he was God.  
But he did not think that being equal with God was something he should hold on to.  
**7** Instead, he made himself nothing.  
He took on the very nature of a servant.  
He was made in human form.  
**8** He appeared as a man.  
He came down to the lowest level.  
He obeyed God completely, even though it led to his death.  
In fact, he died on a cross.  
**9** So God lifted him up to the highest place.  
He gave him the name that is above every name.  
**10** When the name of Jesus is spoken, everyone’s knee will bow to worship him.  
Every knee in heaven and on earth and under the earth will bow to worship him.  
**11** Everyone’s mouth will say that Jesus Christ is Lord.  
And God the Father will receive the glory.

Jesus gave up everything for the glory of the Father. Are we willing to do the same to honor God in our own lives? We ought to be -- this consideration of honoring God ought to weigh heavily in all the decisions we make, including which voices to listen to. For our purpose here in this world is not comfort or blessing or even family, but to glorify God and fulfill the mission He has given us.

This week's lesson starts on page 95 of the workbook, and was what we went through on 02/19/2023.
