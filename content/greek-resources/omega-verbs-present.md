## A note on content ordering: starting vocab ASAP

We have thus far covered the alphabet and Greek's somewhat complex accentuation system. In terms of core language features, we still have the messy phenomenon of Greek vowel contraction, but I have chosen to put that off for several lessons for one reason: vocab.

While it is true that people are different, and have strengths and weaknesses in different areas, my observation is that vocab is always what ultimately shoots holes in people's success. There's only so much grammar, and while Greek's is quite complex (so there's a great deal more grammar to be learned than most all other languages), the overall volume of things to be learned is still much smaller on the grammar side than the vocab side.

The upshot of this is that we want to start spaced repetition on the vocab ASAP. It's worth putting off the grammar for a bit to start getting to that magical 70% or 80% vocab level (i.e., when you know 70% or 80% of the words in a text) so that you can achieve general reading fluency.

Thus, this lesson covers the present system for so-called ω-verbs, and the next lessons cover second declension masculine and neuter nouns and adjectives. (First declension feminine nouns have 4 types so end up needing much more overall explanation).

Armed with this knowledge, you should make use of the filtering on DCC's excellent core vocabulary list, and start learning ω-verbs and second declension nouns. Eventually it is best to learn vocab by picking it up in context, but you have to have a base to start with, so I recommend brute-forcing (learning by rote vocabulary memorization via flashcards and the like) to around 70% -- learning words in order of descending frequency of occurrence until you can identify 70% or so of most texts without any lexicon.

### Do you need to memorize all six principal parts for verbs?

Greek has up to six forms (called "principal parts") you have to memorize for each verb to be able to recognize/construct all forms. However, the first three principal parts -- the present, future, and aorist -- are the ones that are used more often by far (at least for most verbs -- there are exceptions, of course), and this is true in the New Testament to a greater degree than in many other writings.

I am an engineer at heart. We have excellent Bible software programs that will immediately parse the nasty forms on hover, so what I advocate for as a matter of practical expediency is doing that which allows you to reach the highest level of Greek reading fluency in the least time. In practice, this means you need to be able to recognize the most statistically common forms. If you can get "most of them," a lot of the time you can piece together the rest of a sentence by context (you will often recognize underlying verbs, even if you're not quite sure what their exact forms are, and can therefore infer the general meaning). Things you you can't figure out, you can let the morphological parsers handle.

There are some teachers in the body of Christ who need to do better than this. In computer science, we talk about ["grokking"](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/grok) things -- grasping them on a fundamental level with intuition such that you "become one" with the knowledge (in a manner of speaking). Some teachers need to truly grok Greek. Most of us teachers learning Greek (and Hebrew for that matter -- the original languages in general) can reap most of the benefits from a solid working knowledge, a good reading fluency, and then rely on the handful of teachers who live and breathe the languages for the few questions that we won't really be qualified to weigh in on. This division of labor among Bible teachers yields the maximum language-derived benefit in the least time, but it does require that there is at least one trustworthy teacher with the greater background in the languages that you can rely on. In my opinion, anyone willing to accept the authority of [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) has this.

So to roll back to the actual question at hand, my answer is that it depends on what "kind" of person you view yourself as. Are you someone learning the languages as a practical boon to your teaching, or someone who is going to be dedicating yourself to the languages to a noticeably higher degree than other teachers? If you are the former, my opinion is that you should feel no shame just memorizing the first 3 principal parts of verbs, and shoot for a good reading fluency. If you are the latter, you should learn all the forms and shoot for better than just "good enough" expertise in Greek.

## The Greek present system

Since this is the first time we are addressing verbs formally, we'll go through a bit of extra analogy here. We won't be this verbose in the future.

Consider the English word "carry":

|                | Singular          | Plural      |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| **1st Person** | I carry           | we carry    |
| **2nd Person** | you carry         | y'all carry |
| **3rd Person** | he/she/it carries | they carry  |

As you can see, English does not typically change forms based on person and number (i.e., whether the verb corresponds to a singular subject or plural subjects). If you've ever had exposure to an inflected language (such as Spanish, for example), you are probably already aware that many other languages *do* change verb forms based on person or number. Greek is such a language.

It should be clear that the "root form" for this word in English is "carry." Imagine for a moment that you were to write the pronouns as endings on the root rather than before it as separate words:

|                | Singular        | Plural      |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **1st Person** | carry-I         | carry-we    |
| **2nd Person** | carry-you       | carry-y'all |
| **3rd Person** | carry-he (e.g.) | carry-they  |

Now, imagine that we decided that writing out the full pronouns all the time was too much work, so we decided to shorten the endings (well, mostly):

|                | Singular  | Plural        |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **1st Person** | carry-o   | carry-omen    |
| **2nd Person** | carry-eis | carry-ete     |
| **3rd Person** | carry-ei  | carry-ousi(n) |

Now, write those shortened endings in Greek:

|                | Singular | Plural   |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| **1st Person** | -ω       | -ομεν    |
| **2nd Person** | -εις     | -ετε     |
| **3rd Person** | -ει      | -ουσι(ν) |

And there you have it. Basic personal endings in Greek. Stick these on a present root, and you've got the Greek present system.

The Greek word for "carry" has the following first three principal parts: πορεύω, πορεύσω, ἐπόρευσα.

It so happens that the first principal part of Greek verbs will always be the 1st person singular form in the present system. To get the root, you take off the ω. For our verb, that would give us πορεύ- as the root. Thus, we have:

|                | Singular                    | Plural                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **1st Person** | πορεύω - I carry            | πορεύομεν - we carry      |
| **2nd Person** | πορεύεις - you carry        | πορεύετε - y'all carry    |
| **3rd Person** | πορεύει - he/she/it carries | πορεύουσι(ν) - they carry |

### Movable Nu

Observant readers will note that these tables had a Nu in parentheses in the 3rd person plural form. What's up with that?

When you have a verb ending in -σι (a 3rd person plural verb) positioned before a word beginning with a vowel, digraph, or diphthong, ancient Greek adds a final -ν. The final -ν is also often added if the -σι is showing up at the end of a clause (meaning a half-stop or full-stop comes after it).

This sort of thing should be familiar to English speakers: the indefinite article *a* becomes *an* before a word that begins with a vowel sound. 

These rules for the optional final -ν (known as a "movable Nu") hold for all other occurrences of it in the language. As you can see below, movable Nu also shows up in other words and forms.

## The  verb "to be"

The verb for "to be" is highly irregular in Greek, just like it is in most all languages.

It's not an ω-verb but I've included the paradigm for the present system here since you really need to know this one well. Practicing the forms early and often are the key, so here we are taking a stab at that early part.

|                | Singular               | Plural             |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| **1st Person** | εἰμί - I am            | ἐσμέν - we are     |
| **2nd Person** | εἶ - you are           | ἐστέ - ya'll are   |
| **3rd Person** | ἐστί(ν) - he/she/it is | εἰσί(ν) - they are |
