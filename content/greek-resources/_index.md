This section contains pages pertaining to the study of Ancient Greek, particularly the Greek of the New Testament and its time.

Some pages may link to videos from a Greek study group that I run (if discussion in the video is relevant to the page), and some of these videos, in turn, may link to pages on the site. In general, I would recommend focusing on the written content on the pages, as it will always be kept up to date, whereas the videos will not ever receive changes or corrections over time. (For a more thorough discussion, see [/site/recordings-of-online-bible-studies/#caveats-with-these-recordings-of-the-online-bible-studies](/site/recordings-of-online-bible-studies/#caveats-with-these-recordings-of-the-online-bible-studies)). I am simply offering the video recordings because it costs me very little effort to do so, and some people may find them helpful, even if they are not always perfect.

If you are interested in participating in the Greek study, [see here](/site/online-bible-studies/).
