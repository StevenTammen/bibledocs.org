   A video series going through SR4 on Ichthys, a study covering the structure and organization of Satan's world system. Satan is the present ruler of this world (only because God lets him, for this short time), and tries by all means to deceive us and distract us from the truth. By formally studying his strategies and tactics, we can learn to see through his illusions, and come to appreciate the spiritual realities that are actually at work in the world.

There is [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vKx7rnNMglihjHCiAniayAuvZ5ScZ3zLJ4p3HM_dTNE/edit?usp=sharing) for posting questions you have about things covered in the video lessons. If you post the questions for a given lesson early enough in the week (before Friday morning, say), I'll probably be able to come prepared to answer them when we record the Q&A video for that lesson.

Summary:

This week I introduced the new video study we will be having on SR4 - Satan's World System, a study on https://www.ichthys.com discussing the driving spiritual realities that lay veiled behind this world's physical veneer. In coming weeks we will start making points directly from the study, but this week was more of a conceptual introduction.

Summary:

Talking in-depth about Satan's world system has enough practical benefit that it is worth spending time on as an area of study. Satan's web of lies and deceit is far from unsuccessful in leading us humans away from the truth -- quite to the contrary, the system is devastatingly effective at preying upon our fallen natures to turn us against the Lord. It may seem harsh to speak in terms of most humans being deceived, but the truth is the truth. God didn't give Satan this control as some sort of gift, but Satan usurped it. God allows Satan this temporary control over the material world only because He uses the situation to test us and refine our faith; God's plan is perfect and unswerving, and the situation in no way caught Him by surprise. God could crush Satan instantly with the smallest movement of His finger, so we have nothing to worry about-- we have the Omnipotent Creator of the universe on our side. All we have to do is have faith.
