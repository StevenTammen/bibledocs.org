This series is the first recorded series of our Bible study group. We decided to go through [BB6A: Peripateology](https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm), a longform text study that is part of Ichthys' [Bible Basics Series](https://ichthys.com/Bible-Basics-Home-Page.htm), which is a complete systematic theology.

This study specifically deals with the concept of the Christian Walk -- the day-to-day fight we find ourselves in as believers in a hostile world. Much of the information in this study shows up in multiple other places on Ichthys, but this study is a good summary and encapsulation of some of the core principles necessary for growing up spiritually and fighting the good fight thereafter.

## Focus and pace

While the general format may change if and when we tackle a book of scripture directly, for this study, we have kept discussion only loosely organized around the written Ichthys materials. In practice, this means that our discussion ranges rather widely on a range of topics rather than staying laser-focused on our source reading material. This also means that our pace has been rather relaxed in terms of what we get through each week.

## Notable speakers on the recordings

The people you will hear most by far on these recordings are myself (Steven Tammen) and [Odii Ariwodo](/links/#writings-from-the-desk-of-odii-ariwodo), another of the [next-generation Bible teachers](/links/#next-generation-options) who came up under [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) and [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists).
