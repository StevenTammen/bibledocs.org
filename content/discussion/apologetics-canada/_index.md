I think that accurately sums things up. [Wes Huff](https://www.youtube.com/@WesHuff) is on staff at Apologetics Canada, so if you haven't heard of them as an organization, you may have heard of him as an individual, since he went pretty viral in certain circles over the last couple years.

Apologetics Canada has several different main series at time of writing:

- [Can I Trust the Bible? – Exploring the good reason to trust in the most impactful book in history](https://bible.apologeticscanada.com/)
- [BRANDED - Apologetics Canada](https://apologeticscanada.com/branded/)
- [Thinking Series](https://think.apologeticscanada.com/)
- [The Human Project](https://human.apologeticscanada.com/)

As one might expect given the name, their focus is primarily on apologetics proper.
