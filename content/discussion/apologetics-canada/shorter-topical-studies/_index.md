title: "Shorter topical studies (src: Apologetics Canada)"
layout: list-page
summary:
    This section contains discussion series based on shorter topical studies from Apologetics Canada.

    As a reminder, Shorter Topical Studies go over things topically (tracing a subject rather than sticking with a specific part of scripture), and tend to trace topics much narrower in overall scope than those covered in the Longer Topical Studies, which is why they end up shorter.
