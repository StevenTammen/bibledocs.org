summary:
    This discussion series is about the "How can I trust the Bible?" study from Apologetics Canada. The original study goes over reasons we have can have full confidence in the Bible as our source of truth, such as how it contains only genuine books (and not fakes), and how the text that has come down to us from antiquity is astoundingly free from problems, all things considered.
