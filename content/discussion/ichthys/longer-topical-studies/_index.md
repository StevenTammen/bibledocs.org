layout: list-page
summary:
    This section contains discussion series based on longer topical studies from Ichthys.

    As a reminder, Longer Topical Studies go over things topically (tracing a subject rather than sticking with a specific part of scripture), and tend to trace topics much wider in overall scope than those covered in the Shorter Topical Studies, which is why they end up longer.
