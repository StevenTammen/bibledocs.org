summary:
    This discussion series is about part 5 of the Satanic Rebellion series from Ichthys. The original study is about God's complete plan for human history, split into seven millennial "days" that parallel the seven days of re-creation discussed in the early chapters of Genesis. Human history is playing out amidst wider phases of judgment, restoration, and replacement, as God's plan to redeem all creation proceeds to its inexorable conclusion, culminating in the creation of the New Heavens and New Earth.

These six periods divide history from a secular point of view, listing in order the significant divisions of human history chronologically rather than categorizing them on the basis of any spiritual significance (which is the basis for the five categorizations that precede and the one which follows). If, as many exegetes throughout the history of the Church have claimed, "six" is the number of Man, six periods of history from the human as opposed to the divine perspective are all the more understandable. For one thing, six periods are certainly one short of the one number which most clearly has symbolic significance in the Bible: i.e., "seven" (see II.7 immediately below). However that may be, for our purposes it is enough to note that history, divided into the six periods listed below, is significant not for any divine trend or characteristic, but for the different emphases of satanic attack manifest in each one. These six periods, therefore, present history largely from the devil's point of view. Specifically, they highlight the major objects of his attacks on mankind from the fall to the end of history:

<!-- --- -->

a) <u>The Antediluvian Period</u>: From the fall to the flood. Primary satanic target: true humanity.

b) <u>The Postdiluvian Gentile Period</u>: From the flood to Abraham. Primary satanic target: freedom and law.

c) <u>The Jewish Period</u>: From Abraham to Christ. Primary satanic target: the people and the nation of Israel.

d) <u>The Church Period</u>: From Christ to the beginning of the Tribulation. Primary satanic target: the truth of the Word of God.

e) <u>The Tribulational Period</u>: The seven years preceding the return of Christ. Primary satanic target: all of the above (humanity, freedom and law, Israel, truth) along with a particular emphasis on eradicating believers from the earth, as the devil employs any and all means available to him in the short time he has remaining.

f) <u>The Millennial Period</u>: The thousand years following the return of Christ. Primary satanic target: the rule of Christ (attacked after Satan is released at the end of the period).

<!-- --- -->

Satan's counter-strategy (against God's plan), therefore, forms the basis for the six periods listed above. This strategy (and its implementation within human history) is the subject of [section III](https://ichthys.com/Satans-Rebellion-Part5.htm#Counter-Strategy) below and will therefore be reserved for detailed discussion. It should be noted here, however, that from the human point of view, history is a dark, unpleasant progression, characterized only by the successive attacks of the devil upon all that is righteous and truly worthwhile. Only through God's divine control of history are we delivered from the adversary and blessed in this his evil world.

#### Summary points {#the-six-chronological-periods-of-human-history-src-ichthys-summary-points}

Unlike the divisions of history we have previously examined (one through five) and the one that will follow (seven)---all of which divide history by various spiritually-significant criteria---the sixfold division of history we are putting forward here is actually mostly focused on looking at history absent the divine point of view. That is why the divisions outlined here are dealing with targets of Satan's attack on God's plan: since we are here looking at things *not* from God's point of view, it makes sense to examine that angle. (At least in part as a foil to God's purposes).

<!-- --- -->

In table form, the six chronological periods of human history:

| **Name**                 | **Time bounds**                                   | **Primary satanic target**                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Antediluvian Period  | From the fall to the flood                        | True humanity                                                                                                                        |
| The Postdiluvian Period  | From the flood to Abraham                         | Freedom and law                                                                                                                      |
| The Jewish Period        | From Abraham to Christ                            | The people and the nation of Israel                                                                                                  |
| The Church Period        | From Christ to the beginning of the Tribulation   | The truth of the Word of God                                                                                                         |
| The Tribulational Period | The seven years preceding the return of Christ    | All of the above (humanity, freedom and law, Israel, truth) along with a particular emphasis on eradicating believers from the earth |
| The Millennial Period    | The thousand years following the return of Christ | The rule of Christ (attacked after Satan is released at the end of the period)                                                       |

From the human point of view, history is a dark, unpleasant progression, characterized only by the successive attacks of the devil upon all that is righteous and truly worthwhile. Only through God's divine control of history are we delivered from the adversary and blessed in this his evil world.

#### Follow-on topics {#the-six-chronological-periods-of-human-history-src-ichthys-follow-on-topics}

We will discuss the specifics of Satan's counter-strategy in a great deal more depth later in this study, but I want us to think upfront for a moment about how Satan's plans are different from God's plans in one very important way: they are necessarily reactive in nature.

On the surface, it can seem like God changed His mind as human history played out. For example, for some period of time humans lived without the Mosaic Law, for some period of time people in Israel operated under the Law, and then Jesus came and we were freed from the shackles of the Law. Is that not God "changing His mind" as events played out?

Properly understood, it really isn't. God's entire plan was set in stone from the beginning; it was always intended to play out exactly how it did, down to the smallest detail. So God is not "reacting" in any actions He takes, in the sense that He changes His plans based on feedback from observing material creation. Instead, all of His plans were foreordained from eternity past.

<!-- --- -->

But as we will see, the same cannot be said for Satan's plans. How can we know this? Because the pattern of events we see recorded in history clearly shows Satan switching approaches over and over again as his plans repeatedly come to naught. For example, Satan first tries to pollute true humanity's bloodline through angelic interbreeding with human women, as discussed in Genesis 6. When God subsequently kills all the Nephilim while delivering Noah and His family from the flood (and imprisoned the angels responsible: cf. 2 Peter 2:4-10a; Jude 1:6), Satan's tactics change. In the post-flood world, he switches to trying to build a one world state to make top-down repression of human freedom possible. But then God foiled that too in the Tower of Babel. Rinse, repeat.

In this, we can see that Satan is constrained by limitations not unlike our own: as a mere created creature, he cannot accurately predict the future, and can only change his plans based upon feedback he gets as events play out. He can only dance in the palm of God's hand, insofar as God allows Him to in order to test human hearts. The supposed "contest" between Good and Evil is in truth nothing of the sort; there is no contest, because Satan cannot compare to God in the least. 

<!-- --- -->

Another thing to discuss is how grim human history is if you take away the divine, spiritual dimension. In essence, if you remove the spiritual point of view, human history is nothing more than escalating Satanic attacks upon humanity.

Humanity as a species (if you want to think of us in this way) is facing a foe far more powerful and intelligent than we. In truth, were it not for God's restraint, Satan would have long succeeded in wiping humanity from the face of the Earth. The only reason why he hasn't succeeded is because God is seriously limiting what attacks he is allowed to make upon humanity.

You can imagine how frustrating this must be for Satan. At every turn he is blocked from doing what he truly wants, and every time he is actually allowed to do something, it inevitably only ever plays right into God's hands. This would be frustrating enough if it happened even once, but consider that this has happened over and over for thousands of years.

<!-- --- -->

And so it is that when Satan is cast out from heaven (as Revelation 12 describes), he will pour out his stored-up wrath upon the Earth. His rage will be terrible---like that of a cornered beast---not only because everything he has worked for from the beginning will have utterly failed, but also because he will know at this point that final judgment will soon come upon him, that the clock will be indefatigably ticking a countdown to his certain doom.

And the truly terrifying thing is that God will remove the largest part of His restrictions on Satan during this period. So not only will Satan be seething with fury like never before, but he will also for the first time in human history be allowed to actually vent that fury in a manner even close to approaching what he truly desires.

Thus it is that Satan's attacks upon humanity during the Tribulation will put all of Satan's previous efforts completely in the shade, to a degree we can scarcely imagine. Understanding that, we'd better square our shoulders and throw ourselves into serious spiritual growth as much as possible... so that we will be able to face these things with faith and hope rather than utter despair. If we don't, we may well find ourselves crumbling under the pressure that will be more intense than in any other time in human history.

{{% quote src="https://ichthys.com/Satans-Rebellion-Part5.htm" text="Ichthys" %}}

When God restored the heavens and the earth to habitable form, He did so in six literal days, leaving the seventh as a day of rest to memorialize the principle of peace and rest available to all who trust in Him. These seven days of the earth's re-creation began the process of God's judgment upon evil, His restoration of the universe, and His replacement of Satan. As we saw in [section I](https://ichthys.com/Satans-Rebellion-Part5.htm#I.%20Judgment,%20Restoration%20and%20Replacement%20I:%20Positional%20Victory%20%28Progeny%20and%20Promise%29) above, following His divine judgment upon the heavens and the earth in response to Satan's rebellion, God restored the earth and set the stage for the replacement of Satan and his followers with Adam and his progeny. Though the devil thought to disrupt this prospect through his temptation of Adam and Eve, the fall of mankind merely set in motion the grand Plan of God for human history, a design which pivots around the incarnation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and which will culminate in the ultimate replacement of the devil and his followers at history's end.

<!-- --- -->

Besides marking the first phase of judgment, restoration and replacement, these first seven literal days were also symbolic of the entire course of human history that was to come. For the seven days of re-creation correspond to the seven millennia of human history, a definite period of time ordained by God before the foundation of the world within which mankind would be saved by the gift of Christ and within which all things would be judged, restored and replaced. As we have seen above, different conditions prevail in different periods, both from the standpoint of God's provision of grace and from the point of view of Satan's method of attack. Just as the restoration of what was destroyed in heaven and on earth in the wake of God's original judgment upon the devil and his followers was replaced in phases during seven literal days, so throughout the course of the seven millennia of human history God is phasing in replacements for Satan and the fallen angels, demonstrating in the process His multifarious grace to believers regardless of the vastly different circumstances under which they are called out:

<!-- --- -->

**Days 1 and 2: The Gentiles:** (ca. 4065-2065 B.C.)

a. <u>The Antediluvian Civilization</u>:

*Time Frame*: From Adam's fall to circa Noah.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God while transitioning from perfect environment to the hardships of the present world.

b. <u>The Division of the Nations</u>:

*Time Frame*: From circa Noah to Abraham.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God in the face of unprecedented satanic attacks (i.e., the genetic dilution of Genesis chapter six, and Satan's post-flood attempt to establish one-world government).

<!-- --- -->

**Days 3 and 4: Israel:** (ca. 2065-2 B.C.) [the 70 years of the Babylonian captivity excepted; the seven years of the Tribulation still future]

c. <u>The Nation of Israel</u>:

*Time Frame*: From Abraham to circa David.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God as His unique witnesses (and as primary targets of the devil) in the midst of a pagan world.

d. <u>The Kingdom of Israel</u>:

*Time Frame*: From circa David to Christ.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God as members (or associates) of His unique nation Israel (the central point of satanic opposition) in the midst of a world of devil-worshipping nations.

<!-- --- -->

**Days 5 and 6: The Church:** (ca. 33-2033 A.D.)

e. <u>Centralized Christianity</u>:

*Time Frame*: From Christ to circa the schism of the Church.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God despite growing opposition to the truth from monolithic, bureaucratic pseudo-Christianity.

f. <u>Decentralized Christianity</u>:

*Time Frame*: From circa the schism of the Church to the Second Advent of Christ.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God in the face of mounting attacks on the truth from all quarters (religious, social, economic and political), culminating in the most intense period of pressure and opposition in human history, the Tribulation.

<!-- --- -->

**Day 7: The Kingdom of God (the Sabbath Day):** (ca. 2033-3033 A.D.)

g. <u>The Millennium</u>:

*Time Frame*: From the Second Advent of Christ to the Gog-Magog Rebellion.

*Challenge to believers*: To maintain and develop faith in God while transitioning from the devil's world to Christ's perfect rule over mankind (sinful human beings facing the ultimate prosperity test).

#### Summary points {#the-seven-days-of-human-history-src-ichthys-summary-points}

As we covered previously in this study, the seven days of the earth's re-creation began the process of God's judgment upon evil, His restoration of the universe, and His replacement of Satan:

- Following His divine judgment upon the heavens and the earth in *response* to Satan's rebellion...
- God *restored* the earth and set the stage for...
- The *replacement* of Satan and his followers with Adam and his progeny.

Satan's attacks on God's plan (such as tempting Adam and Eve) cannot shake God's plan to replace Satan and his followers. The fall of mankind just set in motion God's Perfect Plan to redeem humanity through the incarnation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

<!-- --- -->

Besides marking the first phase of judgment, restoration and replacement, these first seven literal days were also symbolic of the entire course of human history that was to come:

| **During**                                 | **God replaced/is replacing**                                                                                     | **With**                     |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| The seven days of re-creation              | What was destroyed in heaven and on earth in the wake of God's original judgment upon the devil and his followers | A restored heavens and earth |
| The seven millennial days of human history | Satan and the fallen angels                                                                                       | Believers                    |

And so it is that the different days of re-creation map onto periods of human history:

<!-- --- -->

| **Wider division**                   | **Day** | **Description**               | **Time frame**                                                     | **Challenge to believers**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Note that in the chronology, with respect to Israel, the 70 years of the Babylonian captivity are excepted in the year count, and the seven years of the Tribulation are still future in the year count.

#### Follow-on topics {#the-seven-days-of-human-history-src-ichthys-follow-on-topics}

I've mentioned before that as I see things, whatever you think of the first six divisions of human history we've gone through, the seven millennial days of human history are sort of the most important division from the perspective of informing our theology. For it is through the seven millennial days of human history that we come to see human history as being constrained to a fixed 7,000 year timetable.

This poses no issue since this is the one division of the seven that is most obvious from scripture, as far as I see things. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if you don't teach some version of the seven millennial days, you are missing some clear hints in the Bible. We'll get into the specifics of the evidence more in the videos immediately following this one, but in my eyes, the one initial thing that always most clearly stands out is the Millennium (the last 1,000 years of human history) being parallel to God's seventh day of rest. If you can buy the clear correspondence there, then the rest of the days become not a matter of "if", but a matter of "how".

<!-- --- -->

Critics might label what I just termed "the rest" as nothing but confirmation bias = cherry-picking evidence to support a predetermined conclusion. As I see it though, it is a methodical process of taking into account the wealth of chronological information the Bible has, and showing how it precisely fits into the predicted structure.

Don't get me wrong, there is still some faith involved here, and there always will be. But in my opinion, there are far, far too many coincidences for there not to be anything here. And so I would encourage anyone harboring skepticism to try to keep an open mind as we discuss the concept of the seven millennial days. As we shall see, the evidence is all there, if you are willing to look for it. But it doesn't work if you *assume* upfront that God having a definite chronological plan for human history is black and white impossible.

<!-- --- -->

For whatever reason, many people seem to have "issues" with that as a possible position. My best guess is because there have been many, many false teachers throughout history who have tied themselves to dates that ultimately proved to be false. And fair enough. But as we'll go over, no matter what you ultimately think of it, the teaching of the seven millennial days is definitely more biblical interpretation than fanciful conspiracy theory. Can biblical interpretations ultimately be wrong? Sure they can. But the point is that they are most certainly *not* in the same category as the "out there" teachings that people often think of when it comes to predictions about the end of the world.
