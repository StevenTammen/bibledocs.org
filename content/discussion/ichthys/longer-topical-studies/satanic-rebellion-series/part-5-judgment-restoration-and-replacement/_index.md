summary:
    This discussion series is about part 5 of the Satanic Rebellion series from Ichthys. The original study is about God's complete plan for human history, split into seven millennial "days" that parallel the seven days of re-creation discussed in the early chapters of Genesis. Human history is playing out amidst wider phases of judgment, restoration, and replacement, as God's plan to redeem all creation proceeds to its inexorable conclusion, culminating in the creation of the New Heavens and New Earth.
