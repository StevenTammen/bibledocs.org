## Summary {#summary}

The cherubim (the fourfold angelic guardians of God's chariot-throne), have taken over some of the responsibilities Satan used to have in his duties before his rebellion, but more importantly, also serve to point to Satan's true replacement: Jesus Christ, the God-Man. Each of the four faces that these angels possess represents a "mission" that Jesus has undertaken/will undertake as humanity's liberator and champion.

Before the rebellion of the devil and his angels, Satan occupied a unique position in God's creation (see [Part 3 of this series, section III](https://ichthys.com/Fall-sr3.htm#III.%20Status%20Quo%20in%20Paradise)). He was the guardian cherub, assigned to protect the holiness of God from everything profane, and he appeared before God bedecked with memorial jewels betokening the original nine angelic divisions. Created to serve and glorify God in these and other special ways, the devil decided instead to attempt to replace God as ruler of the universe. As a consequence, Satan has now been replaced in his duties as *the* cherub by four other (elect) angelic creatures.

These newly appointed cherubim, in addition to taking over the devil's former duties, also have the important function of symbolizing the life and work of the One who is, as the new Morning Star, the ultimate and transcendent replacement for Lucifer, the Redeemer of those whom the devil seeks to destroy. In this capacity, each cherub represents the four major aspects of Christ's role as the Savior-King of human history, and each of these four aspects likewise corresponds to a distinct age of that history in which that aspect is visibly revealed:

- <u>Gentile Age</u>: Christ promised to all humanity in general as Savior.
- <u>Jewish Age</u>: Christ promised to Israel in particular as Messiah.
- <u>Church Age</u>: Christ having been revealed in Person in the (virgin-born) flesh in humility as the suffering Servant.
- <u>Millennial Age</u>: Christ having been revealed in Person in the (resurrected) flesh in glory as the King.

<!-- --- -->

As we saw in the first installment of this series, Satan, in his role as Lucifer (the Morning Star), was meant to be a unique reflection of the glory of God. In this role, he was the creature counterpart of the divine Angel of the Lord, the pre-incarnate Jesus Christ (see [Part 4, section III.3.b](https://ichthys.com/SR4(SWS).htm#Angel_of_the_Lord)). After the devil's rebellion occasioned the events we call human history, however, the appointment of a college of four cherubim was symbolically necessary. For Jesus Christ would personally supplant the devil in a transcendent way, so that the function of the cherubim from the standpoint of reflecting the divine glory would now be directed towards the victor of human history, our Savior. So it is that the four cherubs who attend God's throne represent four important aspects of Christ's unique Person and work. Moreover in doing so (a point which is apropos of our immediate topic), the symbolism which each of the four faces of the cherubim espouses corresponds to a primary aspect of Christ's person and work as it is revealed within each of the four ages of human history:

- <u>Bullock-face</u>: (Gentiles): Christ promised to all humanity in general as Savior.
- <u>Lion-face</u>: (Israel): Christ promised to Israel in particular as Messiah.
- <u>Human-face</u>: (Church): Christ come in person in the flesh in humility as the Servant.
- <u>Eagle-face</u>: (Millennium): Christ come in person in the flesh in glory as the King.

### Summary points {#summary-points}

Satan used to be the pre-eminent created creature. After His rebellion he was replaced by four elect angelic creatures known as the cherubim.

In addition to taking over the devil's former duties, these newly appointed cherubim also have the important function of symbolizing the life and work of Jesus Christ.

In this capacity, they represent the four major aspects of Christ's role as the Savior-King of human history, corresponding to the four distinct age of history in which that aspect is visibly revealed:

- <u>Gentile Age</u>: Christ promised to all humanity in general as Savior.
- <u>Jewish Age</u>: Christ promised to Israel in particular as Messiah.
- <u>Church Age</u>: Christ having been revealed in Person in the (virgin-born) flesh in humility as the suffering Servant.
- <u>Millennial Age</u>: Christ having been revealed in Person in the (resurrected) flesh in glory as the King.

<!-- --- -->

While the cherubim have replaced parts of Satan's initial role in creation, Jesus Christ as *the* Morning Star will be Satan's ultimate replacement, a resurrected human being taking over the position of pre-eminent creature (mirroring the divine Angel of the Lord as a reflection of God's glory).

In line with that underlying replacement, the function of the cherubim from the standpoint of reflecting divine glory is directed towards Jesus Christ. The symbolism which each of the four faces of the cherubim espouses corresponds to a primary aspect of Christ's person and work as it is revealed within each of the four ages of human history:

- <u>Bullock-face</u>: (Gentiles): Christ promised to all humanity in general as Savior.
- <u>Lion-face</u>: (Israel): Christ promised to Israel in particular as Messiah.
- <u>Human-face</u>: (Church): Christ come in person in the flesh in humility as the Servant.
- <u>Eagle-face</u>: (Millennium): Christ come in person in the flesh in glory as the King.

### Follow-on topics {#follow-on-topics}

Sometimes I think we get so used to thinking about Satan as an architect of evil that we forget that he used to be in the highest position of authority in the entire created universe. In many ways, this makes his rebellion all the greater a betrayal. If God is analogous to a human king (well, really it is the other way around in terms of true symbolism, but you get the idea), then Satan's rebellion was akin to a *coup d'état* led by the king's closest subordinate. That sort of knife in the back is in many respects the most heartbreaking kind.

It also demonstrates the principle of "power corrupts". From any reasonable way at looking at things, Satan had it all. Yet he chose to throw it all away in arrogant rebellion, raising his hand against his Maker.

Understanding Satan's previous role also helps us better appreciate Christ's identity as *the* Morning Star. After His session in the court of the Father (so to speak), the God-Man Jesus Christ sits at the Father's right hand, and all judgement and authority has been given over to Him. As the perfect Son of Man, He reflects God's glory as the firstborn Prince of the Universe.

Last lesson we were focused on the different periods of sojourning through the wilderness of Satan's *kosmos* believers have faced throughout human history. Now we are examining human history through the lens of Christ's relationship to humanity as our Savior-King. The animal skins given to Adam and Eve immediately after the Fall (Genesis 3:21) already pointed to the promise of a Savior for humanity. Then more promises were given to the patriarchs, speaking of a Messiah for the bloodline of Abraham/Isaac/Jacob specifically. Then Jesus Christ came in the flesh to make good on God's covenant promises, like we discussed when we talked about the two phases of human history. And finally, Christ will return in glory with the crown and establish His perfect kingdom upon the Earth.

We have repeatedly emphasized how all history is ultimately about Jesus Christ, and you can see that clearly here in these four ages. From beginning to end, it has always been all about Him.
