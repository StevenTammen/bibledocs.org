title: Discussion
layout: list-page
summary:
    The discussion content on this site is organized around the original content of another. Basically, in group Bible studies, I summarize some audio or video content from a different ministry (section by section), and then we discuss each bit in turn as a wider group. Organizing our discussion around pre-existing content really helps jumpstart discussion, and also helps keep our group Bible studies from ending up as me sitting up there and droning on... in such a way that it puts everyone to sleep.
