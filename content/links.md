## Links to other teaching ministries/teachers

Just like this ministry, all of the ministries listed below are not affiliated with any particular denomination or group. However, they too generally fall into the "conservative evangelical tradition." To the objection that all parties in these ministries know and correspond with each other (making my recommendation of them not entirely free of bias), I would answer that all of us are independent from external authority and hold quite firmly to the belief that the Bible correctly understood and interpreted is the sole measure of truth in this life. Some of us can and do disagree with each other on various points, but all of the ministries I recommend below are substantively teaching the Word of God, completely free from the doctrinal shackles imposed by denominationalism and high church tradition, being instead guided only by what the Bible actually says. Most of us have made personal sacrifice and work to support ourselves (as with Paul's tent-making) so that we may teach that which we truly believe with clear consciences and offer all of our materials free of charge. (All the ministries below offer the entirety of their teaching materials without cost, as ministries of grace).

I have included email addresses for those ministries that take questions: in my own experience, I have found that there are occasions when asking questions directly to ask for clarification on a point of teaching or elaboration on something that is hard to understand is very, very useful. I highly recommend swallowing the initial discomfort and reaching out if you ever have questions. (You can see BibleDoc's policy on answering reader questions [here](/#fourth)).

### Thorough, well-established options

#### Ichthys

Link to ministry: [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/)

Contact the teacher: [questions2@ichthys.com](mailto:questions2@ichthys.com)

##### Steven's take

This is the ministry I recommend most highly. I grew up spiritually under Ichthys after I came across it back in 2014. Ichthys is a text-based ministry, and if you can handle the length and technical depth, it is absolutely fantastic. The teacher behind the site also answers reader questions in-depth over email.

At risk of stealing my own thunder, I do believe that Ichthys is a better choice for many people than my own ministry (if for no other reason than that the author has many, many more years of ministry experience than myself), and very much suggest that you give it a chance. 

On the other hand, this site, BibleDocs, does offer some things that Ichthys doesn't:

* It emphasizes conciseness more than Ichthys, and may therefore be generally better-suited than Ichthys for people who get bogged down in Ichthys' big studies.
* It offers basic, introductory teachings for new believers. These materials are targeting a level somewhat below even the simplest writings on Ichthys, with the goal of taking new believers from a point of almost complete ignorance of the Bible to the point where they can handle more advanced teaching like that found on Ichthys.
* For most content, this site also offers the option to toggle between higher level and lower level versions of the content. The higher level versions read similarly to Ichthys' technical, academic style, but the lower level versions contain writing that is simpler (in terms of technical complexity and prose difficulty) for folks that don't wish to wade through dense prose when getting their Bible teaching. People without substantial education, children, and/or non-native speakers of English may find these lower level versions of content to be useful.

##### Teacher

The teacher behind Ichthys is Dr. Robert Luginbill, [a Classics professor at the University of Louisville](https://louisville.edu/languages/about-us/faculty-profiles/robert-d-luginbill). You can see his CV [here](https://ichthys.com/cv3.htm). He has a Ph.D. in Classics (many of his academic writings have centered on the Greek historian Thucydides), and also an academic seminary degree from Talbot in Hebrew Old Testament.

Dr. Luginbill is extremely well-qualified in matters of Greek and Hebrew.

##### Materials offered

Ichthys offers an introduction to spiritual growth and essential doctrines in the [Peter Series](https://ichthys.com/Peter-Series-Home-Page.htm) (the shortest series on the site), an in-depth systematic theology in the [Bible Basics Series](https://ichthys.com/Bible-Basics-Home-Page.htm), and a very thorough treatment of eschatology (study of the end times; compare the book of Revelation) in the [Coming Tribulation Series](https://ichthys.com/Coming-Tribulation-Home-Page.htm), with the [Satanic Rebellion Series](https://ichthys.com/Satanic-Rebellion-Home-Page.htm) being a logical predecessor that covers, among other things, the wider context of human existence in God's plan for creation. Ichthys also has [posted email responses](https://ichthys.com/e-mails.htm#More_E-mails) on a huge variety of topics. On the more procedural side, Ichthys has a very useful [Subject Index](https://ichthys.com/subject-index.htm) (containing links to where Dr. Luginbill covers specific subjects) and a [Translation Index](https://ichthys.com/translist.htm) (containing links to original translations on Ichthys).

It is notable that Ichthys does not focus so much on verse-by-verse studies. The Peter Series does go through the text of Peter's epistles (albeit slowly), and the Coming Tribulation Series does completely go through Revelation (along with other passages from Daniel and so on), but the site is really organized more topically.

#### Bible Academy

Link to ministry: [Bible Academy YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists)

Contact the teacher: <https://bibleacademyonline.com/omo/contact/>

##### Steven's take

This is the ministry I recommend second most highly. It is primarily a YouTube ministry (in the same sort of style as Khan Academy), although [there is a website too](https://bibleacademyonline.com/omo/).

I'm more of a written-study guy myself (and do believe that text is generally better as a study medium for most people), but for times when you want to do video or audio study, Bible Academy is a great option. Like Ichthys, the volume of material offered is pretty staggering.

I find that I typically listen to Bible Academy studies at 1.75x or 2x speed, and feel like I don't miss much even at these speeds. Listening at a faster rate saves a lot of time in the long run.

##### Teacher

The teacher behind Bible Academy is Curtis Omo. Pastor Omo holds a B.A. in Classics, an M.Div. in New Testament Literature and an S.T.M. in Semitics and Old Testament studies with concentrations in Greek and Hebrew.

Pastor Omo is well-qualified in matters of Greek and Hebrew.

##### Materials offered

Bible Academy offers a few topical series (e.g., [Basic Bible](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMu_1csD4LY-o2Zjj37h9Z8yW4nFQObWr)), but most of its offerings are verse-by-verse. This is fortunate, as it means that Bible Academy ends up complementing Ichthys (which is primarily topical rather than verse-by-verse) quite well.

Of particular note is that Bible Academy offers "Children's Series" alongside many of its adult series. While you might think that these would be at too low a level for adults, they are actually a perfectly reasonable starting place, and somewhat ironically, contain more substantive Bible teaching than most adult teaching from conventional sources in our lukewarm era. This split in content levels is where I drew the inspiration to do the same as much as practically possible on BibleDocs (although some sections don't lend themselves as well to simplification). Since Ichthys doesn't have much in the way of starting materials (even the [Peter Series](https://ichthys.com/Peter-Series-Home-Page.htm) is not particularly low-level), Bible Academy probably has more material useful for young children and/or very new believers. It is worth pointing out that children and new believers pick up much more than you might think, so I would err on the side of harder materials rather than easier materials, especially if they are expressing interest.

### "Next-generation" options

There is a group of younger teachers who, like myself, grew up spiritually under Ichthys and Bible Academy. I am actually on the younger end of this group. At any rate, some of us are now producing our own ministry materials and launching our own ministries.

Unsurprisingly, all of us are colored by the teachings of Ichthys and Bible Academy, although we all are of course our own teachers.

#### Bible Crash Course

Link to ministry: [Bible Crash Course YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChhe0vK1hz8bxzcphHWpFmg/featured)

Contact the teacher: [wfrieke@gmail.com](mailto:wfrieke@gmail.com)

##### Steven's take

Bible Crash Course is another YouTube teaching ministry, although it does have different focuses than Bible Academy. It tackles many of the same sorts of things as this ministry does (or will), but in a video format (with all the pros and cons that entails).

One important point to make is that Bible Crash Course tends to favor shorter video lengths relative to Bible Academy (much in the same way this site tries to stick to shorter writings than Ichthys). The video lengths are somewhat variable (so some are longer than others), but it is accurate to say that Bible Crash Course videos tend to be noticeably shorter than Bible Academy videos. This can help make content easier to get through, as attention can wander easily as videos track up into that hour range that is common for Bible Academy videos. (Although some of the degree to which this consideration matters depends upon the individual, as some people don't have much of a problem with longer videos).

As with Bible Academy, I find that I listen to Bible Crash Course videos at 1.75x or 2x speed, and feel like I don't miss much even at these speeds. Listening at a faster rate saves a lot of time in the long run.

##### Teacher

The teacher behind Bible Crash Course is Will Rieke. Will and I are among the youngest of our cadre, but this isn't necessarily a strike against us (compare 1 Timothy 4:12).

While Will has been studying under Ichthys for quite some time now, he doesn't have Greek or Hebrew.

##### Materials offered

Bible Crash Course is topically focused while Bible Academy is predominantly verse-by-verse. Additionally, Bible Academy tends to have series that are sometimes dozens of videos long, while the content on Bible Crash Course tends to be more standalone.

Many of the things Bible Crash Course talks about are among the difficult and controversial topics that are also emphasized on this site, such as eschatology (end times) and biblical chronology.

There are also resources on interpretation, such as [a series covering interpretation of various parables](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfNMMVvTNjCRuUheLVOoXmAnQYsghWWUz).

#### Writings from the desk of Bartek Sylwestrzak

Link to ministry: [Bartek's page on Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/bartek-sylwestrzak.htm)

##### Steven's take

Bartek is the most advanced of our younger generation of teachers, definitely the one with the most experience in Greek and Hebrew. Since he is an ex-Catholic, he has more insight into the problems of Catholicism than us lifelong Protestants.

Bartek is well-qualified in matters of Greek and Hebrew.

##### Materials offered

Thus far, Bartek has two big studies publicly posted: Spiritual Battle (which deals with combatting sin -- a most important topic) and a series dissecting problematic Catholic views of Mary.

#### Writings from the desk of Odii Ariwodo

Link to ministry: [Odii's page on Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/odii-ariwodo.htm)

##### Steven's take

Odii has a bit of a different perspective from those of us who grew up in the West, as he is from Nigeria. He was very active on a certain Nigerian forum for a number of years, sticking up for the truth in a rather challenging environment.

While Odii has been studying under Ichthys for quite some time now, he doesn't have Greek or Hebrew.

##### Materials offered

Currently, Odii has two foundational series posted (one on basic principles of Christianity, another on Christ and what he did for us), as well as a number of Q&As coming from the aforementioned forum. Many of these Q&A exchanges contain correspondents who are noticeably more hostile than those typically showing up in the Ichthys email postings, so these Q&As may be good examples for any folks wishing to see how to stick up for the truth in more antagonistic circumstances.

## Links related to personal Bible study

As an important introductory note in light of the large number of resources linked below, it is a *big* mistake to view collecting bibliography as making spiritual progress. To copy [Nike's marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Do_It), the approach to Bible study you should take first and foremost is "*JUST DO IT*." Your approach will not be perfect (whose is?). You could always be doing more (who cannot say the same?). There will no doubt be some things that you can't immediately wrap your head around (who does not have such things?).

But if you spend even 15 minutes a day reading your Bible, *every single day*, progress will come. The daily consistency is critical, as anyone who has tried to learn a foreign language can tell you. A half hour every day beats 4 hours on Saturday every time.

Now, personal Bible study is no replacement for taking in Bible teaching; with the exception of qualified and prepared teachers who have their own ministries in full swing, *everyone* needs a Bible teacher to listen to. It's how God has designed the system (compare Ephesians 4:11-13 -- since apostles and prophets are no longer around, and evangelists are focused on unbelievers not believers, by process of elimination...).

Even so, it is the duty of all lay Christians to be fully conversant with scripture so as to be able to verify the spiritual nourishment they receive from teachers (compare the Bereans of Acts 17:11). This is not to say that lay Christians truly get to play umpire as to what Bible teaching is true (that is not the point), but merely that biblical literacy is something to be highly valued and pursued -- even while simultaneously taking in solid Bible teaching like that offered by the ministries linked above. Both are critically important in spiritual growth.

The goal then with all of the resources below is more to enhance personal Bible study than to actually teach. By getting lots of good general background information here, Christians can turn to a good teaching ministry -- one that is providing substantive Bible teaching -- for all their other needs. You should keep this "personal Bible study resources ≈ general background information" rule of thumb in mind as this section progresses.

### Introduction to personal Bible study

* [Bible handbooks](https://laidlawlibrary.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/using-a-bible-handbook/)

Learning about learning is typically called "metalearning." While traditionally the province of time-strapped college students, metalearning in truth provides dividends no matter who you are. Who doesn't want to learn, more, better, in less time?

This site [maintains a personal Bible study metalearning page]() targeted specifically towards learning about various personal Bible study resources and techniques.
-->

### Resources for personal Bible study

<!--
I highly recommend reading/reviewing the above page describing different types of Bible study resources and their purposes before getting into the following sections. It's a formal prequisite.
-->

While this is mentioned repeatedly all over this site, it is worth here reiterating again that I *highly*, *highly* recommend doing Bible study on the computer, as discussed in more depth [here](/resource-index/#i-strongly-recommend-using-digital-resources-for-bible-study). For this reason, wherever possible, the resources linked below will be digital.

The subsections below contain specific resource recommendations, organized into four different groups based on price point. The resources offered to us for free are of such high quality nowadays that people without great means should, as a general rule, not feel like they are missing out greatly.

Much of the difference between the intermediate-cost resource sets and the most expensive one is convenience. If you can afford paying for the convenience, you *will* save a degree of time every day, and this adds up. But if you can't swing the difference, it's not the end of the world.

#### Personal Bible study resource recommendations if money is tight

##### Bible reading app

I recommend the [STEP Bible app](https://www.stepbible.org/) by Tyndale house. It has most of the main versions I find useful in comparisons (NASB, ESV, NIV, HCSB), only lacking NKJV and NLT. As will be seen below, it also has many useful Bible study features (like version-cross-references and an exhaustive original language concordance) baked-in directly, keeping many things in one single place.

##### Parallel versions

The STEP Bible app supports scrolling multiple versions in-line with each other for comparing longer sections of text:

![image-20201002075008938](C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Projects\bibledocs.org\content\links.assets\image-20201002075008938.png)

##### Textual comparisons

Textual comparisons are somewhat different from parallel versions, in that they focus on visually highlighting differences between versions/translations word by word rather than comparing them at a higher level (e.g., by section) as one does with parallel versions. The STEP Bible app also makes textual comparisons easy:

![image-20201002075145868](C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Projects\bibledocs.org\content\links.assets\image-20201002075145868.png)

##### Cross-references

Along with parallel versions and textual comparisons, I think that cross-references are critical to prioritize in Bible reading. Interpreting scripture with scripture is an absolutely essential part of growing in knowledge of the truth.

The STEP Bible app supports version cross-references in the left sidebar, connected to parts of the text with letter superscripts, like so:

![image-20200910181240789](C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Projects\bibledocs.org\content\links.assets\image-20200910181240789.png)

Most versions offered by the STEP Bible app have these version cross-references, although the NIV is a notable exception.

When you want a greater volume of cross-references than the version cross-references, you can check the [Treasury of Scripture Knowledge](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/tsk.html), available for free on [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/). In general, while the TSK is sometimes helpful, I find that version cross-references often get you the examples you want with less to wade through (less only-tangentially-related things), so I usually use them in lieu of the TSK. However, it can be helpful to check the TSK if you feel like you want more.

However, it can be helpful to check the TSK if you feel like you want more.

##### Exhaustive original language concordance

(Note: You do *not* need to know Greek and Hebrew to make use of this feature).

The STEP Bible app supports an exhaustive original language concordance right out of the box (at least for the most common English translations on the app, like ESV and NASB). Once you click on a clickable English word to see the gloss for the Greek or Hebrew word that it was translated from (this is the reverse interlinear mapping at work, even if you don't see the original languages actually displayed under the English), you can click on the number of occurrences in the right sidebar to see all the verse occurrences of that Greek or Hebrew word in the Bible, basically instantly.

![image-20200910225051943](C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Projects\bibledocs.org\content\links.assets\image-20200910225051943.png)

The best part is that since the concordance is based on the underlying Greek and Hebrew lemmas, you will be matching based on occurrences in the original languages rather than English words. A good example of why this is important can be seen from considering the word "love" in English. In the New Testament, three Greek words are commonly translated as "love" in English translations: στοργή, *storge* (familial love, as in that between parent and child), φιλία, *philia* (love between friends), and ἀγάπη, *agape* (divine unconditional love, as in loving someone you know you will never get anything back from). If we were to use a concordance based on the English word, we'd get hits for all three of the underlying Greek words all mixed together. But as it is, original language concordances (like the one employed by the STEP Bible app) will only match instances of one of the three Greek words for love (which one will depend upon what Greek word was behind the initial English "love" clicked), which is *much* more useful.

I use this concordance functionality very frequently, right alongside the cross-references mentioned in the last section. The version cross-references are usually a better overall place to start (the concordance doesn't match on meaning *per se*, just on underlying word), but the concordance, just like the TSK, can give you more verses to work with.

##### Finding verse locations

Something that happens *all the time* (at least to me) is remembering more or less what a passage of scripture says, but not remembering exactly where the passage is located. Oftentimes you want to check your remembrance/paraphrase to make sure you aren't mangling it, and also want to see the context. So how do you figure out where the passage is located in scripture?

Over time, I've realized that the answer to this question is actually simpler than you might think: rather than doing a text search in a Bible study app or bothering with an English concordance, I've found that the easiest and fastest way to identify the locations of passages is simply to Google a paraphrase of the passage, and then look at the verse locations that pop up.

For example, you might remember Jesus saying "I am the vine; you are the branches" but not remember what chapter of the New Testament this statement is in. Plugging this statement into Google will instantly spit back John 15, and then you can navigate there in your Bible reading app.

This section isn't a link to a resource so much as an encouragement to *not* try to find/buy something to do this particular task, which Google already does better and faster.

##### Study Bibles and study notes

* [NIV Study Bible in OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=59059)
* [FreeBibleCommentary.org Old Testament study notes](http://www.freebiblecommentary.org/old_testament_studies/written_commentaries.htm)
* [FreeBibleCommentary.org New Testament study notes](http://www.freebiblecommentary.org/new_testament_studies/written_commentaries.htm)

As a lay Christian, if you can only afford to buy one resource to use as a guide and aid to personal Bible study, it should probably be a study Bible. The study Bible recommended by Dr. Luginbill of Ichthys (which I have also made use of for a number of years now) is the NIV Study Bible, edited by Kenneth Barker. It can be purchased in the Bible software program [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/), as linked above. ([See here](/resource-index/#study-bible-s-and-bible-handbooks-olivetree) for a discussion on why OliveTree in this specific case when I [generally recommend](/resource-index/#which-bible-software-program-and-why) a different Bible software program called [Logos](https://www.logos.com/)).

Study notes and study Bibles are more or less the same thing, *mutatis mutandis*, which is why I group them together. [FreeBibleCommentary.org](http://www.freebiblecommentary.org/), offered courtesy of Dr. Bob Utley, offers somewhat-technical study notes on scripture that encourage depth and circumspection in the interpretative process. Using these alongside the NIV Study Bible will give you good supplementary information verse-by-verse, helping you get general background information that can make personal Bible study more effective.

##### Commentaries

<!-- I will here repeat the general warning from the [personal Bible study metalearning page]() that most commentaries are not useful. -->

While one can easily spend lots of money on shiny new commentaries, modern commentaries are oftentimes more spiritually harmful than they are helpful, inasmuch as commentators often do not have much respect for the authority of the Bible, and are theologically muddled. (I'm generalizing, but stand by these generalizations as a rule). Stuff from before WWII is typically more theologically conservative and less likely to be completely off-the-rails, but of course, YMMV.

Instead of relying on (in many cases) nameless commentators or committees (!) of them, it is prudent for individual Christians to find a teaching ministry that is actually teaching the truth in-depth, and supplement their own personal Bible reading with teaching from this ministry that they trust. After all, having academic knowledge of the truth does one little good; what is important is actually *believing* the truth.

With all this being said, not all commentaries are completely useless. I do recommend more commentaries below, but they aren't particularly cheap, so in this penny-pinching section, I'll limit myself to recommending the commentaries of Charles Hodge freely available on [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/):

* [Hodge on Romans](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/hdg/romans.html)
* [Hodge on Ephesians](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/hdg/ephesians.html)
* [Hodge on 1 Corinthians](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/hdg/1-corinthians.html)

Hodge is certainly scholarly, but I do find him better in systematics, which is what he is of course more well-known in. These commentaries are by no means perfect (so you should take what they say with a large helping of salt); for example, ignore the Calvinism herein (following the principle of taking that which is useful, while leaving that which is not).

##### Topical resources

Topical resources are as they sound: they organize lists of verse references by topic. You can think of them as more systematized collections of verse cross-references. There is a little bit of authorial discretion as to the organization (i.e., which/whether links go with a topic), but they are fairly free from interpretation.

I find that I don't use topical resources every time I read my Bible, but when I do use them, I am glad they exist, as they save me time and legwork. They are an excellent jumping-off-point for research on a specific subject.

I recommend most people make use of the topical resources freely available on [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/):

* [Torrey's Topical Textbook](https://www.studylight.org/concordances/ttt.html)
* [Nave's Topical Bible](https://www.studylight.org/concordances/ntb.html)
* [Thompson Chain Reference](https://www.studylight.org/concordances/tcr.html)

##### Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias

Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias are invaluable as reference works for when you want to get some background on some topic that comes up in scripture, like a place, cultural practice, archaeological feature, or other things of this sort. Sometimes study Bibles and study notes (and other in-line reference resources; see [Bible handbooks](#bible-handbooks) below) will be "enough" in terms of background information, but in those cases when they are not, Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias are where you should look for more information.

In a fortunate turn, most of the older free ones (those from the late 19th and early 20th century, which are now in the public domain) end up being better for the most part, as the older scholarship is more conservative and supportive of the authority of the Bible.

I recommend most people make use of the Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias freely available on [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/):

* Single-volume works, better for general background and reference:
  * [Smith's Bible Dictionary](https://www.studylight.org/dictionaries/sbd.html)
  * [Easton's Bible Dictionary](https://www.studylight.org/dictionaries/ebd.html)
  * [Hastings' Single-volume Bible Dictionary](https://www.studylight.org/dictionaries/hdb.html)
* Multi-volume academic works, better for serious research and more scholarly pursuits:
  * [The 1915 International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (ISBE1915)](https://www.studylight.org/encyclopedias/isb.html) (the newer 1995 version is one of the modern academic options)

Bible handbooks, study resources also organized in-line with the Biblical text, are sort of like study Bibles' older siblings, typically having even more in the way of timelines, maps, photographs, and illustrations, along with additional outlines and expositions of background information (on ancient culture and customs, e.g.). For this reason, it would be convenient to use them right alongside our study Bible(s).

Unfortunately, the digitized versions of these in OliveTree do not have particularly high resolution photographs, maps, and so on; while you can click on the images to enlarge them, the resolution does not increase. This is particularly problematic in the New Unger's Bible Handbook (an older resource, it seems), which has a small number of maps and timelines (for lines of Kings, for example), that are more or less illegible -- although most are fine. This is regrettable, but the advantages of the digital versions (particularly that sweet, sweet instant viewing of verse references) more than make up for this.

On top of the NIV Study Bible and study notes from FreeBibleCommentary.org, these two Bible handbooks will round out an excellent set of in-line reference resources that you can scroll alongside scripture to give you general background knowledge.

Upgrading from the older free Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias linked above gives you several things:

* Most of the more modern options have lots of photographs and graphics, things that the older options do not have. This is a biggie.
* The more modern options have some information (regarding, e.g., biblical archaeology) that was not yet available at the time the older options were written. The [Qumran Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), for example, were not discovered until the middle of the 20th century.
* While of debatable utility given modern scholarship's general lack of respect for inspiration and the authority of the Bible, the more modern options will give more modern bibliographies that link to academic writings that are more recent. (If nothing else, actually following academic references will likely be easier. Tracking down citations from scholarship that is many decades -- even centuries -- old can prove very onerous).
* While not unique to these more modern options, buying resources in Logos lets you sync them, which is a huge advantage. It makes sense to buy and sync more modern options (rather than here purchasing the older resources in Logos to sync) not only due to the advantages above, but also due to the fact that you can still reference all of the older free resources on StudyLight as before. Buying these more modern options thus expands the total number Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias you can reference from four to eight.

Lay Christians generally don't need more than the information provided in single-volume works. Having multiple different dictionaries can be useful in getting a fuller picture, as it is not uncommon for some resources to lack coverage (or at least more in-depth coverage) of specific topics. These four together are a good spread, all targeted towards providing straightforward background information without being overwhelming. (They are also all more on the conservative side of things, although all modern works suffer from a degree more liberal scholasticism than things pre-dating WWII).

Together with the NIV Study Bible, study notes from FreeBibleCommentary.org, and the two Bible handbooks, these reference resources should give all the background information you could ever really ask for as a lay Christian.

##### In-line topical resources

* [Thompson Chain Reference Bible](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17248)
* [Dictionary of Bible Themes](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=21231)
* [Olive Tree Bible Topic Threads](https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=40654)

([See here](/resource-index/#topical-resources-olivetree) for more discussion on in-line topical resources in general, and also why I am again recommending [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/) in this specific case when I [generally recommend](/resource-index/#which-bible-software-program-and-why) a different Bible software program called [Logos](https://www.logos.com/)). Scrolling topical resources alongside scripture makes using them much more convenient, as topically organized lists of verses are thus always only a single click away.

##### Unger's Commentaries

* [Unger's *Commentary on the Old Testament*](https://www.amazon.com/Ungers-Commentary-Testament-Merrill-Unger/dp/0899574157/)
* [Unger's *Commentary on the Gospels*](https://www.amazon.com/Ungers-Commentary-Gospels-Merrill-Unger/dp/0899576303)

Unger's *Commentary on the Old Testament* is quite good, and I recommend it, although unfortunately there is no digital version of it. It respects the authority of scripture and is fairly insightful, although not always perfect. It's hard to find though (and somewhat expensive, >=$100 used for the more recent hardcover publication, in my experience), as it's out of print.

Relatively recently (2014), a previously unpublished *Commentary on the Gospels* was published for the first time, also by Unger. (This publication is very much posthumous, as Unger passed in 1980; unfortunately, just like his *Commentary on the Old Testament*, this publication also has no digital version). I have less personal experience with this work than Unger's much-more-established *Commentary on the Old Testament*, and also have had less recommendations of the work from people whose opinions I trust. However, I have thus far found it to be useful. Unger was one of the unsung heroes of the last couple generations in terms of conservative scholarship that proceeded with a high view of inspiration. He also has a Bible dictionary to his name (recommended above), as well as a Bible handbook (also recommended above).

#### Personal Bible study resource recommendations if money is not a problem at all

Note: It is my recommendation that many people ignore this section and save their money. By having four syncing Bible dictionaries in [Logos](https://www.logos.com/), and the NIV Study Bible, two Bible handbooks, and three topical resources scrolling in-line with scripture in [OliveTree](https://www.olivetree.com/), the convenience factor is already there for the statistically most-utilized resources. Everything below is just icing on the cake.

##### Shifting into Logos for Bible study

While I highly recommend the STEP Bible app -- and it really does have most basic things one wants, like cross-references and an exhaustive original language concordance -- it is, after all, only a free webapp. If you have the money to buy your Bible versions in Logos (such that you can shift into Logos for Bible study), you will gain some functionality. For example:

* The ability to [save resource configurations and window arrangements](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016599631-What-are-Layouts-and-How-Do-I-Use-Them-) so that you can instantly open them back up whenever you want.
* The [Logos Passage Guide](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016462872-Passage-Guide)
* [Word studies for Greek](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016462892-Bible-Word-Study-Greek-)
* The ability to run [complex searches](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017808111-Bible-Search) and [clause searches](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017524912-Clause-Search)
* [Graphical visualization of search results](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018021791-Graph-Results)
* Etc.

Additionally, Logos lets you sync Bible versions not only in one parallel window, but across as many windows as you want (i.e., you can have Bible versions in minimized tabs that will still sync). Here's links for the reverse-interlinear-enabled (i.e., Greek and Hebrew tagged) Bible versions that I use in my version comparisons:

* [New American Standard Bible](https://www.logos.com/product/145180/the-new-american-standard-bible-nasb-reverse-interlinears-set)
* [English Standard Version](https://www.logos.com/product/154150/the-english-standard-version-with-reverse-interlinear)
* [New International Version, 2011](https://www.logos.com/product/154029/the-new-international-version-2011-with-reverse-interlinear)
* [Holman Christian Standard Bible](https://www.logos.com/product/154104/holman-christian-standard-version-with-reverse-interlinear)
* [New King James Version](https://www.logos.com/product/154030/the-new-king-james-version-with-reverse-interlinear)
* [New Living Translation](https://www.logos.com/product/154028/the-new-living-translation-with-reverse-interlinear)

Unlike the STEP Bible app, which doesn't offer NKJV and NLT, you can have access to all the versions seamlessly in Logos.

##### The Ultimate Cross Reference Treasury

Of all the comprehensive cross-reference tools I have come across (for example, the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge or TSK, mentioned above), a work called the [Ultimate Cross Reference Treasury](http://www.realbiblestudy.com/?p=2148) (UCRT) is by far the most complete.

Goofy name aside, this resource does something other cross-reference tools do not: it annotates the verse references as to their type. To quote a few examples from the documentation:

* "\* placed before a cross reference marks a very clear reference where the connection is usually immediately obvious. Beginning users are encouraged to use these references first. As more experience is gained, all the references may be consulted. Another important benefit of this emphasis marking is that when teaching a group and time is limited, these references are the most helpful to consider when time will not permit consulting them all."
* "\*\* placed before a cross reference indicate a critically clear very significant reference which should not be missed."
* "% marks a reference which contrasts in some way, perhaps another aspect of the subject, or a reference to the opposite subject."
* "$ identifies references which mark the fulfillment of prophecy."

And there are even more annotations than just these.

Oddly enough, the thing I have found this resource most useful for is tracking the usage of figures of speech like polysyndeton. The creator of the resource notes "It is believed that this new resource is the most comprehensive listing of the figures of speech in the Bible ever produced in English," and while I don't have much to compare it to, it certainly does well in this regard. Figures of speech can be rather important in interpretation, so it is helpful to be able to trace their usage like this.

The main downside of this resource is that it is [only available](https://estudysource.com/platform/site/product/products.aspx?pid=C0025) in the Bible software program called [e-Sword](https://www.e-sword.net/). While there's nothing wrong with e-Sword, and it is fine for what it is as a free Bible software program, I do wish this resource were offered in one of the more modern programs so that e-Sword weren't necessary. It's yet another Bible software program to run alongside OliveTree and Logos... I regularly have all three open at the same time! (Modern computers with >=8GB of RAM can easily handle it).

I never used the TSK very much relative to version cross-references, and while I do use this replacement for the TSK more since it somewhat solves one of the TSK's main problems (having too many links such that you're never sure which ones are actually likely to be useful, and in what way) via annotations, I still don't use it all that much overall, so it's definitely a luxury purchase. Version cross-references alone will still get you most of the way there.

##### Hodge's commentary on 2 Corinthians

[StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/), for whatever reason, offers Hodge's commentaries on Romans, Ephesians, and 1 Corinthians, but not his commentary on 2 Corinthians.

While you can continue accessing the other three for free, you can [buy Hodge's commentary on 2 Corinthians in Logos](https://www.logos.com/product/7036/an-exposition-of-the-second-epistle-to-the-corinthians).

##### Another more in-depth Bible dictionary

While ISBE1915 is available for free via [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/) (as linked above), Hastings' Multi-volume Bible Dictionary (not the single-volume one linked above -- they are different resources altogether) is not available for free anywhere online other than via suboptimal scans.

If you want another more in-depth option to compare ISBE1915 too, [purchasing this Bible dictionary in Logos](https://www.logos.com/product/6374/a-dictionary-of-the-bible) might be worth it. The main thing it has going for it over more modern multi-volume reference resources is that it is substantially cheaper (~\$35 vs \$150+). Since lay Christians shouldn't need to do too much in the way of serious academic reference, this is somewhat of a luxury purchase, but it may prove useful from time to time if you are diving deeper into something.

##### Buying free resources in Logos for syncing

It can be inconvenient to use multiple free resources for comparison on [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/) because resources do not synchronize with each other. If you have StudyLight's ISBE1915 open in one tab with StudyLight's Smith's Bible Dictionary open in another tab, if you search for "Aaron" (Moses' brother), say, in one of these tabs, the other will not automatically jump to Aaron.

Purchasing otherwise free resources in Logos can be worth it if you have the money, since Logos' automatic resource syncing can save a substantial amount of time in practice. Since all of these things are old and in the public domain, the Logos versions are not all that terribly expensive overall.

Links to purchase all the StudyLight Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias in Logos:

  * [Smith's Bible Dictionary](https://www.logos.com/product/1219/smiths-bible-dictionary)
  * [Easton's Bible Dictionary](https://www.logos.com/product/558/eastons-bible-dictionary)
  * [Hastings' Single-volume Bible Dictionary](https://www.logos.com/product/6388/dictionary-of-the-bible)
  * [The 1915 International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (ISBE1915)](https://www.logos.com/product/18410/the-international-standard-bible-encyclopedia-isbe-1915-edition)

Links to purchase all the (non-in-line) StudyLight topical resources in Logos:

* [Torrey's Topical Textbook](https://www.logos.com/product/26980/torreys-new-topical-textbook)
* [Nave's Topical Bible](https://www.logos.com/product/320/new-naves-topical-bible-20)

Even if you most commonly reference the more convenient in-line topical resources, using the conventional dictionary-style ones for comparison becomes much less onerous if they sync together automatically in Logos.
