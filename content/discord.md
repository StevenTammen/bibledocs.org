[Discord](https://discord.com/new) is a channel-based text, audio, and even video-chat application ideal for cultivating communities with shared interests.

I maintain a Discord server for this website. This server is not just for my personal friends, but for all people with an interest in the things discussed on this site. You can join the server with the following link: [Join StevenTammen.com Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WzPTbkV).

Please keep in mind that this server can be joined by anyone, without any formal vetting process. In other words, you should assume that the audience for what you write is the internet at large. I will do my best to keep the community civil and free of bad actors.
