title: Community Overview
---

All the teaching materials on this site (text, video, and audio) are always available for your use, no matter where you may be in the world or what your schedule may be like. There is absolutely nothing wrong with never getting more involved than simply accessing the materials on this site as you see fit.

For anyone who does want to get involved with a group of like-minded individuals also interested in these same things, however, this site does formally run a community.

At present, there are three primary community channels:

- A web forum
- A WhatsApp group
- Weekly meetings over Zoom (with local folks meeting in-person on one side of the call)

The following sections will go into more detail about all three of these things.

## Our forum

Link: https://community.bibledocs.org/

If conversations get a bit longer and more technical (relative to the somewhat more casual real-time conversations that happen on the WhatsApp group), it can be a good idea to move them onto the forum. The forum is great because it makes it easy to link back to past conversations over time (rather than having things get buried), and also supports splitting up conversations by topics/threads to keep all related discussion together. (Topics can also be independently categorized and tagged for future reference too, another plus in the content organization department).

There is a bit of a learning curve on the forum, but all the above advantages make it worth it. If you ever get intimidated, please don't be at all shy in reaching out to me or one of the other mods for help in getting familiar with the interface. We're here to help!

### Different forum sections

The forum is split into multiple different visibility-locked sections, based on user groups. Only people who belong to a given group can view the content within the corresponding section.

This is advantageous in fostering more productive discussion for a couple reasons. First off, shared sets of axioms and assumptions help make discussion proceed more smoothly. And perhaps more importantly, people will quite naturally tend to open up more with those who share their beliefs, leading to greater potential vis-Ã -vis the development of close relationships.

So it can be advantageous to have discussions only among groups of people who have lots in common, in other words. However, there is a flip-side to this. Having conversations among wider groups of people also brings more diversity of opinion (not always an unqualified good thing, but also not always an unqualified bad thing), and more importantly, makes it possible for conversations to benefit much larger numbers of Christians overall. What good is your excellent discussion if only five people can see it?

So there are honestly pros and cons both in having discussions among narrower groups of people and in having discussions among wider groups of people. Things are something of a spectrum. Sometimes perhaps you wish to discuss a more niche topic (something uncontroversial within your smaller group, but not among Christians generally, e.g.), and would rather keep the conversation focused on discussion rather than debating points you would otherwise wish to take for granted. But maybe sometimes you actually would rather make a case for your position with a wider audience, exposing it to many people who have perhaps never come across it.

Neither one of these desires is at all improper, so it is a decidedly good thing to be able to do either. And so that is exactly what our forum sectioning allows, in that it offers both narrower and wider sections.

In general order of widest to narrowest:

#### The Debate section

The debate section has the widest range of beliefs represented. All people participating here:

- Self-identify as Christian (so we do not engage in apologetics with Atheists and Muslims in this forum section, e.g.)
- Are willing to have conversations about what the Bible says and means (even if tradition and centralized high church authority, for example, play more of a role in their epistemologies than they do for us more hardcore *sola scriptura* Evangelicals)
- Are interested in developing their arguments and coming to better understand and refute opposing points of view

But that's about it in terms of enforced commonalities.

So, for example, you might find Catholic folks, Orthodox folks, Pentecostal folks, Church of Christ folks, Mormon folks, and others participating here, alongside mainline Protestants and Evangelicals and all other Christian points of view besides.

This section has some of the most heavy-handed moderation on the site, to keep things eminently civil. There is very little tolerance for being unnecessarily disrespectful, no matter how wrong you might find the other person.

##### Important note: despite being the most open in terms of beliefs, this is one of the smaller sections on the forum by number of overall participants

This is so for a couple reasons:

1) Always having one's beliefs under fire is not healthy for normal lay Christians who are not gifted and called to apologetics. It can, in fact, have the unfortunate consequence of making one unsure of everything, which makes it very hard to make forward spiritual progress. So for this reason, we do not suggest that most people participate here without first demonstrating a reasonably high level of maturity and certainty in their own beliefs, and an accompanying keen interest in the sort of formal debate that governs interaction in this section.

2) Even among people who might be able to handle it spiritually, not everyone is able to participate in formal disagreements without falling into communication patterns that somewhat undercut productive interaction. If that's too wordy, the basic gist is that some people give offense too easily, even if not intentionally. It's tricky to not take things personally when someone rips apart your argument, but we do try to give grace where possible so that the focus always stays on the truth, not personalities. It is simply a fact of life that some people have a harder time than others engaging in sharp disagreement in a manner glorifying Christ, and that's all we shall say on the subject. It doesn't make some people better than others, it just makes some people a better fit for this forum section than others. We must be a bit choosy so as to avoid having arguments get out of control.

Together, these things mean we gatekeep this section a bit more than most of the others, to jealously guard the productive and respectful atmosphere that we have built, while also making sure we don't unintentionally shake people up by exposing them to fierce theological disagreements before they are really ready to see them.

#### The Protestants section

As one might expect, Protestants tend to have more things in common with each other than with the other Christian belief systems you might encounter in the Debate section. In particular, Protestants tend to rely on the Bible alone to a relatively higher than degree than most other categories of Christians, making discussion that centers on scripture that much more focused.

This is the largest section on the forum by number of overall participants. There tends to be somewhat of a divide in perspective between so-called "Mainline Protestants" (from centralized denominations like Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and so on), and non-denominational Evangelicals and their sort, but all parties do still share a nice wide swath of common ground that makes conversation productive in a wide-group sense.

#### The Ichthys and Friends section

Narrower still, we have a forum section for folks that are readers of [Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com), or follow associated ministries with similar teachings:

- This ministry (BibleDocs)
- [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg)
- Etc.

We all tend to believe certain things that Protestantism writ large might find controversial. This means we can occasionally have a much easier time discussing things only amongst ourselves, rather than trying to have conversations in a more open context that might invite constant challenges and tangential arguments about things that we all tend to take for granted and have no interest in debating.

#### The Teachers section

Finally, we have the narrowest section, composed of teachers preparing for or engaging in ministry under Ichthys and related ministries. (Note that the people involved here are not only people occupying the formal office of Pastor-Teacher in the Church, but also other believers whose ministries call them to teach regularly, including some women who teach other women and children).

Put simply, those people who have grown to spiritual maturity under these ministries (and are now endeavoring to teach others) have probably "drunk the Kool-Aid" more than others, with a much deeper formal understanding of all teachings (rather than just a smaller slice of the pie), and accompanying thirst to have complicated discussions about some of the finer points therein.

Deeper conversations about things can happen in this Teachers section without plugging up the wider Ichthys and Friends section with a lot of technical discussion that won't be relevant to most lay Christians.

It also helps to keep certain conversations limited to teachers alone, for the same sort of reason as why it might not be the most appetizing for diners to peer back behind the kitchen curtain in a restaurant. If Christian teachers are cooks and their teachings food that has been effortfully prepared from raw ingredients, then seeing too much of the preparation process may make diners lose some of their appetite. In other words, to a degree, it is best to only place the appetizing finished product before them, and leave much of the preparation process out of sight and mind.

## Our WhatsApp group

Our community is international in scope and globally-minded, with folks from

- The US
- The UK
- Nigeria
- Australia
- Etc.

We use WhatsApp because it supports talking (voice-over-IP), video, and text chat for folks across the world, without needing to worry about expensive international phone plans and the like. WhatsApp is used quite a lot internationally (although perhaps not quite as much in the US, for whatever reason).

Unlike the forum, which is split into sections (as described above), we just have a single WhatsApp group, containing anyone from any of the forum sections who wish to participate. It is a wider group, in other words.

The fact that the WhatsApp group is generally more casual, the fact that conversation often (but not always) consists of prayer requests and announcements and other such things rather than longer discussions, and the fact that the medium is a bit more impermanent generally (over time, things get covered by new discussion) -- these reasons and several others help some in keeping the group productive despite the large variety of people who may participate. At least that is the goal.

Sometimes people end up directly messaging or calling each other too. That can be a very positive thing. We do ask that people respect the privacy of others though, and be careful to only get more individually involved if both sides truly want it.

<!-- WhatsApp doesn't itself support much in the way of searching through and organizing past conversations, but it does have a plaintext export feature. I manually clean up the chat export and format it as a searchable HTML page so that we can still find things from past conversations. This file is kept up-to-date on the relevant pinned thread on the forum. (Don't worry, some text-editor magic means it really doesn't take me that long). -->

## Joining our community

### Joining our private community requires formal invitation, and access can be revoked

Requiring registration (rather than allowing anonymous posts) can help minimize spammers, but it can't stop truly malicious users. For this reason, for any online community to be truly secure, it must be possible to completely remove users after-the-fact (without any lingering access), and therefore be invite-only rather than completely open and public. If a wolf in sheep's clothing pretends to be interested, there is no way to exclude them upfront without also running the risk of excluding people we wouldn't ordinarily want to exclude. So instead, we need a way to remove the sheep-dressed wolves if ever they should bare their fangs.

Ours is a community dedicated to Christian love and fellowship, and I am therefore completely unwilling to expose people to the slightest harm, even potential harm. For this reason, our community is much, much more private than many other online communities, and does require getting formally invited before one can participate.

Fear not though, there is no high bar here, and interest is really the only true requirement.

### Lurking is more than acceptable

Many people already involved in the community don't post much, but just read what others write. *There is nothing wrong with this*, and in fact, while we'd love to hear from all who wish to share their views, we're happy to just have people listening too. It makes us feel like what we do has meaning.

So please, if you are on the fence because you don't think you have the time to really post much or participate, don't let that be a barrier. Come and lurk with us. It's fun.

### The registration form

If you fill out the form below, I will invite you to the forum and/or the WhatsApp group (depending upon what information you provide). The email address is needed for registering on the forum, and the phone number for WhatsApp. (You can choose to fill out only one field and then participate through only one channel, if you so wish. You can always contact me later to get added to the other too).

With regard to the forum, you can here request access to the different forum sections ([explained above](#different-forum-sections)). Even if you do not check any of these boxes (such that I only add you to the common/shared section of the forum), you will still be able to see announcements and prayer requests, but I would nonetheless recommend participating in at least one of the discussion sections. It's what they are there for.

The only section that I won't just add you to by request is the Debate section. Since vetting is more important for this section, if you request access here (and I do not already know you well, or another Debate section member knows you and can vouch for you), I will reach out to talk to you a bit. This is not just for protection on our side (to make sure that everyone involved properly understands the respectfulness we require in disagreements, and things like that), but also for protection on your side, to make sure that you really know what you are signing up for. Fierce theological disagreements can be unsettling, so we just want to make sure that all who end up here will be energized by the environment, rather than oppressed by it. Apologies if this seems too nanny-state to you.

(To be clear, with regard to this screening for the Debate section, this isn't an interview or interrogation; I'll probably talk more than you. We admit almost all people who want to join. We just want people to go in with their eyes open).

I highly recommend signing up for all sections that apply to you, rather than just sticking with one. Since the different sections all have slightly different focuses, you can benefit from being able to see discussion in each of them. 

I do not share the information received through this form with anyone. Please note that filling out this form to join our community is not the same as signing up for the BibleDocs mailing list. You can read more about the BibleDocs mailing list [here](/mailing-list).

Non-US people: please [provide your country code](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/international-calling-codes/) in your mobile phone number (including the plus). So, for example, a UK number entered into the form might look like `+44 000-000-0000` (not a real number, but that's the format).

Links to join our weekly Zoom meetings are posted on the forum in a specific announcements thread and also posted on the WhatsApp group, so once you are active in at least one place, you will be able to join the Zoom meetings. We'll talk about our community's meetings next.

## Our meetings

### Quick reference

Here are links to a calendar of meeting dates and times, and a map of how to get to my house where the in-person meetings are held:

- [Link to the Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=64glk00tql51oucld0l2rorhr0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York)
- [Link to the location to navigate to on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/W3vS8Qb2oPGcqpqB9)

These things are also embedded below for quick reference:

The house should be easy to spot since the house number (101) is in white lettering on my black mailbox -- take care not to show up at one of my neighbors' houses!

To join over Zoom, you'll need the link to the Zoom meeting (which changes week to week), so you'll need to be active on either the forum or the WhatsApp Group, where the weekly Zoom link gets posted. You can read about how to join the forum and WhatsApp group [just above](#joining-our-community).

### Scheduling updates, practical info, prayer requests, etc. are typically disseminated through the WhatsApp group

[One of the sections above](#joining-our-community) discusses how to join our community, including getting added to the WhatsApp group. [A different section](#our-whatsapp-group) gives an overview of the WhatsApp group.

### The meeting schedule

We avoid Sunday meetings so that people don't have to make an exclusive choice between our fellowship and their other church groups, but can benefit from both, if so desired.

While we do typically give people a few minutes to trickle in, we will actually start reasonably close to the scheduled times, so just plan accordingly. It is least disruptive for everyone if most people are there when we start, but if you do end up running a bit late for whatever reason, just try to slip in quietly while minimizing the amount you disturb others as best you can. It's alright â life happens.  

<!--

#### Our Bible study meetings

##### Serious, formal study

For various reasons that we shan't get into here, there are not a great many meeting options available presently for people who wish to study the scriptures in a deeper and more technical way -- more in the manner of formal academic lectures than motivational speaking.

There is nothing wrong *per se* with spending time on the basics -- Christian self-sacrificing love, God's love for us through His Son and His sacrifice on the cross -- but we are called to learn more of God's truth than just the very basic things. Our goal should be a thorough understanding of the entirety of scripture -- a lifelong task that we will never complete in totality.

In pursuit of such a goal, our Bible studies are definitely on the more formal side of things. We do not try in any way to make them unapproachable or unnecessarily erudite or complex, but it is true that the focus is on getting a deeper technical understanding, rather than staying at the surface level in an attempt to be more accessible.

##### Equipping and training

In this, we try to focus especially on equipping people to go back to their other communities to teach and lead others in turn, with the end goal that a focus on and deeper knowledge of the truth takes increasingly greater hold across other local communities.

Going that level deeper in serious Bible study -- the form of study that sometimes goes underrepresented in other forms of church gatherings -- makes it possible for a "ripple effect" of sorts to take hold.

##### Finding true (rather than only apparent) unity in the truth

The body of Christ is in fact composed of all people who truly believe. However, from wandering around local areas, one might be forgiven for thinking that the body of Christ is instead composed of a plurality of separate groups that co-exist without much interaction among each other.

It's not that we want to encourage a form of ecumenism where truth is the casualty; quite to the contrary, the truth in the Word of God is the very thing that unites us. If we focus our hearts and minds upon learning, believing, and applying the Bible -- to the exclusion of most all else -- we will find that it is easy to find ourselves running side-by-side with a wide variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds.

In other words, if we dive deep into the Word of God (with that as essentially the only focus), we will see superficial differences fade as the truth takes front-and-center.

Finding this form of fully-realized unity in the truth (no matter our other differences) can be considered another primary goal of these Bible studies. It is a beautiful thing.

-->

### Our fellowship meetings

#### Overview

<!-- While the Bible Studies embody the more formal side of our community meetings, the fellowship meetings embody the more personal side of things. -->

For the time being, our community is just running informal fellowship meetings rather than a formal Bible study. Getting the website and YouTube channel more stable is something I wish to have in hand before committing to additional weekly meetings for a formal Bible study, but that will probably come to happen in time.

In our fellowship meetings, we talk through situations going on in each other's lives, and encourage and exhort one another in the truth. We do still try to keep the Bible in view at all times, but a greater emphasis is placed on discussing it in terms of the specific situations actually going on in our lives. We also often get sidetracked on theological conversations about anything and everything -- since there is no set structure or schedule in our fellowship meetings, we freely and enthusiastically follow rabbit trails. You are also welcome to come with questions about whatever spiritual topics you wish, as at least a couple teachers are usually participating on any given week.

We have a wide variety of men and women across ages and cultures represented in our fellowship meetings, and everyone is welcome to come and chat about the Bible with us more casually.

#### Why Saturday afternoons?

We have our fellowship meetings on Saturday afternoons primarily because this is when the most people globally can make it. Places in Africa and Europe tend to be around ~5-6 hours ahead of EST/EDT, and Australia (depending on which coast you are on) is about 14 hours ahead (so Saturdays for us are Sundays for them).

Saturday afternoons are thus the time during the week when we are likely to be able to chat with the largest group of English-speaking individuals.

### Information related to joining us in person

We meet at my house, which has been set up to handle larger volumes of people. <!--, both in terms of dining, and also in seating people for our meetings. -->

<!-- 
#### Shared meals

Anyone coming in-person is welcome to join us for a meal before the evening Bible studies on Friday and Saturday. The food is provided, although we do encourage anyone who can afford to help out to chip in to keep things sustainable (we support Venmo, PayPal, Cashapp, etc.). I will usually send out a poll on the WhatsApp group a bit earlier in the week to get a rough head-count for both days, so that we will have a better idea of how much food to prepare.
-->

#### Parking

When parking, try not to block any of the driveways of my neighbors, and try to park somewhere in front of my house rather than in front of someone else's house (so that we don't get in trouble with the folks that live around me).

If there is space on my driveway, we do encourage people to park there (it will fit two cars side-by-side for two layers deep -- although it's a bit tight -- and then another two single cars after that, for a total of 6), although do keep in mind that you may get boxed-in, which might prove inconvenient if you need to leave partway through or need to make your exit promptly at the end of our meeting due to another schedule obligation. The driveway is pretty steep for some of its length, so parking with the parking brake on may be necessary, depending on where you end up.

<!--
#### Childcare

I am very open to figuring out how to best accommodate children given our meetings, but thus far have no system in place.

You can [contact me](/contact) to discuss things further if this will be something important for you.

-->

### Information related to joining us online over Zoom

Let me emphasize: you *do not* need to be local and in-person to enjoy our fellowship! All of our meetings are tied-in to Zoom, so everyone is welcome to join us, no matter where you may be in the world.

We use a different meeting room every week to protect our privacy. The link to join the Zoom meeting is sent out to the WhatsApp group every week, as well as going in a specific announcements thread on the forum. You are welcome to join from a desktop or laptop computer, or from your phone. Whatever works best for you.

We do ask that most people stay muted when not talking, especially if you have noise around you.

<!--
#### Meeting recordings

All of our Bible study meetings are recorded and posted publicly on YouTube. This not only lets a wider audience benefit from our discussions, but also lets people who miss a week for whatever reason easily get caught back up.

(Note: the more personal fellowship meetings are not recorded, to help protect people's privacy, and to encourage everyone to open up a bit more and be comfortable talking casually).

Because the Bible studies are recorded and posted publicly, we try to keep things to just first names, and the conversation steered away from the deeply personal. I remind everyone every week to be watchful as to what is said when the recording is rolling, and always carefully announce when we are starting the recording to make sure people are never caught off-guard by such.

Because it is beneficial, we do typically have some discussion between "takes" on the recording, meaning I will pause the recording at certain points to let everyone have a chance to ask questions or just share their thoughts without the pressure of having their words forever memorialized on YouTube. You needn't feel bad about only talking when the recording is not rolling, as this pattern is in fact somewhat encouraged, to make sure the videos we create and share are largely focused and on-topic. Occasionally we do get a bit off-topic and end up not formally recording as much for a given week, which is fine too.

One important note: if you ever join one of our meetings late, do be conscious of the fact that the recording may already be rolling when you join. It is safest if you always act like the recording is in fact active, until such a time as you are sure it is not. Usually you will be able to figure out relatively quickly whether it is or not (one rule of thumb: if it's mostly only me talking, and I'm actually going through slides or talking about something pretty formally, we are very likely recording), but it is just better to be safe than sorry. I can edit things out in post if I absolutely have to, but it is time-intensive and unpleasant, so I very much prefer to not have to do such.  -->

## The general idea of different forum sections

The forum is split into multiple different visibility-locked sections, based on user groups. Only people belong to the respective group can view the content within each given section.

This is advantageous in fostering more productive discussion for a couple reasons:

### Shared sets of axioms and assumptions help make discussion proceed more smoothly

When everyone in a particular discussion agrees on a certain set of axioms and assumptions that can be taken for granted, conversation can proceed more smoothly in many ways. You don't need to define terms nearly so much, nor be constantly justifying the general reasonableness of your positions. For example, if you were to stick me in a very adamantly Catholic group of people, since I would tend to strongly disagree with a great deal, I would find it very hard to restrain myself from constantly asking pointed questions that would no doubt derail the conversations of all the other folks in the group. These people would all tend to already mostly agree with each other, and no doubt tire of defending basic facets of their beliefs to me.

Rather than make pretend that we all must try to clasp hands with one another and come to some form of fake unity, it is much better to instead acknowledge that the truth is inherently divisive, and many worldviews are completely mutually exclusive. For expedience of discussion, therefore, we simply encourage most conversation to happen only within the groups that it is likely to actually be relatively productive in, without underlying assumptions getting constantly challenged.

Summarized as a pithy principle, the sentiment would tend to be "don't kick the beehive." If you have to seriously ponder whether or not you are kicking the beehive, you are probably kicking the beehive.

(To be fair, exactly what is or is not "controversial" within a given group is a very imprecise, subjective matter. And it's not like all people who might self-identify with a label will believe precisely the same things anyhow. But nonetheless, hopefully the basic desire for "mostly only discuss given topics with those relatively unlikely to immediately come at you with pitchforks for discussing them" has been communicated).

### People will tend to open up more with those who share their beliefs

This is simply a common-sense fact. Even as much as it is good to come to an understanding of differing points of view such that one might have intelligent conversations with people of all walks (and so forth), it is nonetheless true that closeness comes most easily with those who truly understand and agree with you.

So visibility-locking discussions to smaller groups of users is not only a matter of discussion efficacy, but also one of efficacy in forming closer relationships. It sounds almost Machiavellian to put things in terms of me "plotting out ways to get people to reveal themselves more and get more invested with each other," but that really is more or less the sentiment here.

The easier it is for people to listen to and respect each other and bond over a shared understanding of things, the easier it is for them to develop deeper connections with one another.

## "But what about...?"

Here is my attempt to address to a couple common questions that naturally arise from such an organizational principle:

### "Doesn't artificially creating pockets of similarity lead to dangerous echo chamber effects?"

This ministry and those "in-network" are all very, *very* anti-cult. Blind groupthink is almost inestimably dangerous, and something to be most assiduously avoided.

So does setting up guidelines for artificially restricting cross-belief interactions necessarily lead to cult-like groupthink? It's not a question that should be sneered at and dismissed without serious thought, waving one's hand dismissively. No, indeed, the question is a fair one. 

See, here's the thing though. This community is completely opt-in (people can leave at any time). It is completely not-for-profit. It does not do a great deal of advertising, does not try to exert any kind of influence (e.g., political or financial), and does not tolerate any sort of member-on-member guilt-tripping or emotional blackmail and the like (that will get you insta-banned, I promise).

And on top of all this, I can speak for myself and the mods and say that we make every effort to *not* shove our beliefs down everyone else's throats in a top-down fashion. There is no pressure or coercion, with outright shaming and mocking of people who disagree.

We will just never back down from what we believe to be the truth (even if it means disagreeing), or apologize for it. And we will make every effort to ensure that people are able to have peaceful, productive conversations among those who are actually interested, for the sake of all who participate.

This makes the management approach here distinctly more opinionated than many other places that pretend neutrality (even though they are never really truly neutral, IMHO). Indeed, we will move or close threads that seem to us to be inflammatory or against the spirit of a specific narrower section, for no other reason than that the conversation doesn't belong in the scope of the section as we've defined it.

This actually would be problematic if we were nothing but self-interested tyrants who cared for money and power (etc.) rather than Christians wishing to promote more effective discussions and relationships among people in the body of Christ. Perhaps the claim that we as community leadership are not in fact such selfish individuals may not sound convincing when coming from our own mouths, but the distinction really does make all the difference in the world as to how these sorts of intentionally-homogenous communities play out in practice.

### "So this forum only offers these beneficial smaller groups for some systems of belief. Isn't that unfair?"

For example, we have a narrower section for only Protestants, but no narrower section for only Catholics or only Orthodox folks or only Mormons, etc. What's more, we have a narrower section for only people who follow this ministry (BibleDocs), [Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com), and other ministries that teach similar things, but no narrower section for only Baptists or only Lutherans or only Presbyterians.

I just argued above that having group-limited discussion is beneficial, right? So why don't we support such discussion among a wider variety of visibility-locked groups?

The main reason is simply one of practical feasibility. It takes time and effort to set communities up and moderate them responsibly. On account of this, you'll have to forgive us for focusing our limited resources on providing the very best experience we can for those areas that we view to be the most important. Those of us running things here tend to be Protestants at least somewhat in the orbit of [Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com), hence the groups that we do in fact have.








But ultimately, the main reason why I will never offer this service is one of voting with my feet. I do not believe all belief systems are equally worthy of support, even all belief systems that claim the banner of Christianity.

Tell me, would you, as a Christian, make the same argument about providing a platform and technical support for Muslims and Atheists? How about people a little closer to home, like Jehovah's Witnesses?

We lie to ourselves if we say things are categorically different among groups that claim Christianity. The unity we are supposed to share is in the *truth*. On judgment day, I do not wish to stand before the Throne and have to explain why my actions aided and abetted the spread of Satanic lies, coming as they may be through the mouths of 





It is a spectrum, to be sure, but the general principle is the same even when applied to groups like Catholics and Orthodox folks. I am fairly certain 



 The reason why this forum offers *any* wider groups at all is because I believe that these things may be of great use to serious believers who align with my beliefs, not so much because I inherently value building bridges across belief systems and so on.






 Far from it.

Put simply, I will never leverage my time, energy, and ability towards ends that I determine to do more harm than good. In much the same way most people would never leverage their resources to aid a terrorist organization, so too here. Please understand, I am not saying anyone who doesn't agree with my exact set of doctrinal beliefs is a terrorist. The point is that 


## Over time, it makes finding materials of interest easier for all parties





There will be some cases of gray upon section borders, but in general, the idea is to avoid going in pointless circles 




1. It is easier to form closer-knit relationships with people that you have more in common with. People tend to open up more with those who share their beliefs and focuses. We have to be careful to foster neither too much of an echo-chamber effect nor fractiousness within the body of Christ, but by and large, it is all to the good to encourage smaller closer-knit groups for the sake of Christian fellowship.
2. Having different sections makes it much easier to demarcate




There are three main sections on the forum: a section for wider discussion of the Bible among believers, a section for people more formally on-board with the teachings of this ministry and [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com), and a debate section. 

When invited, everyone starts out in the first general discussion section. Over time -- upon request, or once I get to know you better -- I may add you to one of the other sections (you won't lose access to the main discussion section). The other two sections are restricted in visibility for slightly different reasons:

- Regarding the section for people more formally on-board with the teachings of this ministry and [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com), we are able to better discuss the specifics of what we believe and help one another learn if we don't have to constantly defend the teachings themselves from skeptical parties. It is more intended as a community of students helping one another learn than a discussion board. (Different purpose).
- Regarding the debate section, it takes a certain sort of personality and mindset to do well in an environment of sharp disagreement and formal debate (in particular, a willingness to make certain concessions in how conversation proceeds for the purpose of keeping the peace). It is honestly not the best place for many normal Christians, and for that reason, it is kept mostly to people who truly want to be involved in constant arguments regarding the truth to sharpen their own positions and to better understand opposing positions so as to be able to argue against them more effectively. (Again, different purpose).

As a rule of thumb, if you are part of a group that tends to disagree sharply with Evangelical Protestantism writ large (things like *sola fide*, *sola scriptura*, and so on) -- for example, Orthodox folks, Catholic folks, Mormons -- you are still welcome on the forum, but we do ask that the general discussion section be kept free from arguments about things that most Evangelical Protestants take for granted. That's a bit hand-wavy (and the lines are admittedly blurry -- define "most"), but just be aware that the boundary between discussion of scripture amongst a somewhat homogenous group of Christians sharing a strong belief in the Bible (the general discussion section) and arguments about anything and everything amongst a much less homogenous group (the debate section) will be strongly enforced. If you are ever unsure, you can always ask, or just err on the side of caution and post straight to the debate section. Myself and the mods will move improperly-located threads at our discretion, and if it becomes a repeated problem, you will hear from us. I doubt we'll have huge issues, but please do try to operate within the goals of the framework as it has been established.
