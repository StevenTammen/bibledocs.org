## Summary {#summary}

1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 is one of passages of scripture that most clearly condemns sexual immorality. (1 Corinthians 6:12-20 is another). Sexual sin is no small matter in the eyes of God, and we must take pains to remember that, given our culture's ever-laxer attitude towards it.

### No matter what our culture says, sexual immorality ought to be avoided at all costs {#no-matter-what-our-culture-says-sexual-immorality-ought-to-be-avoided-at-all-costs}

1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 makes it clear that:

- God desires that we be sanctified, avoiding sexual immorality so that we might control our bodies in a way that is holy and honorable
- God punishes those who commit sexual sins
- Those who do not heed God's instructions in this area do not reject a human being, but God Himself.

This is perhaps more relevant in our culture now then in most times and places throughout human history. The culture in which the Bible was written---that is, a world that had been dominated first by Greece, and then by Rome---had plenty of sin in this area as well (perhaps more than many cultures since, up until recently). However, nowadays, we are constantly bombarded with advertising, movies, and other things of the world that tell us that we should do what we want, what gives us pleasure. "*It's natural*", they say.

Like the Thessalonians, however, these words apply to us. Whenever we feel the siren song of temptation in this area, we need to keep in mind these things that Paul reminds his readers about in this passage.

### 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 as a parallel passage {#1-corinthians-6-12-20-as-a-parallel-passage}

It is also good to compare 1 Corinthians 6:18, which says that unlike many other kinds of sin, the sexually immoral person *sins against his own body*. Actually, it is profitable to consider all of 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 as we examine this matter, as it is very parallel to the warnings against sexual immorality present in this passage in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8:

- Our bodies are not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord (1 Corinthians 6:13).
- Our bodies are members of Christ himself. Shall we then take the members of Christ, and unite them with a prostitute? Never! (1 Corinthians 6:15).
- Whoever sins sexually sins against his own body (1 Corinthians 6:18).
- Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who indwells us (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- We are not our own, but were bought at a price [^price], so we need to honor God---our owner and redeemer---with our bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).

[^price]: A very steep price, actually: the blood of Christ upon the cross. We cannot properly appreciate the true magnitude of this sacrifice---what it took to atone for the very least of our individual sins (much less the sins of the whole world). But we should act according to the understanding that the price paid for us is greater than we can even imagine; if we have the least bit of honor, we must strive as best we can to live worthy of the price that has been paid for us.
