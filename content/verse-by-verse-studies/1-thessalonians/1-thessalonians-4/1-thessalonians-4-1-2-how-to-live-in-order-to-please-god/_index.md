We are not to take this as some special thing that Paul is talking about. It is nothing more than following the instructions given to us in the Bible (and no doubt expanded upon by Paul's teaching when he was physically with the Thessalonians).

For us nowadays, since we do not have the Apostles to guide us, we rely solely on Word of God to determine how to live in order to please God.

So what does the Word of God have to say about all this? A good place to start with is with is the passage enumerating the so-called "greatest commandments":

**29** Jesus replied, “This is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. **30** Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ **31** The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.”

1 John 5 is also very relevant:

**2** This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. **3** In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands.

Do not be deceived: "love" is not some airy-fairy feeling. It is not mere emotion. It is obedience and submission and *keeping the Commands of God*. If we would wish to please God, we must follow what He instructs us to do. After all, how do soldiers please their superiors here in the physical world? By carrying out their orders with excellence and distinction. In the same way, we are Christian soldiers, and Jesus Christ is our Commanding Officer (and never a better Commanding Officer has there ever been nor shall there ever be). So why do we imagine that pleasing God will be anything other than obedience? That somehow we can just "love Him" (I suppose entailing thinking warm fuzzy thoughts, putting on a show of praise and "worship", and paying lip service to God) but not bother with learning and then submitting to all the Bible teaches?

The vast majority of self-professed Christians today do not know very much of what the Bible teaches---not really. Just be truly honest and look around (and perhaps inward). And if we humans know God's Commands only through His Word, then this means that people who don't really know what the Bible teaches aren't very familiar with what God commands of us. And if they aren't very familiar with what God commands of us, they can't keep His Commands properly. And if they don't keep His Commands properly, the Bible says they don't love God. (If not in an all-or-nothing fashion, certainly in a relative sense; people "do not love God" to the exact extent that they flout His Commands as a direct consequence of not even bothering to try to fully learn what they might be).

Can you be saved if you don't love God---if you don't do what God commands of us? James 2:14-26 speaks of those who say they "have faith" (without it being accompanied by works), and that that alone will save them. Such "faith" is dead (James 2:17). In other words, it is, in truth, no true faith at all. Since all true faith leads to "works of faith" (**Note**: these are *not* primarily what things people tend to think of with blinders on, like giving money to the poor---the examples James uses are Abraham offering up his only son upon the altar, and Rahab sheltering the Jewish spies from capture and death; the thing in common is the immense faith these actions took), someone who claims "faith" without any works of faith is simply deluding themselves.

This is not to make us all walk around questioning our salvation. If you just believe the gospel message, you are saved---the Bible is very clear about that (cf. John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-10). But we do need to be brutally honest with ourselves about exactly how "alive" our faith is. Because James 2 clearly links the "health of our faith plant" (cf. the Parable of the Sower and John 15:1-17) with how much we work out our faith. If we say we believe, but behave the exact same way as the unbelievers (and share their exact same priorities), well "how much" do we believe, really?

Let me use an analogy. Let's say you somehow knew a particular stock was certain to go up 900% in the next week. If you *actually* believed this, would you not do everything in your power to buy as much of it as you possibly could, to maximize your return? Wouldn't you look at someone really funny if they said that they "really" believe this (pinky promise)... but then buy none of the stock whatsoever? Would you not think to yourself, "This person doesn't really believe this, because if they did, their behavior would be different"?

So, tell me, why do we as Christians tend to be so unwilling to apply that same logic to our faith in God? The Bible certainly does, so we should too. So that we do not lie to ourselves and live lives unworthy of the immeasurable price Christ paid to redeem us from our sin and just condemnation. So that we ensure that we live lives pleasing to God as good Christian soldiers.

And we should do this *despite* what everyone else around us might be saying. For example, most modern churches won't agree with the assessment that most of the Church visible is steeped in lukewarmness and ignorance of the Bible, despite it being objective truth. Do you imagine that they will be happy when you say that it is all about the truth of the Word of God, when in fact most modern churches put their time and focus and money on many, many things other than that? Many modern churches barely teach anything of substance at all, and those that do either teach so many false things or keep their focus on such a narrow subset of what the Bible teaches---e.g., about such happy topics as marriage and love and family---that they too ought to be ashamed.

Put bluntly, if you follow things here to their logical conclusion, you won't fit it in at most modern churches, since most modern churches really only pay lip service to the teaching of the full truth of the Word of God. But that's OK, since *we are out to please God, not men*. Because we know that true worship (as opposed to whatever it is people imagine it to be) is dedicating our lives as living sacrifices to God, being transformed in our thinking by the power of His Word (Romans 12:1-3, and cf. John 4:23-24). That people somehow think we can "renew our minds" in any way other than the hard work of learning, believing, and applying the Bible to our lives (and then helping others do likewise) is why many self-professed Christians will never worship God as He actually wishes for them to (despite all their supposed "worship"), and will consequently never really live in order to please God. Let us not be among that number.
