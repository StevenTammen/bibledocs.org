## Summary {#summary}

Genesis 1:1 (in the original Hebrew and Greek Septuagint both) and John 1:1 do not have direct articles, meaning the texts read "a beginning" not "the beginning." This supports the idea that the beginning referred to is the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe, not the beginning of the material universe itself. Making this clear guarantees that people properly understand that God transcends space and time (things of His own creation), rather than Himself being somehow bound by the material universe.

### The "beginning" mentioned in Genesis 1:1 (and also John 1:1) is indefinite not definite {#the-beginning-mentioned-in-genesis-1-1-and-also-john-1-1-is-indefinite-not-definite}

Genesis 1:1 is the first verse in the Bible. It mentions the word "beginning." The question is then, what beginning is in view? One possibility is that the beginning is referring to the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe. Another possibility is that the beginning is referring to the beginning of the material universe itself.

If the beginning is referring to the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe, then we might translate:

{{% original-translation p="Genesis 1:1" %}}

In beginning [His actions regarding the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth (i.e., created the material universe itself — which was not previously existent).

{{% /original-translation %}}

But if the beginning is referring to the beginning of the material universe, then we might translate:

{{% scripture p="Genesis 1:1" %}}

In the beginning [of the material universe], God created the heavens and the earth.

The Hebrew text of Genesis 1:1 in the Old Testament supports the first possible translation. The Greek text of Genesis 1:1 in the Old Testament also supports the first possible translation. (Since the Old Testament was initially written in Hebrew, this Greek version of the Old Testament was a translation for people who could only read Greek, not Hebrew. It is called the Septuagint, and is sometimes abbreviated as LXX (Roman Numerals), meaning "70", just like the Latin word *septuaginta* from which we get the English name).

The Greek text of John 1:1 in the New Testament supports the first possible translation as well. John 1:1 also mentions a beginning, and is closely parallel with Genesis 1:1. (It is very, very likely that the Apostle John, the author of the gospel of John, did this intentionally to emphasize the eternal divinity that Jesus -- the incarnate Word of God -- possesses).

All of these texts support the first possible translation because they lack something called a definite article. If the definite article were there, the texts would read as "*the* beginning" rather than just "a beginning." Without the definite article it makes decidedly less sense to take the beginning in Genesis 1:1 as the beginning of the material universe.

One might be able to argue that the definite article in Genesis 1:1 is implied and ought to be supplied... except it does not show up in the Septuagint or John 1:1 either, as one might expect if it were in fact supposed to be supplied. Such an argument thus requires you to assume quite a lot. It is not impossible for the definite article to be implied even so (in all three texts), but anyone who argues for such ought to acknowledge that this large leap in logic exists in their position.

We have בְּרֵאשִׁית not בָּרֵאשִׁית in Genesis 1:1. We have Ἐν ἀρχῇ not Ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ in John 1:1. (Genesis 1:1 in the Septuagint also reads Ἐν ἀρχῇ rather than Ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ).

Aside from the textual evidence, taking the beginning in a definite way would seem to imply that space and time were somehow already in existence during God's creation of the heavens and the Earth. This causes theological problems (or at least can) as it muddles God's eternal existence and externality to material creation.

God exists as three persons that share one essence. This doctrine is known as the Trinity. All three members of the Trinity existed before the material universe itself existed. God exists "outside" spacetime. (Sometimes "space and time" are written together as "spacetime," since physicists have shown that the two things are closely related).

When God commanded spacetime to come into existence from nothing, it did. God's existence is in no way linked to the beginning of the material universe. In fact, it is actually right and proper to say that God existed *before* time, because he created time.

We human beings are very small and finite. Due to this limited perspective, we don't have much hope of truly understanding exactly what it means to be outside of space and time. This acknowledgement of our own limits is the first step to accepting the difficult idea of God existing outside of space and time.

The second step is understanding God's identity as I AM. In Exodus 3:14–15 God declares to Moses that His name is "I AM".

#### The divine name of God {#the-divine-name-of-god}

יהוה, the divine name of the God in the Old Testament, is sometimes called the tetragrammaton (from Greek τετραγράμματον, meaning "[consisting of] four letters"). Here's this same Exodus passage in the Hebrew:

{{% ot t="hebrew-i" h="600px" p="Exodus 3:14-15" %}}

{{% scripture-h p="Exodus 3:14-15 | BHS, NASB95" %}}

(BHS) **14** וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה אֶֽהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶֽהְיֶה וַיֹּאמֶר כֹּה תֹאמַר לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶֽהְיֶה שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶֽם׃

(NASB) **14** God said to Moses, “ I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘ I AM has sent me to you.’”

(BHS) **15** וַיֹּאמֶר עוֹד אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה כֹּֽה־תֹאמַר אֶל־בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי אֲבֹתֵיכֶם אֱלֹהֵי אַבְרָהָם אֱלֹהֵי יִצְחָק וֵאלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶם זֶה־שְּׁמִי לְעֹלָם וְזֶה זִכְרִי לְדֹר דֹּֽר׃

(NASB) **15** God, furthermore, said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘ The  Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations.

Liberal scholars squabble endlessly about the etymology of the tetragrammaton, but it is clear from usage that the divine the name of God is fundamentally connected to existence, just as in this passage from Exodus.

I've honestly always found the ink spilled here somewhat regrettable, inasmuch as actual *usage* is always king in lexicography, not etymology. For another example of scholars getting off in the weeds of etymology and muddling themselves theologically, compare all the confusion over the Greek adjective [μονογενής](https://biblehub.com/greek/3439.htm). (Ichthys hits interpretive issues surrounding μονογενής [here](https://ichthys.com/mail-Only-Begotten-Mother-Of-God-On-This-Rock.htm) and [here](https://ichthys.com/mail-Jesus-is-God-and-Man.htm#monogenes--only-begotten), for example).

<!-- --- -->

To be clear, it's not even that the etymology of יהוה has been settled contrary to the semantic scope we have observable to us from usage. For example:

{{% quote src="https://ref.ly/logosres/isbe?ref=VolumePage.V+2%2c+p+506&off=6185" text="ISBE1995" %}}
Scholars now generally agree, however, that the name is connected with the verb *hāwâ*, itself an archaic form of *hāyâ*, “be, become, happen.” What is in doubt, however, is the form of the verb. Some scholars have seen it as simply a combination of the root *hwh* plus prefixed *y* to make a personal name. Much more common is the view that it is the qal (simple) conjugation of the verb, with either a present sense—“He who is,” “the self-existent one”—or an imperfect, future sense—“He who will continue to be (present with His people).” Another common view is that it is the hiphil (causative) conjugation: “He who causes to be, who brings into existence,” i.e., “the Creator.” Although this last explanation is attractive and has had much support, it is doubtful for two reasons. First, there is no known example of *hāyâ* in the hiphil. Second, on the only occasion where an apparent attempt is made to explain the name (Ex. 3:14f), Yahweh’s character and acts as Israel’s redeeming, covenant God, not His role as Creator, are indicated.
{{% /quote %}}

The point is simply that all of this doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Anyone who reads Exodus 3:14-15 with an open mind will get the gist of *what God himself says His name means*. I'll take that over scholarly speculation any day of the week.

If you like, though, read what some scholars have to say on the divine name:

- More liberal scholars: [AYBD > Yahweh](https://ref.ly/logosres/anch?hw=Yahweh)
- More conservative scholars: [ISBE1995 > Volume 2, Page 506](https://ref.ly/logosres/isbe?ref=VolumePage.V+2%2c+p+506&off=6185)

Put simply, existence is tied up in who God is. God is the Alpha and Omega, He who is and was and is to come, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End (Revelation 1:8; 22:13). For this reason, time is of no consequence to God.

### Recap {#recap}

We discussed how Genesis 1:1 (in the original Hebrew and Greek Septuagint both) and John 1:1 do not have direct articles, meaning the texts read "a beginning" not "the beginning." This supports the idea that the beginning referred to is the beginning of God's actions regarding the material universe, not the beginning of the material universe itself. Not translating properly or failing to explain this properly can obscure this fact.

The big issue with not getting this right is that it might give the false impression that God’s creation of the heavens and the Earth proceeded with spacetime already existing. Some people might think based on this that God is merely a very powerful creature that is also bound by space and time in the universe, like we are. But we saw above that God exists outside spacetime. 

The right way to take it is instead that God's creation of the heavens and the Earth *is* the creation of spacetime.

Even though the operative phrase in John 1:1 is often translated "in the beginning", there is no definite article present in the Greek (i.e., no "the"). As such, the Greek phrase en archei is a deliberate parallel of the phrase in Genesis 1:1, bereshith, which, likewise, has no definite article (although of course the English versions never reflect this important fact). The lack of the article in both cases is significant. When English speakers hear, "in the beginning", they assume, not completely without reason, that there was some point of departure for everything (including perhaps God – and that is a grave mistake to make). There was a discrete "beginning" for the world we see, the physical universe of space and time (as well as the heavenly dimensions we cannot presently see), but not for God who "is" and always "was" and always "will be" (irrespective of time or space). God existed before He made the universe, before He created the angels, and before any of the seen or unseen parts of the present cosmos came into being through His creative act. Put another way, God transcends time and space. How this is and what this entails defies description by creatures such as we are who have been made for time/space and exist only in time/space. But that is the way it "is", and that is why the language in Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1 is so careful. One could translate the former "the first thing God did [in respect to the universe we now see] was create the heavens and the earth"; and John 1:1 "before creation, the Word was with God". That, in any case, is what the phrases mean respectively: God existed, God "was" before anything was created by Him.
The above has important implications for understanding "who" God is, and also for understanding the Trinity. To put this as simply as possible, God is spirit (rather than "a spirit"), and His existence as such precedes the cosmos we can see and is completely independent of it. The world only exists because God created it, and only continues to exist because He "holds it together" (that is the meaning of the Greek at Colossians 1:17). God could have created a quadrillion such universes in the blink of an eye, and still certainly can.

Here’s a quote from [Bartek](/links/#writings-from-the-desk-of-TODO) on some of the significance of all this:

{{% scripture src="https://ichthys.com/Bartek/John1-1.pdf" text="Bartek > John 1:1" %}}
The Greek [of John 1:1] says "in beginning" (there is no definite article before "beginning" in Greek) and that is an exact equivalent of the Hebrew בְּרֵאשִׁית (bereshith) in Genesis 1:1 which has the same meaning and to which John here directly refers ("beginning" is anarthrous in Hebrew as well). Genesis 1:1 says that "in beginning God created the heavens and the earth", thus bereshith denoting the state at the point when God began the work of creation (Luginbill, n.d.) – not the beginning of creation itself. The latter view results in a logical error, as according to it at the point when God began to create – which is here described as "in beginning" - creation would already have to have been there, as only then "in beginning" could be taken to mean "beginning of creation", but the very point is that it is at that point that God started His creative work.

By writing en archē John refers to the same point in time as Moses did in Genesis 1:1 – the point when as yet there was nothing. And just as Moses moves forward from that point to tell of God’s first creative act ("In [the] beginning God created the heavens and the earth"), so John describes the state before creation came into being. And before creation came into being, the Word was (John 17:5; cf. Micah 5:2).

## Genesis 1:1 is a statement of historical description not a forward-looking summary {#genesis-1-1-is-a-statement-of-historical-description-not-a-forward-looking-summary}

We’re not yet done handling the misunderstandings surrounding this first verse of the Bible. Partially caused by the common improper inclusion of the definite article in translation, many people take Genesis 1:1 as a forward-looking summary of the seven days described in the following verses rather than as a statement of historical description.^[fn:1]

[fn:1] : Although the improper inclusion of the definite article does not logically necessitate taking Genesis 1:1 as a forward-looking summary (i.e., it is perfectly possible to translate as "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" while simultaneously not taking the verse as a forward-looking summary), it does make such an interpretation somewhat more attractive. It is somewhat a chicken-or-the-egg situation: does this interpretation get put forward because of the improper inclusion of the definite article, or is the definite article improperly included (largely) because of this interpretation?

Taking Genesis 1:1 as a forward-looking summary means understanding things in the following way:

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth (event 1): first this thing happened (event 1.1), and then this thing happened (event 1.2), …

As opposed to viewing verse 1 as a historical event that preceded the things described in following verses:

> In beginning, God created the heavens and the earth (event 1). Then this thing happened (event 2), and then this thing happened (event 3), …

I could make my own technical argument as to why the second view is correct, but Ichthys has some good discussion on this already in [Part 2 of the Satanic Rebellion Series](https://ichthys.com/sr2-copy.htm#I.%20Linguistic%20Evidence%20for%20the%20Genesis%20Gap:):

{{% scripture src="https://ichthys.com/sr2-copy.htm#I.%20Linguistic%20Evidence%20for%20the%20Genesis%20Gap:" text="Ichthys > SR2" %}}
First of all, the opening sentence of the Bible (taken by itself, and examined without any preconceptions) purports to be just what we are suggesting here: an historical description of God's first action vis-à-vis the material universe, namely His original creation of it. On the other hand, problems for the alternative summary-statement theory arise as soon as we move on to verse two. For the earth is there described as being "without form, and void" (KJV). But if verse one is not an actual description of the creation of the heavens and the earth, but rather merely a summary of the whole seven days that follow, then how are we to explain the fact that there is no re-statement of its initial creation in the detailed account? Where did this formless "earth" come from? Are we to suppose that it did somehow exist before original creation? That would be quite a blow for all who genuinely believe in a God who transcends the universe and in His ex nihilo creation of it (see section II below). If, on the other hand, earth really was originally created "from nothing", it seems beyond odd not to mention that creation in the detailed account of the seven days (if indeed we are to assume that they represent original creation), and, on that account, strained to assume that the bald statement of its creation in verse one is a mere summary.
{{% /scripture %}}

Now, this leaves us at the point where we are taking Genesis 1:1 as describing God’s ex nihilo creation of the material universe ("the heavens and the earth") rather than acting as a summary statement for the verses that follow.

# Verse 2 {#verse-2}

The question that follows is thus 




We’ll get to exactly what the so-called "Genesis Gap" is when discussing the second verse just below, but for now note that it is essentially impossible to take verse 1 as a forward-looking summary if one at all cares about what the Hebrew actually says.

I know this seems jarring to many because it means, in essence, that I am saying that anyone who does not come to this conclusion is being unfaithful to the biblical text. Perhaps this starkness would not be so striking were it not for the fact that essentially all translations have it wrong. So am I saying that translators and theologians for hundreds of years have done violence to the grammar of the first and second verses of the Bible? Yes, yes I am.
Consider the fact that the number of people believing one interpretation over the other in this particular case is of almost no consequence because everyone who does not have Hebrew is led to believe the "Genesis 1:1 as forward-looking summary" position by default; English translations leave no other option. On the other hand, imagine if this were the translation generally put before people:

From Ichthys

Before all else, God created the heavens and the earth. But the earth came to be ruined and despoiled – darkness lay upon the face of the abyss while God's Spirit brooded over the surface of its waters.
Genesis 1:1-2




 that I am explicitly calling out almost all contemporary understanding of Genesis 1:1 as being 


This isn’t some indistinct matter of opinion; it’s grammar. The fact that most all English translations "get this wrong" and most people
