In the first several verses of chapter 2, Paul condemns hypocritical judgment. It is in this very context that verse 5 picks up.
 
We should take care then, when thinking about these people addressed in verse 5, to not think ourselves so far removed that stubbornness and an unrepentant attitude can never characterize our own behavior, or that we are somehow qualitatively different and distinct just because we are in fact believers.

In fact, every day we too make decisions wherein we stubbornly cling to our pursuit of worldly things rather than keeping our eyes upon the eternal as we ought. God demands that we put His truth first and let it fill all parts of our lives, not picking and choosing from it in some half-hearted, piecemeal affair. Just like those who go into military service, our job as good Christian soldiers is not something that we get to design ourselves, dictating to our superiors what we will and will not do as part of our duties. No, instead, we receive orders from our Commanding Officer, and only "pull our weight" in the ranks when we execute *all of them* (not just those we fancy) faithfully and completely.

So each of us needs to reflexively examine ourselves to make sure that there are not things in our lives right in the present where we have decided to dictate to God about what actions we will take, or whether we will view something as wrong (in accordance with the truth), instead choosing to willfully blind ourselves to it. For on that Great Day of Days, all will be laid bare before the throne of judgment, and no amount of excuse-making or rationalization will be able to turn away the truth of the verdict passed upon our actions in this life.
