#### There could never be a harlot in the line of Jesus Christ! How heretical!

[**Post hoc note**: if any wording here rubs you the wrong way, you can jump ahead a little bit to the standalone purple post hoc section, where I go through the situations of these women in more depth and specificity than I did during the actual exchange as recorded here].

I must confess that this one always baffles me. Tamar is in the lineage of Christ, and she seduced and had sex with her father in law (Judah) after he failed to supply a third husband for her.

Bathsheba is in the lineage of Christ, and she committed adultery with King David. [**Post hoc note:** it's worth mentioning that this is really probably almost entirely on David rather than her -- since he was the king, she probably did not have much choice. We don't really know what Bathsheba thought about the whole thing. Nonetheless, the point remains that a shadow is cast over her marriage with David on account of this beginning, even if it was not at all her fault. That is, that God appears to have blessed the marriage and Bathsheba in it (and also the son -- Solomon -- coming from it) is still a clear example of His redemptive grace, whatever the specifics].

Ruth is in the lineage of Christ, and she was a Moabitess.

#### There could never be a harlot in the line of Jesus Christ! How heretical!

So the fact that Rahab, a prostitute who likely converted to monotheistic Judaism after her inheritance in Canaan with the Israelites (cf. Joshua 6:25), is in the lineage of Christ does not surprise me at all, nor it should it surprise anyone.

In fact, one might go so far as to say that the onus is on those who want to make Rahab the wife of Salmon out to be some sort of unrealistic virginal figure to give examples of females listed in the line of Christ that didn't receive grace in bounds. Actually, in Matthew 1, the only other women explicitly mentioned are the three above, so to claim that Rahab "has to be" someone other than a prostitute is to create a glaring double standard.

<h4>More on the women in the genealogy of Christ</h4>

<p>After hearing a sermon on these women in the genealogy of Christ that made me horribly nauseous on account of what amounted to women-bashing, I wish to spell out more specifics here to head off any misinterpretation of my words. (Which I now wish I had put somewhat differently; even though I never meant anything even close to women-bashing in what I wrote -- God forbid! -- I'm now more sensitive to the wording on this matter specifically, since it has become apparent to me that spelling it out is probably necessary to stop certain arrogant men from twisting things).</p>

<p>Let me be clear: women are <em>not</em> uniformly spiritually bankrupt, temptresses leading men away from the truth, the sex lacking moral backbone. That some people actually believe this is terrifying. Men and women are co-heirs in the inheritance of Christ, and share in the image of God, per Genesis 1:27. Men and women have quite different roles and duties in this life, to be sure, but women are in no way spiritually inferior.</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>The women are not the only people in the genealogy in need of grace</h4>

<p>Let's not pretend that it's only the women in the genealogy that need grace. Judah doesn't come off looking too good with respect to Tamar. Putting aside the fact his not properly fulfilling his obligations to her was what led to everything to begin with (Genesis 38:14), she may have been complicit inasmuch as she put on an act, but he was in fact the one who propositioned her, thinking her a prostitute (Genesis 38:16).</p>

<p>And as alluded to above with Bathsheba, the whole thing is really primarily David's sin. That Bathsheba is compared metaphorically to an ewe lamb in the prophet Nathan's rebuke of David (2 Samuel 12) is pretty open-and-shut evidence, in my view of things. Lambs are not dark moral influences, right? That's why this story cut David as it did -- because he saw that the very man he burned with anger against (that is, the unreasonable villain of the story leading an innocent creature to slaughter) was himself.</p>

<p>How about Jacob? It is pretty painful to see his treatment of Leah throughout Genesis. And resorting to deceit to get his father's blessing is not exactly positive either. (Although at least he did properly recognize the importance of the blessing).</p>

<p>How about Abraham's treatment of Hagar and Ishmael at the behest of his jealous wife?</p>

<p>One might go on. The point is not to smear dirt upon every single person in the lineage of Christ. The point is, no matter how great of believers these people were -- and who can claim to be on the same level as Abraham and David? -- they too needed grace. It's not just the ladies, is what I'm saying.</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>Pardon my denseness, but how in the world do people find so much fault with these women?</h4>

<p>I won't rehash too much more about Bathsheba, as we've covered her sufficiently above. Let's just say that viewing her as the main problem there is kind of ridiculous, if you think about it for more than a couple seconds.</p>

<p>How about Ruth? To be blunt, how anyone can read the book of Ruth and then think anything negative of Ruth is beyond me. The entire book is a beautiful account of how God redeems all who want to be redeemed. Ruth was willing to give up her home, her culture, her religion -- everything -- to support her mother-in-law in her time of trial. And despite being a cultural outsider, she is forever memorialized as an ancestor of the Savior of the world.</p>

<p>As to Tamar, perhaps she could have come up with a different way to deal with Judah's unjust treatment of her, but you can't help feeling at least a bit sorry for her. It is evident that neither Er nor Onan were exactly prime husband material (given that the Lord physically slew both of them directly in displeasure), and then Judah basically shipped her off because he was worried that his third son would meet the same fate as his immoral brothers... and then blew off his promise thereafter. At the very least, she's not the only or even primary driver of the unfortunate events.</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>Pardon my denseness, but how in the world do people find so much fault with these women?</h4>

<p>And that finally brings us to Rahab, practitioner of that oldest profession. We certainly should not bend over backwards to excuse that which ought not to be excused, but nonetheless, scripture is pretty clear that her actions saved the spies in Joshua 2, at risk to her own life. Her past aside, she chose to align herself with the Lord God of Israel in her actions.</p>

<p>(I should note that while we have no direct evidence one way or the other as to if she changed jobs after the Israelites took over the land, it would make logical sense, especially if she did in fact marry Salmon, who was perhaps one of the spies. We can't assume this to prove our position because that's circular, but I'm just saying that taking things this way "works" logically -- that is, there is no prostitute in the lineage of Christ, but an ex-prostitute redeemed by the grace of God due to her faith).</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>I like wording things in terms of grace more than moral redemption</h4>

<p>So, to turn back to the main point at hand, just like basically everyone else, the ladies too needed grace.</p>

<p>The language of moral redemption is often used of these women. This is perhaps appropriate in at least some sense for Tamar and Rahab, but I think it is better to phrase things positively in terms of God's grace, for that is consistent across all four women.</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>I like wording things in terms of grace more than moral redemption</h4>

<p>Even though Bathsheba's marriage with the King of Israel came about under the most unfortunate of circumstances, God still appears to have blessed her marriage and son even so. God's grace is evident in blessing a marriage based on the foundation of adultery, counter to expectations.</p>

<p>Ruth was not an Israelite by birth and culture, but an outsider. God's grace is evident in that she was not only allowed to inherit the covenants of Israel by marriage, but even came to be the mother of the bloodline containing both David and Christ. An outsider became a matriarch of Israel, counter to expectations.</p>

<p>Since the bloodline of the Savior came through Tamar's son Perez, one of the twins born of Judah, Tamar too is in the lineage of Christ. Despite being sent away unwanted and treated unjustly, her vindication comes in her sons. God's grace is evident in that the bloodline of Christ leads back to a woman cast aside rather than a treasured wife, counter to expectations.</p>

<p>Finally, God delivered the spies of Israel by a prostitute rather than a noble woman of virtue. Of all the people in the land, only a prostitute feared the Lord and acted to save her family. Perhaps most shocking of all our women, Rahab represents the grace of God in full effect. This is not the outward plastering over of dirtiness within -- lipstick on a pig -- but a complete rebirth from the inside out, a woman turning from death to life. God's grace is more than evident in these events -- it practically screams from every word. Even though such shatters expectations.</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>It is telling that some people strongly resist the idea that a prostitute could end up in the line of Christ, while at the same time not registering nearly as much outrage over a well-known persecutor of early Christians becoming an Apostle. Ever heard of Paul? Oh that's right, he was a man.</p>

<p>Ever since Adam and Eve, (some) men have tried to blame it all on the women, as if that were some sort of excuse. It wasn't a valid excuse then (Adam's words of blame are no credit to him in Genesis 3), and it won't fly with God now either.</p>

<p>Even though the genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 trace bloodlines through the males, these women were included in Matthew's genealogy for a reason, and that is to showcase the surpassing grace of God. Other women could have been included -- the righteous wives of various men throughout the generations -- but that's not what God chose to emphasize. Instead, it is the women that would be the subject of gossip and slander -- the one who had twins by her older father-in-law, the one whose husband the king murdered to obtain, the one coming from a foreign land, the one who used to be a prostitute -- these are the women God saw fit to have Matthew mention.</p>

<p>Not because women are bad or immoral or always in need of redemption away from their base natures, but because the situations of these four women display God's manifold grace in a powerful way. God did not somehow change His policy of grace and mercy towards mankind with the sending of His Son, but instead, the sending of His Son was simply another step in this same pattern that has always been the case.</p>

</div>

<div class="special-content post-hoc-note">


<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>To tie everything together into a nice neat bow, if communicating the above was in fact God's purpose in having the women mentioned in Matthew's genealogy (and there is little other logical explanation for their inclusion), then it actually makes quite a bit more sense for the Rahab mentioned in the genealogy to be the prostitute mentioned in Joshua. Otherwise why would this woman be mentioned by name alongside all the other "trophies of grace" (Bathsheba, Ruth, Tamar)?</p>

<p>So, far from us having theological problems if we take the Rahab in the genealogy to be the prostitute, the context almost demands it.</p>

<p>If I were to make an argument about all this from scratch, I would hit this point very hard: that the other women in the lineage of Christ are all mentioned specifically to demonstrate God's great love and grace, so it makes little sense for the Rahab mentioned here to be some random woman we know nothing else about rather than the reformed prostitute bearing that name.</p>
