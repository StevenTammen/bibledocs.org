#### Our objective as Christians: grow closer to God while walking with Him through this life

Our objective as believers in Jesus Christ is to walk through this world with Him in an acceptable way, drawing closer to Him in our Christian walk day by day so as to grow, progress and produce. Closeness to God the Father and to our dear Lord Jesus Christ in our brief sojourn here in this world is an important aspect of our Christian walk.

> Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts!  
> Psalm 65:4a, NIV

> But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.  
> Psalm 73:28, NKJV

> The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.  
> Psalm 145:18, NKJV

> "For who is the one who has devoted his heart to come close to Me?", says the Lord.  
> Jeremiah 30:21b, translation from Ichthys

#### Our objective as Christians: grow closer to God while walking with Him through this life

> "Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him."  
> John 14:23, NKJV

> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  
> Hebrews 7:19, KJV

> Come closer to God, and He will come closer to you.  
> James 4:8 (cf. Is.55:6-7; Zech.1:3; Mal.3:7), translation from Ichthys

#### Closeness to God means turning our back on the world

Closeness to God means turning our back on the world (Jas.4:4; 1Jn.2:15-17), and the desires of the flesh (Rom.6:6; 7:5-6; Eph.4:22; Col.3:9; 1Pet.4:3), and results in greater joy of fellowship with Him we as progress through the truth on our spiritual journey (1Cor.1:9; 1Pet.1:8; 1Jn.1:3-4).

Nearness to the Lord and close fellowship with Him is the result of walking our Christian walk in a way that pleases Him. That has always been the case:

> We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.  
> Hebrews 6:12, NKJV

> Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.  
> Hebrews 13:7, NKJV

> Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.  
> James 5:10, NKJV

> Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good.  
> 3rd John 1:11, NKJV

#### On the idea of imitating role models

As these verses remind us, good role models to imitate go a long way towards showing us how to walk in this world.

When we imitate someone truly worthy of imitation, it has a tendency to cut through all doctrinal and theological complications and demonstrate for us "the entire package" so as to be able to "go and do likewise" immediately.

For that reason, there are worse things a believer could do than to set him/herself to emulating the lives of the great believers of the Bible (their spiritually positive qualities, that is). Such can be a valuable way of encouraging ourselves and empowering our Christian walk, shining a bright light upon our defects and reinforcing the good we are doing.

> (32) Now what shall I say more? For time would fail me, were I to go on and relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Sampson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, (33) who through their faith defeated kingdoms, accomplished acts of righteousness, received the fulfillment of promises, shut the mouths of lions, (34) quenched the power of fire, fled the mouth of the sword, were made strong in weakness, were made powerful in war, defeated enemy armies -- (35) women even received back their dead. (36) Some [of these great believers of the past] were tortured, refusing release, that they might obtain a better resurrection (i.e., worth more to them than their lives; cf. Ps.63:3. Others endured ridicule and beatings, and even chains and imprisonment. (37) They were stoned, sawed in half, killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goat hides. They were deprived, persecuted, abused. (38) The world was not worthy of them. They wandered the deserts and the mountains, making their homes in caves and fissures in the earth. (39) And through their faith, all of them though they became witnesses [to the world] (lit., "were martyred"), yet they did not receive the promise (i.e., resurrection and reward), (40) since God was looking forward for our sakes to something better, so that they might not be made perfect (i.e., resurrected and rewarded) without us.  
> Hebrews 11:32-40, translation from Ichthys

#### This list is not comprehensive

In the spirit of this passage, the list of believers we will go over is offered only by way of example, lest "time should fail us". Investigating the life of David would require a book; considering the example of our Lord, an encyclopedia -- for He is the ultimate example to us all.

It is hoped that as the principles taught throughout this study are learned and digested through faith, the strengths and positive qualities of all the greats of scripture will be seen ever more clearly as the Bible is read daily, and that the positive attributes of these believers, demonstrated in the effectiveness and rich texture of their individual walks with the Lord, will be more easily and more joyously adapted to our own. For there is much to emulate even in a very brief perusal of some of the more outstanding believers of the Bible.

---


#### Enoch

> Enoch made a practice of walking [diligently] with God -- then he was no more, because God took him [to Himself].  
> Genesis 5:24, translation from Ichthys

> By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, "and was not found, because God had taken him"; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  
> Hebrews 11:5, translation from Ichthys

We know very little about Enoch, but we know all we need to know.

Both in the genealogy of the line of faith in Genesis and in the catalog of great believers in Hebrews he is included for his consistency of spiritual growth, walking with God closely, diligently and persistently, so much so that he is recorded by the Spirit as having "pleased God", and was rewarded with an early release from the troubles of this world in a unique manner (i.e., transmutation rather than conventional physical death).

Enoch is in for a great eternal reward, no doubt. Let us emulate his efforts in making our walk with the Lord more constant and closer each day.

---


#### Noah

> These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations. Noah, moreover, made a habit of walking with God.  
> Genesis 6:9, translation from Ichthys

> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.  
> Genesis 6:22, NIV

> The Lord then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation."  
> Genesis 7:1, NIV

> And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.  
> Genesis 7:5, NIV

Noah's walk with God is described in Hebrews in the very same terms as was that of Enoch. 

Moreover, Noah was called upon by the Lord to do things no one had ever done before -- and he did them, ***all*** of them, consistently, and in precisely the way in which the Lord commanded him to do them. Nor does scripture give us any indication that he was hesitant or complained in any way.

That would be a marvel of obedience and spiritual consistency at any time, but in the midst of a generation so perverse that "all flesh" outside of Noah and his family had "corrupted their way" (Gen.6:12), Noah's example is truly amazing.

---


#### Noah

Difficult times are coming for us too. A flood of sorts, and a worldwide one too. And we too are called upon to build an ark to survive that coming flood, not a literal wooden boat, but a vessel of truth in our hearts capable of staying afloat no matter what storms and swells the riptides of tribulation bear us into.

Like Noah, let us be consistent in our obedient preparation that we may not only survive that flood but spiritually thrive in its midst, offering the refuge of truth to all who come to our light (cf. Ezek.14:14; 14:20; 1Pet.3:20-21).

> By faith, Noah, when divinely informed about things which were not yet visible, in reverent piety constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, through which [same] faith [by responding to God] he condemned the world and became heir to the righteousness which is [awarded] according to faith.  
> Hebrews 11:7, translation from Ichthys

---


#### Abraham

> (8) By faith, Abraham, when He was called [by God], obeyed and went forth into the place he was destined to receive as an inheritance. He went forth, moreover, in ignorance of where [exactly] he was heading. (9) By faith, he sojourned as an alien in the land he had been promised, dwelling in tents with Jacob and Isaac, coheirs of [this same] promise. (10) For he was waiting for the foundation of that city (i.e., the New Jerusalem) whose architect and builder is God.  
> Hebrews 11:8-10, translation from Ichthys

> (17) By faith Abraham offered up Isaac when he was tested, and was on the point of offering up [in sacrifice] his one and only son, the one who [about whom he] had received the promises, (18) about whom it had been said, "In Isaac shall your seed be called", (19) [for Abraham was] reckoning that God was able to raise [him] from the dead, whence (i.e., from the dead) he did receive [Isaac] back even metaphorically (i.e., Isaac was as good as dead but God delivered him through the substitute of the ram, a type of Jesus Christ).  
> Hebrews 11:17-19, translation from Ichthys

In many important ways, Abraham is ***the*** example for believers. He obeyed the Lord, even when it was hard, even when he had no clear idea of where he was going (the land of promise) or what he was doing or why (sacrificing Isaac).

He was not perfect, but he always recovered from his mistakes, and demonstrated his true, solid and deep faith in the Lord by his patience, waiting until he was a hundred years old for the birth of the heir he so longed for. And without hesitation and in complete faith in the Lord in spite of the rending of his heart, he was willing to offer that heir up as a sacrifice -- because he ***trusted*** the Lord no matter what.

---


#### Abraham

Therefore when it comes to faith, Abraham "is the father of us all" (Rom.4:16), and the perfect model of resilient, consistent, obedient faith that trusts in the Lord and in His promises regardless of what the eyes may see or the ears hear or the emotions feel.

Let us resolve to follow in his footsteps of dynamic faith whatever this life brings, because, like Abraham, we too are "waiting for the foundation of that city whose architect and builder is God" (Heb.11:10).
