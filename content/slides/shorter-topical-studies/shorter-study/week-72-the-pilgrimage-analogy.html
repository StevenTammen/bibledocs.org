#### Introduction to the pilgrimage analogy

> "I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not ***walk*** in darkness, but will have the light of life."  
> John 8:12b

The Christian life is often compared to a journey, walking with Jesus Christ day by day and following Him to the end. The prevalence of this analogy in scripture is the reason for the title of this study, "Peripateology", the study of the Christian walk, with the coinage being based upon the most common word for walking in the New Testament, *peripateo* (cf. English "peripatetic"). And while this Greek word can and often does refer to literal walking, more often than not it is used in the Bible in a metaphorical way to describe our behavior in this world. Sometimes this relates to unbelievers or lapsed believers (Mk.7:5; Jn.6:66; Eph.2:2; Col.3:7), but usually it is employed to guide Christians in the way in which we ought to be walking in this world (cf. 2Cor.10:2-3; 12:18):

---


#### Ways in which should walk

We should walk in the light and not in the dark so as not to stumble (Jn.11:9-10).

We should walk in the light while we still can before the darkness comes (Jn.12:35).

We should walk in newness of life (Rom.6:4).

We should walk according to the Spirit and not according to the flesh (Rom.8:1-4).

We should walk in a seemly way as in the day, and not in revelry, drunkenness, lewdness, lust, strife and envy (Rom.13:13).

---


#### Ways in which should walk

We should walk in love so as not to grieve our brothers and sisters in Christ (Rom.14:15).

We should walk as spiritual (following the Spirit) and not as carnal (following the sin nature) in envy and strife (1Cor.3:3).

We should walk being satisfied with the gifts, provision and circumstances the Lord has given us (1Cor.7:17).

We should walk in the Spirit, by means of the Spirit (Gal.5:16).

We should walk in the accomplishment of the good works that the Lord has prepared for us to do (Eph.2:10).

---


#### Ways in which should walk

We should walk worthily of our calling in Jesus Christ (Eph.4:1).

We should not walk as unbelievers do in futility of mind, darkened understanding, alienation from God, ignorance of the truth, hardness of heart, insensitivity to the Spirit, being abandoned to lewdness, uncleanness, greediness (Eph.4:17).

We should walk in love (Eph.5:2).

We should walk as children of the light (Eph.5:8).

We should take care how we walk, not as fools but as those who are wise (Eph.5:15).

---


#### Ways in which should walk

We should walk as the godly walk, not like the ungodly (Phil.3:17-18; cf. Ps.1:1).

We should walk worthy of the Lord pleasing Him, with good works, increasing knowledge of God, strengthened in all His might, and in all patience, longsuffering and joy, ever giving thanks (Col.1:10-12).

We should continue walking now just as we received Jesus as our Savior, rooted and built up in Him, established in faith with thanksgiving. (Col.2:6-7).

We should walk in wisdom towards those who do not believe (Col.4:5).

We should walk worthily of God (1Thes.2:12).

---


#### Ways in which should walk

We should walk as we have been taught to in order to please God (1Thes.4:1).

We should walk in a decent manner towards those who are not believers (1Thes.4:12).

We should avoid those who walk in a disorderly way (2Thes.3:6; cf. 2Thes.3:11).

We should walk in the light (1Jn.1:7, not in the darkness (1Jn.1:6; 2:11).

We should walk as Jesus walked (1Jn.2:6).

We should walk in the truth (2Jn.1:4-6; 3Jn.1:4-5).

---


#### We ought to walk a worthy walk, not forgetting our purpose

In other words, we believers in Jesus Christ are not to be walking about aimlessly; rather we are to be ever walking with Jesus Christ through this dark world, progressing along a definite track in a specific direction for a certain purpose: to cross the finish line of this life and enter into the presence of the Lord, pleasing Him with our walk here and now and reaping the corresponding rewards when we finally see Him face to face. And ***how*** we walk in this world before that time makes all the difference.

> (9) For this reason we also from the [very] day we heard [of your love] do not cease praying on your behalf and asking that you be fulfilled in regard to the full acceptance of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, (10) that you might ***walk worthy*** of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by means of the full knowledge of God.  
> Colossians 1:9-10

---


#### Sometimes we may need to fight our way back onto the high road of Zion

Times may be hard. But we keep moving. There may opposition. But we keep moving. All manner of things may happen which seem to conspire against us so as to knock us off the high road to Zion, but we persevere, fighting our way back onto the road, a narrow one which leads upward in only one, positive direction, and making it our dearest desire to walk worthily of our Lord on this journey as the passage above exhorts us to do.

---


#### Psalm 84 and the pilgrimage analogy

> (5) Happy is everyone whose strength is in You. Their hearts are set on the highways [of pilgrimage to Zion]. (6) As they pass through the [dry] valley of Bachah (lit., "weeping"; i.e., the wilderness of life), they make it a place of springs. Even the early rains enwrap it with [their] blessings. (7) They go from strength to strength, until they appear before God in Zion.  
> Psalm 84:5-7 NIV (cf. Is.35:8-10; Is.55:11; Jer.31:12; 31:6; 50:5)

In this pilgrimage of ours, wonderfully symbolized by the passage above, we are treading a narrow road (Matt.7:13-14; cf. Lk.13:24), taking pains not to turn to the left (after pleasures and personal interests) or the right (out of fear or worry) but to head straight to Zion so as to please our Lord.

---


#### We are following the Spirit's guidance

We are following the Spirit's guidance (Gal.5:16), listening to His "still, small voice" (1Ki.19:12), so as to keep close to the dear Shepherd who is guiding us, the One who is leading us to good pasture (provision for physical needs on the journey), to clear, cool water (provision for spiritual needs on the journey), leading us ever on the right and righteous way, and keeping us safe even from darkness of death by ever-present protection (Ps.23:1-4).

---


#### We are walking through the desert, towards the lands of promise

We are walking through the desert of this world to the land of promise that awaits us, confident that our feet will not swell nor our shoes or clothing wear out, confident that our every need will be met until we cross Jordan's river into the glory that awaits (Deut.8:4; Neh.9:21).

We move forward day by day, one day at a time, carrying our crosses toward our final day in emulation of the Lord who bought us (Matt.10:38; 16:24-26; Mk.8:34; Lk.9:23; 14:27), and merely sojourning in this world in the meantime, being strangers to it just as all our spiritual fathers were (1Chron.29:15; Ps.39:12; 1Pet.1:1-2; 1:17; 2:11), looking forward to the promised goal of the calling to which we have been called, and not to the temporary lust, dust and rust of this wicked world -- and never looking back (Lk.17:32).

---


#### We are walking through the desert, towards the lands of promise

> (13) These all died [while still walking] in faith, though they had not received the [fulfillment of their] promises. But [while they lived] they did catch sight of [these promises] from a distance and salute them, [so to speak], thus making it plain [to all the world] that they were [in effect] strangers and sojourners on the earth. (14) For people who express [their faith] in this way make it quite evident that they are eagerly in search of a homeland [other than the place they now occupy]. (15) Indeed, if these [believers'] hearts had yearned for the [land] from which they had departed, they would have had [ample] opportunity to turn back. (16) But they were zealous for a better place, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. He has, in fact, prepared a city for them (i.e., the New Jerusalem).  
> Hebrews 11:13-16
