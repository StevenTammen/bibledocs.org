### Summary

This cycle was very research-heavy. I worked more on the studies I'm in the process of drafting, and in the process of researching a related topic, kicked off a massive forum discussion, and an email chain with my mentor. I also researched options for local fellowships, and narrowed down the options to several that look promising.

### Worked more on in-progress studies

The same ones mentioned last cycle, about how Christians ought to view judging, and issues in the modern church.

I just don't want to release anything before I feel like things are ready. I've written more now, and split things into several parts, but still don't want to release the earlier parts until I'm sure I know the full order of the topics in the studies and won't change anything around any more.

### Researched a couple topics and had long conversations about them

This was probably the biggest time sink this cycle. We had a very active topic on the forum. Across the four people participating, this topic spanned ~85 posts and ~130 pages single-spaced (were you to print it out).

I emailed my mentor about some of the things being discussed as well, and that email chain got up to ~13 responses long too.

### Researched and decided where I want to start getting involved locally

I made a spreadsheet of many local churches (tens of them), came up with some criteria, and narrowed it down to several options.

I'm hoping to start getting involved in the next week or two.

---


### Upcoming work

- Continuing to work on the studies I mentioned.
- Getting involved in local fellowships.
