## Second Baptist - 2023 Romans Study - Romans 9



### Verses 1-13

#### Why was Paul so insistent that he wasn't lying?

#### Why did Paul have great sorrow?

#### Do you have a burden for the lost? Which ones?

#### Why is the plight of the Jewish nation so sad?

#### What is more likely to fail, the word of God or the word of men?

#### Does God behave as we expect, or the way we would have Him (if it were up to us)?

### Verses 14-26

#### Do we ever earn the right to judge God?

#### Have we ever screamed to God "That isn't fair!"? Based on what?

#### Do we serve a God of injustice or confusion?

#### Do you know your place? Do you retaliate against God when things don't go the way you think they should?

#### Would we rather have God's mercy, or His wrath? What does His mercy provide for a dead person?

### Verses 27-33

#### What happens when God gets sick of putting up with our sinful nature?

#### In most cases, whose fault is it when we suffer?

#### What are some of your stumbling blocks?

#### Why would God put a stumbling block in our path, and does that negate our responsibility for our sin?

#### What is your reward for loyalty to God?
