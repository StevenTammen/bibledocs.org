## All Members of the Trinity Are Distinct Persons



(Derived from https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm)

---


### Summary

This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is only one person (merely displaying three modes or aspects of Himself).
---


#### Outline

- [Key point: God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is only one person (merely displaying three modes or aspects of Himself)](#3)
  - [The Father is a unique person in His own right (for He is distinct from the Son)](#4)
  - [The Son is a unique person in His own right (for He is distinct from the Father)](#5)
  - [The Holy Spirit is a unique person in His own right (for He acts as a distinct person)](#6)

### Key point: God is *one* in essence, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is only one person (merely displaying three modes or aspects of Himself)

God is three in person, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are distinct persons rather than manifestations of a single, multifaceted person.

Heresies of the past which have challenged the distinct personalities of members of the Trinity include modalism (the idea that Christ and the Spirit are mere "modes" of the Father's personality), and docetism (the notion that Christ only seemed real and was in reality merely a phantom of sorts representing the Father's plan). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity are distinct persons.

---


#### The Father is a unique person in His own right (for He is distinct from the Son)

<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>Daniel 7:13</strong>
<p>I was looking during my vision of that night, and behold – with the clouds of heaven one like a Son of Man was coming up, and He approached the Ancient of Days [i.e, the Father] and they brought Him before Him.</p>
</div>


---


#### The Son is a unique person in His own right (for He is distinct from the Father)

<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>Hebrews 10:7</strong>
<p>Behold, I have arrived – in the scroll of Your book it is written about Me – to do Your will, O My God.    </p>
</div>


(See Psalm 40:7-8)

---


#### The Holy Spirit is a unique person in His own right (for He acts as a distinct person)

<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>Romans 8:26</strong>
<p>And the Spirit helps us in our weakness in a similar way. For we do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us also with anguished supplications which words cannot express.  </p>
</div>
