## Introduction - The Essence of God



(Derived from https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm)

---


### Summary

In this lesson, we are going to be kicking off our new study of BB1: Theology on Ichthys by starting to discuss the Essence of God. We'll talk about how God is being (Exodus 3:14-15), as well as exactly what essence means as a concept.

### The essence of God is being. He is the Great I AM



The essence of something is what it really is. "Essence" and "being" are precise synonyms.

God tells us who He is in Exodus 3:14-15.

If you've ever thought about the question "Well, if the universe exists because God made it, then why does God exist? Did something or someone likewise make God?" then the answer is no---God exists simply because God *is* being.

Unbelievers scoff at that logic, but it is what the Bible says.

### The resplendence of God: light and glory



Loosely speaking, light captures the sense that God is sublime and unapproachable (compare squinting at the sun, being blinded by it), while glory represents the side that shines forth visibly to mankind.

God's glory is most directly revealed to mankind through His Son, Jesus Christ. As Hebrews 1:1-3 makes clear.

#### Q: 1 Timothy 6:16 talks about God's unapproachable light. It also says God alone possess immortality. What does that latter statement mean?

When 1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God possess immortality, what about the fact that both humans and angels have eternal existence?

Is it that God *owns* immortality, but that he gives it to us creatures such that we too now possess it (some to eternal life, and some to eternal death, based upon that which we choose)? Is this another aspect of God's Uniqueness?

#### Q: We say God dwells in this unapproachable light that no one has seen nor ever can see. What then of cases in scripture where people seem to have "seen God?"

Did Moses not see this light upon Mount Sinai? What about the Apostles present on the mount of transfiguration? What about Paul on the road to Damascus? What about John in His visions of God, recorded in Revelation?

#### Comment: God's glory as it relates to "every knee will bow, and every tongue confess"

The visible form of this glory was veiled in Christ's first advent to make the choice for Him genuine. The glory was, however, revealed in His words and works.

Compare: "Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess." That is not now, but eventually.

### Essence, nature, character... ???



If you've ever been confused about what the difference between nature and essence is (and we may as well throw form and substance in the mix as well), you are in good company. Philosophers have been arguing about these things for a very long time (compare Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and others).

Arguments usually seem to hinge on how "inherent" something is to an object. For example, a triangle must have three sides, otherwise it is no longer a triangle. Things that are "essential" (compare the word essence!) are things without which the object is not whatever we are saying it is.

### Essence, nature, character... ???

So, on our topic, must God be infinite and perfect in character to be God? Are these essential characteristics of God?

It is my opinion that wandering too far in this direction rapidly leads one to theosophy (in the negative sense). God *is* infinite and perfect in character. So what were we arguing about again?

If someone were to whine that I am question-dodging and not defining terms, I would say that God's nature deals with His infinite abilities, God's character deals with His moral perfection, and both are fundamental parts of who He is as God.
