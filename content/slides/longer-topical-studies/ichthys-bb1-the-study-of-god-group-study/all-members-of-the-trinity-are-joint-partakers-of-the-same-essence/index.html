## All Members of the Trinity Are Joint Partakers of the Same Essence



(Derived from https://ichthys.com/1Theo.htm)

---


### Summary

This lesson's main focus is examining the point that God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is composed of three (or more) different "gods".

### Key point: God is *three* in person, but that does *not* mean that the Trinity is composed of three (or more) different "gods"



God is *one* in essence, and all three members of the Trinity (the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit) are the sole, joint partakers of that same essence rather than three similar beings of similar essence. All so-called Christian sects which elevate saints and angels to the status of divinity essentially belong to this heretical category (after the manner of pagan pantheons, which also possess numerous "deities" of lesser and greater rank). But the Bible teaches that all three members of the Trinity alone share the same unique essence:

#### The Father is revealed to be uniquely God



<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>Deuteronomy 4:35</strong>
<p>You were shown these things so as to know that the Lord, He is God, and there is no other besides Him.</p>
</div>


---


#### The Son and the Father are revealed to be uniquely God



<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>John 10:30</strong>
<p>I and the Father are one.</p>
</div>


Some things I'll add here in addition to this one verse Dr. Luginbill quoted, to emphasize even more that the Son is One with the Father and the Spirit, being God:

- Colossians 2:9
- Philippians 2:6

##### Regarding the notion of us being "small G gods", what words are used for such in the Greek and Hebrew?

#### The Holy Spirit and the Son and the Father are revealed to be uniquely God



<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>John 14:16-17</strong>
<p>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another comforter to be with you forever â€“ the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, for it neither sees Him, nor knows Him. But you know Him, for He abides with you, and will be in you.</p>
</div>


Some things I'll add here in addition to this one verse Dr. Luginbill quoted, to emphasize even more that the Holy Spirit is One with the Father and the Son, being God:

- 2 Peter 1:21
- Acts 5:3-4
- Matthew 28:19 -- "name" here is singular, not plural. And it is also not repeated for the Son and the Spirit; i.e., there is one name and it equally applies to all three.
