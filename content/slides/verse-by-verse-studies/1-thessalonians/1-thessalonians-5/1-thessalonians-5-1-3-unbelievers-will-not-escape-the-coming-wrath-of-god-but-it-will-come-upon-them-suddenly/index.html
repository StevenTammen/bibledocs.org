## 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3 - Unbelievers will not escape the coming Wrath of God, but it will come upon them suddenly



---


### Summary

So sudden will be the coming of the Son of Man that it will catch those who do not see fit to watch for Him completely off guard. They will be utterly destroyed---they will not be able to resist, no one will help them, and they will not get up after being felled. Their doom has been foretold, and it will surely come to pass.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3 - Unbelievers will not escape the coming Wrath of God, but it will come upon them suddenly

1 Thessalonians 5:1-3 is not the only place in scripture where we hear about the sudden destruction of those who refuse to follow God (and therefore the path of true righteousness). For example:

- Proverbs 6:12-15
- Proverbs 24:21-22
- Proverbs 29:1

There are also other passages of formal prophecy (rather than just general principles) dealing with destruction:

- Isaiah 47
- Lamentations 4

## 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3 - Unbelievers will not escape the coming Wrath of God, but it will come upon them suddenly

Isaiah 47 deals with the destruction of so-called "Mystery Babylon", a powerful nation in Revelation drunk on its own prosperity. (Cf. also Revelation 17). It will be utterly destroyed in judgement, even though people will think it too big to fall.

But here in 1 Thessalonians 5, we are talking about the "Day of the Lord", the day of righteous Judgement, and the vindication of God's people. As I say, I line up this passage in 1 Thessalonians with Christ's return immediately preceding Armageddon in Revelation 19:11ff. Hence the focus on destruction here.

Unlike in pop culture portrayals of Armageddon, it will not be a clashing of two armies, or even a battle at all. No, indeed, Revelation 19:21 makes it clear that this is a one-sided slaughter: Jesus Christ utterly destroys all those arrayed against Him. They will be cast down in a moment, unable to resist in the slightest against the Son of God returning in glory. Jesus will not be coming as the Suffering Servant this time (cf. Isaiah 53). Quite to the contrary---this time He is coming with the Crown. The long-prophesied coming of Israel's Savior will come upon the world, and then Christ will establish His perfect rule from Jerusalem.

We might also compare Matthew chapters 24 and 25---the so-called "Olivet Discourse"---which is also prophecy concerning these same events. Jesus will come "as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west" (Matthew 24:27). In fact, the entire point of Matthew 24:36ff. is to exhort us to be attentive and watchful, so sudden will the Son of Man appear. Just like the flood came and utterly destroyed the wicked---without the slightest possibility of escape or even resistance of any sort---so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. And in this way, His return will catch off guard all those who do not see fit to keep watch for Him.
