## 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 - The resurrection of the dead and the rapture at the second coming of Christ



---


### Summary

1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 speaks of the resurrection of the dead at the second coming of Christ, and also the "catching up" of those believers still alive at the time, which is commonly called "the rapture". All this happens when Christ returns right before Armageddon (as described in Revelation 19:11ff.), *not* before the Tribulation. Believing in the false doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture inherently makes one spiritually complacent, so getting this right is important.

### On the concept of "the rapture"

These verses say:

- Those who have died will be resurrected, just as Christ was resurrected
- When Christ returns, first believers who have died will be resurrected at the peal of the trumpet, and then believers still alive at His coming will be "caught up" (compare the Latin verb *rapio*---which is where the term "rapture" comes from) to meet Jesus in the air.

Different theologians hold different views on exactly when this event happens, relative to the events of Revelation collectively known as "the Tribulation". Some believe it happens before the Tribulation (so-called "pre-tribulation rapture"), and that believers will not be in the world when the judgments of Revelation are rendered upon the world. But I believe that the Bible clearly supports the view that it happens after the Tribulation (so-called "post-tribulation rapture"), right before the battle of Armageddon, when Christ returns in glory.

### The doctrine of the post-tribulation rapture

To be clear, this post-tribulation rapture does *not* mean believers will themselves face the full judgments described in Revelation. Just how the generation of the Exodus <sup id="fnref-typological-parallel"><a href="#fn-typological-parallel">1</a></sup> was basically spared from the judgments rendered upon Egypt, believers in the Tribulation will also be basically spared the judgments rendered upon the world around them. But also just how the Exodus generation had to go "through" not "around" (so to speak), so too in this case.

There is only one *parousia* (Greek: [παρουσία](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3952/esv/mgnt/0-1/)) of Christ discussed in scripture---a clear and obvious challenge to the notion that Christ comes as described here in 1 Thessalonians 4, only to disappear for a while (?) until coming again right before Armageddon, as described in Revelation 19:11ff.

Further, while we might say that the falseness of this position in an epistemological sense is established only based on arguments from scripture (i.e., rather than based on utilitarian/consequentialist arguments), we might also note that this false teaching inherently leads to a large amount of spiritual complacency, no matter how much supporters of the position might protest and claim that this is not necessarily the case. (Most do). To put it bluntly, if God will just miraculously spare us from all hardship, why bother preparing spiritually for those difficult times ahead? Even if you know you ought to... well, knowing right and doing right are two very different things, are they not?

### The complacency bred by belief in the false doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture

If you have ever heard something along the lines of "a conflict of interest doesn't go away just because you acknowledge it", same concept applies here. I don't trust a government regulator who owns company stock in the industry they are supposed to be regulating (no matter how much they might swear that it doesn't affect their actions... yeah right), and in the same way, I do not for a moment believe that teaching on this doctrine is independent from people's spiritual motivation (or rather lack thereof). The two things are *not* independent from another, if one looks at the situation with honesty.

And this is why this doctrine is no small matter. Along with belief in the false doctrine of "institutional security" (something along the lines of "I'm saved because I attend church, regardless of my unbelief and poor conduct") and the false doctrine of "positional security" (something along the lines of "I'm saved because I once put my faith in Jesus Christ, and thus cannot stop being saved, regardless of my present unbelief and poor conduct"), belief in the false doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture affects people's spiritual attitude and spiritual motivation very negatively, and therefore stunts their growth, leaving them lukewarm and vulnerable. (You might also read [this page on Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/Pet27.htm), for more on these three dangerous false doctrines).

Once you understand that God measures us not by church attendance but by how much we really commit to Him in our *whole* lives, that while God will never turn His back on us, we are quite capable of turning our back on Him if we stop believing, and that Christians will not be spared the time of judgment upon the world (that will necessarily take an immense amount of faith to navigate properly)---well, suddenly, being a mediocre Christian who just sits on one's hands doesn't work as an option anymore now, does it? God will not be mocked. If you give Him a measly 10% of your life and your focus (no matter how a good a game you talk, if that is actually what the reality is, in fact), well that lack of dedication will do you no credit on Judgement Day. You may be saved, but you will be getting no "well done good and faithful servant!" unless you knock off the complacency and start getting serious about Bible reading, Bible study, prayer, and ministry. So that you might learn the truth, believe it, apply it your life, and then help others do likewise. It is no exaggeration to say that this progression is the very reason we are here in this life.

### Back to the passage

In any case, we are supposed to draw encouragement from the fact that we will see our (believing) loved ones again when Jesus returns, and that we will thereafter be with them in the presence of the Lord forevermore. This is the blessed hope we have to look forward to.
