## Romans 1:27 - What exactly does "receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error" mean?



---


### Summary

The text in Romans 1:27 ("receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error") is sort of ambiguous as to what the error in view is, as well as what the penalty (or negative result/consequence) for said error is. As I see things, things make the most sense if you view this clause as being inclusive and broad in its application rather than exclusive and specific.

### The interpretive challenge: identifying the specific referents for the error and the penalty

There are two fundamental questions when it comes to interpreting the latter part of verse 27:

1) What is the error in view?
2) What is the penalty in view?

Most translations leave things a bit ambiguous here in verse 27: [see here](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm) for a comparison of translations of this verse across Bible versions. This is a actually a good thing, since the Greek itself is ambiguous.

<p>The latter part of verse 27 is a participial phrase modifying the subject of the sentence, οἱ ἄρσενες. This verse actually has several different participles, such that a very literal translation would be:</p>

<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>Romans 1:27 | <a href="/site/content-features/#original-translations">Original translation</a></strong>
<p>And in the same way, the men also, having abandoned [aorist active participle] the natural use of women, were inflamed [aorist passive indicative] in their desire for other men, with the men committing [present middle participle] indecent acts, and receiving [present active participle] in themselves the penalty which was was proper [imperfect impersonal, from δεῖ] for their error.</p>
</div>


<p>In any case, the last part of the sentence (τὴν ἀντιμισθίαν ἣν ἔδει τῆς πλάνης αὐτῶν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἀπολαμβάνοντες) does not specify exactly what the penalty is (τὴν ἀντιμισθίαν---accusative here, that which is received), nor what their error is (τῆς πλάνης αὐτῶν---genitive here, modifying τὴν ἀντιμισθίαν).</p>

<p>Since it is decidedly ambiguous in the Greek, leaving it ambiguous when translating it into English is a good choice.</p>

</div>


You'll note that of the translations, the NLT actually does not leave things ambiguous, but chooses to interpret in its translation, making the penalty explicitly/specifically tied to the homosexuality. This is typical of the NLT, which is a highly interpretive translation. Like the little girl from the Longfellow poem, when the NLT is good, it is very, very good, but when it is bad, it is horrid. The NIV is much the same, although it is somewhat less interpretive overall.

The issue with this is that it makes it seem like the text could not at all support taking the error as the idolatry/unbelief mentioned earlier in the passage, with the penalty in view then being removal of restraint such that the people in question are given over to the unnatural sexual desires (compare [our past discussion re: God's removal of restraint](/verse-by-verse-studies/romans/romans-1/romans-1-26-does-god-give-up-on-sinners/#gods-removal-of-restraint-does-not-violate-creature-free-will)). Some interpreters in fact think that is really more what is in view here. For example, you might have a look at these posts on the Hermeneutics StackExchange:

- https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/a/35806
- https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/a/35804

These takes are completely different from the interpretation that the NLT's translation forces. So, what are we to make of all this? Which way ought we take things?

### We do not need to make an exclusive choice in interpretation here

I actually do not view this as an exclusive choice at all. Verse 24 directly says that as a result of their unbelief and idolatry, God gave them over to the shameful behavior relating to homosexuality (and compare also the first part of verse 26). But this new sinful behavior had negative consequences of its own too, in turn. In a manner of speaking then, the clause "receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error" is serving to speak to "all of the above":

- Because of their idolatry, God gave them over to the unnatural lusts involved in homosexuality (verse 24 and 26a)
- But also because of this shameful behavior, additional negative consequences too will follow

To the extent that the error is "suppressing the truth" (Romans 1:18), the penalty is "handing them over to a reprobate mind" (Romans 1:28); to the extent that the error is specifically "abandoning natural relations," then the penalty is the natural results of such degrading behavior (see below---the result of sin is always death, and sexual sin specifically comes in for special reproof). This concept of compounding choices and consequences is akin to the virtuous cycle of spiritual growth, but the opposite---a feedback loop of depravity.

Hopefully this explanation makes sense. It can take a bit of squinting to see how the all the bits fit together, but the passage really does make the most sense if you view this clause as being inclusive and broad in its application rather than exclusive and specific.

### The penalty for sin generally: death

To go a bit deeper into what sort of "general consequences" come from sinful behavior (like the degrading of one's body in unnatural sexual relations, as in this specific context):

<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>Romans 6:23a | KJV</strong>
<p>The wages of sin is <strong>death</strong></p>
</div>


<div class="special-content scripture">
<strong>James 1:15 | NIV11</strong>
<p>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, <strong>gives birth to death</strong>.</p>
</div>


The Bible is very clear that sin leads to death. There are actually [three aspects of death](https://ichthys.com/3B-Hamartio.htm#1.%20The%20Three%20Aspects%20of%20Death). When Eve ate from the tree after being tempted by Satan, she did not immediately die *physically* (hence Satan's selection of this half-truth angle of attack), although now she inevitably would eventually. However, she did immediately die *spiritually*---she was instantly cut off from the perfect fellowship with God she had enjoyed up until this point. And this action of hers---absenting a Savior being judged in her place, as foreshadowed by the animal skins God gives in Genesis 3---would lead to *eternal* or ("second") death---separation from God in hell.

For believers, sin separates us from God until we confess and restore our relationship with Him; it *does* inherently cause spiritual death. And if we keep on sinning despite mounting divine discipline, one of the other two types of death will inevitably come into play too. Either God will take us out of the world due to our exceedingly poor witness for His Name (the so-called "sin unto death"), or we will harden ourselves to the truth enough that we actually stop believing (apostasy).

So sin is serious business. We do not at all lose our salvation the moment we sin (or anything even remotely close to that), but should we ever give ourselves over to it completely such that we turn our backs on God, well, the Bible says:

Not inheriting the kingdom of God means not being saved: being subject to the second death.

#### Sexual sin specifically

The passage we just quoted from in 1 Corinthians 6 is quite relevant to our specific context here in Romans 1, for it also goes on to describe the severity of sexual sin specifically:
