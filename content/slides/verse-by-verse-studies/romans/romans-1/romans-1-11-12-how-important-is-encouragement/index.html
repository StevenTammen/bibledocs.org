## Romans 1:11-12 - How important is encouragement?



---


### Summary

Encouragement was Paul's primary reason for wishing to visit Rome, it seems, and is also the primary reason given for Christian assembly in Hebrews 10:24-25. But what we mean by "encouragement" is very much centered around the truth of the Word of God, rather than some of the other things people sometimes improperly elevate to primary importance.

## Romans 1:11-12 - How important is encouragement?

How important is encouragement? Important enough that it seems to be Paul's primary reason for wishing to visit the church in Rome (Romans 1:11-12).

I should note that encouragement is actually given as the primary reason for Christian assembly period in Hebrews 10:24-25. So it is very important indeed!

But what is it, exactly? Are we talking about trying to cheer up people who are feeling down? That can certainly be part of it (see [here](/verse-by-verse-studies/1-thessalonians/1-thessalonians-5/1-thessalonians-5-13b-14-how-ought-we-relate-to-different-groups-of-people/#encourage-the-disheartened) for some of what I've written on the topic of encouraging the disheartened), but it is in fact much more about the truth than mere emotion.

As Christians, we derive encouragement by seeing one another's faith---by seeing the light of God's truth radiate from each other's lives and persons. As one body (compare 1 Corinthians 12), we all need one another, and much of that is by spurring each other ever forward as we build one another up in truth and love (Ephesians 4:15-16).

The Word of God is the essential part of this process, without which none of the rest of it works. If someone is grieving, the Bible speaks of how one might navigate such. If one is struggling with suffering and asking "But why, God?", the Bible also speaks of how one might navigate such. In fact, it contains *everything* God thinks we humans need to know to navigate these lives of ours down here in the world, and is therefore completely unique.

But we need to understand what it says and means before we can be encouraged by it! So, in fact, the largest part of our encouragement as Christians comes not from someone giving pep talks or therapy from the pulpit, but by the Word of God being taught substantively, so that *through its truth* we might be encouraged. By the very words and promises of God, not by mortal man.
