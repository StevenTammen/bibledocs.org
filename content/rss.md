   This ministry maintains RSS feeds that readers can subscribe to in order to stay up to date with site happenings. This page describes these RSS feeds.

You can use an RSS feed reader like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) to stay up to date on new site content without having to check manually (it saves lots of time -- I highly recommend using RSS).

Note that due to some of the advanced functionality on this site (automatic verse tagging, embedded Bible app windows, special content sections, and so on), I *highly* recommend reading content on this site directly, since things don't display completely properly through the XML that drives RSS. The RSS feeds can just help seamlessly get you to new content, if that makes sense.

Below are links to subscribe to subsets of the site's content (in case you are interested in only some of the content, or just want to be able to break things out separately):
