You can use an RSS feed reader like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) to stay up to date on new site content without having to check manually (it saves lots of timeâ€”I highly recommend using RSS). Below are links to subscribe to subsets of the site's content (in case you are interested in only some of the things I write about):
