title: Online Bible Studies

## Overview

There are three online Bible studies that this site runs: a general Bible study, a Greek study, and a Hebrew study. All studies are held and recorded in the same [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) room, which is open to the public:

- Meeting link: <https://zoom.us/j/902995929>
- Passcode: 1189 (the number of chapters in the Bible)

The Greek and Hebrew studies are presently on Saturdays at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (see [conversion to your local time](http://www.timebie.com/std/est.php)), alternating weeks (so in a given four-week month, the Greek study will meet twice and the Hebrew study will meet twice). They typically run about an hour.

The general Bible study is presently on Sundays (every week) at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (see [conversion to your local time](http://www.timebie.com/std/est.php)), and it typically lasts a bit longer, more on the order of two hours. We are currently working our way through [BB6A: Peripateology](https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm), a written study from [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/) that discusses the Christian Walk.

## Guidelines and procedures related to recording

These studies are recorded and then [posted publicly to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFk7khraAKf68DZ5GeYEFIw/playlists). How this works in practice is that after chatting casually for a few minutes (to give folks a bit of wiggle room on the start time), I'll announce that I'm rolling the recording, after which point things proceed more formally.

When the recording is rolling, things are kept as anonymous and impersonal as possible. First names only are used, personal details and circumstances are avoided, and only discussion that is appropriate for a public audience is had.

If anything is said that really shouldn't be public, it *is* possible for me to edit it out in post-production, but it costs me a lot of time. (It is much simpler for me to just upload the full recording unedited). For this reason, I strongly urge all participants to be mindful of what you say at all times.

Note that if you want for me to pause the recording for a time, that is simple to do. For example, if you want to ask some questions about your personal circumstances but don't want such discussion to end up on the public recording, you can simply request that we pause the recording for a time. 

It's perfectly fine if you are late in joining a study, but do keep in mind that you will likely then be joining at a point when the recording is already rolling. As a general rule, there is time at the beginning and end to chat more casually, so if you are new and come in partway, you are welcome to participate in the focused discussion the second you enter, but there may not be a meet-and-greet sort of time for you until after the recording is switched off.

### What's the point of the recordings? 

The recordings are beneficial to people in the studies because they:

1. Make it easy to go back and review things we've talked about.
2. Make it easy for someone who missed a week to stay up-to-speed. 

While it would be possible to have both of these advantages without having the recordings be completely public, making them completely public means that they have the potential to be helpful to absolutely everyone that might want to make use of them.

### Caveats with the recordings

## Privacy and safety

These Bible studies are completely open, meaning that anyone who clicks on the link above can join. This is advantageous since it means everyone who is interested can participate without having to communicate with me beforehand, but it does potentially open us up to bad actors.

Due to the potential issues, there is a strict zero-tolerance policy with regards to unacceptable behavior. 

## These studies are not the place for argument and debate

While myself and other participating teachers do take pains to not be completely authoritarian, these studies are intended to be a place of discussion for people who are legitimately interested in the things taught by this ministry, [Ichthys](https://ichthys.com/), [Bible Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp-J7VPT7NcwmuiNfD2fkg/playlists), and so on.

As a rule of thumb, people who listen and ask good questions are always welcome -- whatever their exact theological persuasion. What I am attempting to get across here is that people who will argue with every single point made and refuse to accept the authority of any of the teachers involved may want to consider looking for a place that is actually explicitly dedicated to apologetics and theological debate, since these studies are not. In other words, to keep these studies focused, we stick more-or-less solely to discussion of the teaching being put forth as true, so if it is theological debate you are looking for (not necessarily a bad thing), this just isn't really the right place.

(To be clear, this has less to do with top-down censoring of differing points of view, and more to do with the fact that our time together is very limited, and most people participating would prefer to spend it on discussion rather than debate, if that makes sense).

You should be able to get a feel for if these studies are likely to be a good fit for you based on these past recordings.

  3. Since the audience for these studies is global (there are folks from Nigeria and Australia participating, for example), the time scheduling is a bit complex, and subject to change.


As a rule of thumb, people who are willing to seriously listen and learn are always welcome. The screening process is mostly trying to ensure that everyone participating wants to be there (e.g., won't be arguing with every single point), and will take the time seriously.


  * I typically clear people I don't know in person via a one-on-one Zoom meeting to get to know them a bit. It's not anything like a test, just a casual chat, so please don't be afraid to reach out. You should be able to know if the groups are likely to be a good fit for you since all the recordings of group meetings [are publicly posted on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFk7khraAKf68DZ5GeYEFIw/playlists).
