### Lesson content

#### Introduction to the pilgrimage analogy

> "I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not ***walk*** in darkness, but will have the light of life."  
> John 8:12b

The Christian life is often compared to a journey, walking with Jesus Christ day by day and following Him to the end. The prevalence of this analogy in scripture is the reason for the title of this study, "Peripateology", the study of the Christian walk, with the coinage being based upon the most common word for walking in the New Testament, *peripateo* (cf. English "peripatetic"). And while this Greek word can and often does refer to literal walking, more often than not it is used in the Bible in a metaphorical way to describe our behavior in this world. Sometimes this relates to unbelievers or lapsed believers (Mk.7:5; Jn.6:66; Eph.2:2; Col.3:7), but usually it is employed to guide Christians in the way in which we ought to be walking in this world (cf. 2Cor.10:2-3; 12:18):

<!-- --- -->

#### Ways in which should walk

We should walk in the light and not in the dark so as not to stumble (Jn.11:9-10).

We should walk in the light while we still can before the darkness comes (Jn.12:35).

We should walk in newness of life (Rom.6:4).

We should walk according to the Spirit and not according to the flesh (Rom.8:1-4).

We should walk in a seemly way as in the day, and not in revelry, drunkenness, lewdness, lust, strife and envy (Rom.13:13).

<!-- --- -->

We should walk in love so as not to grieve our brothers and sisters in Christ (Rom.14:15).

We should walk as spiritual (following the Spirit) and not as carnal (following the sin nature) in envy and strife (1Cor.3:3).

We should walk being satisfied with the gifts, provision and circumstances the Lord has given us (1Cor.7:17).

We should walk in the Spirit, by means of the Spirit (Gal.5:16).

We should walk in the accomplishment of the good works that the Lord has prepared for us to do (Eph.2:10).

<!-- --- -->

We should walk worthily of our calling in Jesus Christ (Eph.4:1).

We should not walk as unbelievers do in futility of mind, darkened understanding, alienation from God, ignorance of the truth, hardness of heart, insensitivity to the Spirit, being abandoned to lewdness, uncleanness, greediness (Eph.4:17).

We should walk in love (Eph.5:2).

We should walk as children of the light (Eph.5:8).

We should take care how we walk, not as fools but as those who are wise (Eph.5:15).

<!-- --- -->

We should walk as the godly walk, not like the ungodly (Phil.3:17-18; cf. Ps.1:1).

We should walk worthy of the Lord pleasing Him, with good works, increasing knowledge of God, strengthened in all His might, and in all patience, longsuffering and joy, ever giving thanks (Col.1:10-12).

We should continue walking now just as we received Jesus as our Savior, rooted and built up in Him, established in faith with thanksgiving. (Col.2:6-7).

We should walk in wisdom towards those who do not believe (Col.4:5).

We should walk worthily of God (1Thes.2:12).

<!-- --- -->

We should walk as we have been taught to in order to please God (1Thes.4:1).

We should walk in a decent manner towards those who are not believers (1Thes.4:12).

We should avoid those who walk in a disorderly way (2Thes.3:6; cf. 2Thes.3:11).

We should walk in the light (1Jn.1:7, not in the darkness (1Jn.1:6; 2:11).

We should walk as Jesus walked (1Jn.2:6).

We should walk in the truth (2Jn.1:4-6; 3Jn.1:4-5).

<!-- --- -->

#### We ought to walk a worthy walk, not forgetting our purpose

In other words, we believers in Jesus Christ are not to be walking about aimlessly; rather we are to be ever walking with Jesus Christ through this dark world, progressing along a definite track in a specific direction for a certain purpose: to cross the finish line of this life and enter into the presence of the Lord, pleasing Him with our walk here and now and reaping the corresponding rewards when we finally see Him face to face. And ***how*** we walk in this world before that time makes all the difference.

> (9) For this reason we also from the [very] day we heard [of your love] do not cease praying on your behalf and asking that you be fulfilled in regard to the full acceptance of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, (10) that you might ***walk worthy*** of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by means of the full knowledge of God.  
> Colossians 1:9-10

<!-- --- -->

#### Sometimes we may need to fight our way back onto the high road of Zion

Times may be hard. But we keep moving. There may opposition. But we keep moving. All manner of things may happen which seem to conspire against us so as to knock us off the high road to Zion, but we persevere, fighting our way back onto the road, a narrow one which leads upward in only one, positive direction, and making it our dearest desire to walk worthily of our Lord on this journey as the passage above exhorts us to do.

<!-- --- -->

#### Psalm 84 and the pilgrimage analogy

> (5) Happy is everyone whose strength is in You. Their hearts are set on the highways [of pilgrimage to Zion]. (6) As they pass through the [dry] valley of Bachah (lit., "weeping"; i.e., the wilderness of life), they make it a place of springs. Even the early rains enwrap it with [their] blessings. (7) They go from strength to strength, until they appear before God in Zion.  
> Psalm 84:5-7 NIV (cf. Is.35:8-10; Is.55:11; Jer.31:12; 31:6; 50:5)

In this pilgrimage of ours, wonderfully symbolized by the passage above, we are treading a narrow road (Matt.7:13-14; cf. Lk.13:24), taking pains not to turn to the left (after pleasures and personal interests) or the right (out of fear or worry) but to head straight to Zion so as to please our Lord.

<!-- --- -->

#### We are following the Spirit's guidance

We are following the Spirit's guidance (Gal.5:16), listening to His "still, small voice" (1Ki.19:12), so as to keep close to the dear Shepherd who is guiding us, the One who is leading us to good pasture (provision for physical needs on the journey), to clear, cool water (provision for spiritual needs on the journey), leading us ever on the right and righteous way, and keeping us safe even from darkness of death by ever-present protection (Ps.23:1-4).

<!-- --- -->

#### We are walking through the desert, towards the lands of promise

We are walking through the desert of this world to the land of promise that awaits us, confident that our feet will not swell nor our shoes or clothing wear out, confident that our every need will be met until we cross Jordan's river into the glory that awaits (Deut.8:4; Neh.9:21).

We move forward day by day, one day at a time, carrying our crosses toward our final day in emulation of the Lord who bought us (Matt.10:38; 16:24-26; Mk.8:34; Lk.9:23; 14:27), and merely sojourning in this world in the meantime, being strangers to it just as all our spiritual fathers were (1Chron.29:15; Ps.39:12; 1Pet.1:1-2; 1:17; 2:11), looking forward to the promised goal of the calling to which we have been called, and not to the temporary lust, dust and rust of this wicked world -- and never looking back (Lk.17:32).

<!-- --- -->

> (13) These all died [while still walking] in faith, though they had not received the [fulfillment of their] promises. But [while they lived] they did catch sight of [these promises] from a distance and salute them, [so to speak], thus making it plain [to all the world] that they were [in effect] strangers and sojourners on the earth. (14) For people who express [their faith] in this way make it quite evident that they are eagerly in search of a homeland [other than the place they now occupy]. (15) Indeed, if these [believers'] hearts had yearned for the [land] from which they had departed, they would have had [ample] opportunity to turn back. (16) But they were zealous for a better place, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. He has, in fact, prepared a city for them (i.e., the New Jerusalem).  
> Hebrews 11:13-16

### Content

#### Our objective as Christians: grow closer to God while walking with Him through this life

Our objective as believers in Jesus Christ is to walk through this world with Him in an acceptable way, drawing closer to Him in our Christian walk day by day so as to grow, progress and produce. Closeness to God the Father and to our dear Lord Jesus Christ in our brief sojourn here in this world is an important aspect of our Christian walk.

> Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts!  
> Psalm 65:4a, NIV

> But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.  
> Psalm 73:28, NKJV

> The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.  
> Psalm 145:18, NKJV

> "For who is the one who has devoted his heart to come close to Me?", says the Lord.  
> Jeremiah 30:21b, translation from Ichthys

<!-- --- -->

> "Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him."  
> John 14:23, NKJV

> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  
> Hebrews 7:19, KJV

> Come closer to God, and He will come closer to you.  
> James 4:8 (cf. Is.55:6-7; Zech.1:3; Mal.3:7), translation from Ichthys

<!-- --- -->

#### Closeness to God means turning our back on the world

Closeness to God means turning our back on the world (Jas.4:4; 1Jn.2:15-17), and the desires of the flesh (Rom.6:6; 7:5-6; Eph.4:22; Col.3:9; 1Pet.4:3), and results in greater joy of fellowship with Him we as progress through the truth on our spiritual journey (1Cor.1:9; 1Pet.1:8; 1Jn.1:3-4).

Nearness to the Lord and close fellowship with Him is the result of walking our Christian walk in a way that pleases Him. That has always been the case:

> We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.  
> Hebrews 6:12, NKJV

> Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.  
> Hebrews 13:7, NKJV

> Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.  
> James 5:10, NKJV

> Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good.  
> 3rd John 1:11, NKJV

<!-- --- -->

#### On the idea of imitating role models

As these verses remind us, good role models to imitate go a long way towards showing us how to walk in this world.

When we imitate someone truly worthy of imitation, it has a tendency to cut through all doctrinal and theological complications and demonstrate for us "the entire package" so as to be able to "go and do likewise" immediately.

For that reason, there are worse things a believer could do than to set him/herself to emulating the lives of the great believers of the Bible (their spiritually positive qualities, that is). Such can be a valuable way of encouraging ourselves and empowering our Christian walk, shining a bright light upon our defects and reinforcing the good we are doing.

> (32) Now what shall I say more? For time would fail me, were I to go on and relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Sampson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, (33) who through their faith defeated kingdoms, accomplished acts of righteousness, received the fulfillment of promises, shut the mouths of lions, (34) quenched the power of fire, fled the mouth of the sword, were made strong in weakness, were made powerful in war, defeated enemy armies -- (35) women even received back their dead. (36) Some [of these great believers of the past] were tortured, refusing release, that they might obtain a better resurrection (i.e., worth more to them than their lives; cf. Ps.63:3. Others endured ridicule and beatings, and even chains and imprisonment. (37) They were stoned, sawed in half, killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goat hides. They were deprived, persecuted, abused. (38) The world was not worthy of them. They wandered the deserts and the mountains, making their homes in caves and fissures in the earth. (39) And through their faith, all of them though they became witnesses [to the world] (lit., "were martyred"), yet they did not receive the promise (i.e., resurrection and reward), (40) since God was looking forward for our sakes to something better, so that they might not be made perfect (i.e., resurrected and rewarded) without us.  
> Hebrews 11:32-40, translation from Ichthys

<!-- --- -->

#### This list is not comprehensive

In the spirit of this passage, the list of believers we will go over is offered only by way of example, lest "time should fail us". Investigating the life of David would require a book; considering the example of our Lord, an encyclopedia -- for He is the ultimate example to us all.

It is hoped that as the principles taught throughout this study are learned and digested through faith, the strengths and positive qualities of all the greats of scripture will be seen ever more clearly as the Bible is read daily, and that the positive attributes of these believers, demonstrated in the effectiveness and rich texture of their individual walks with the Lord, will be more easily and more joyously adapted to our own. For there is much to emulate even in a very brief perusal of some of the more outstanding believers of the Bible.

<!-- --- -->

#### Enoch

> Enoch made a practice of walking [diligently] with God -- then he was no more, because God took him [to Himself].  
> Genesis 5:24, translation from Ichthys

> By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, "and was not found, because God had taken him"; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  
> Hebrews 11:5, translation from Ichthys

We know very little about Enoch, but we know all we need to know.

Both in the genealogy of the line of faith in Genesis and in the catalog of great believers in Hebrews he is included for his consistency of spiritual growth, walking with God closely, diligently and persistently, so much so that he is recorded by the Spirit as having "pleased God", and was rewarded with an early release from the troubles of this world in a unique manner (i.e., transmutation rather than conventional physical death).

Enoch is in for a great eternal reward, no doubt. Let us emulate his efforts in making our walk with the Lord more constant and closer each day.

<!-- --- -->

#### Noah

> These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations. Noah, moreover, made a habit of walking with God.  
> Genesis 6:9, translation from Ichthys

> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.  
> Genesis 6:22, NIV

> The Lord then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation."  
> Genesis 7:1, NIV

> And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.  
> Genesis 7:5, NIV

Noah's walk with God is described in Hebrews in the very same terms as was that of Enoch. 

Moreover, Noah was called upon by the Lord to do things no one had ever done before -- and he did them, ***all*** of them, consistently, and in precisely the way in which the Lord commanded him to do them. Nor does scripture give us any indication that he was hesitant or complained in any way.

That would be a marvel of obedience and spiritual consistency at any time, but in the midst of a generation so perverse that "all flesh" outside of Noah and his family had "corrupted their way" (Gen.6:12), Noah's example is truly amazing.

<!-- --- -->

Difficult times are coming for us too. A flood of sorts, and a worldwide one too. And we too are called upon to build an ark to survive that coming flood, not a literal wooden boat, but a vessel of truth in our hearts capable of staying afloat no matter what storms and swells the riptides of tribulation bear us into.

Like Noah, let us be consistent in our obedient preparation that we may not only survive that flood but spiritually thrive in its midst, offering the refuge of truth to all who come to our light (cf. Ezek.14:14; 14:20; 1Pet.3:20-21).

> By faith, Noah, when divinely informed about things which were not yet visible, in reverent piety constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, through which [same] faith [by responding to God] he condemned the world and became heir to the righteousness which is [awarded] according to faith.  
> Hebrews 11:7, translation from Ichthys

<!-- --- -->

#### Abraham

> (8) By faith, Abraham, when He was called [by God], obeyed and went forth into the place he was destined to receive as an inheritance. He went forth, moreover, in ignorance of where [exactly] he was heading. (9) By faith, he sojourned as an alien in the land he had been promised, dwelling in tents with Jacob and Isaac, coheirs of [this same] promise. (10) For he was waiting for the foundation of that city (i.e., the New Jerusalem) whose architect and builder is God.  
> Hebrews 11:8-10, translation from Ichthys

> (17) By faith Abraham offered up Isaac when he was tested, and was on the point of offering up [in sacrifice] his one and only son, the one who [about whom he] had received the promises, (18) about whom it had been said, "In Isaac shall your seed be called", (19) [for Abraham was] reckoning that God was able to raise [him] from the dead, whence (i.e., from the dead) he did receive [Isaac] back even metaphorically (i.e., Isaac was as good as dead but God delivered him through the substitute of the ram, a type of Jesus Christ).  
> Hebrews 11:17-19, translation from Ichthys

In many important ways, Abraham is ***the*** example for believers. He obeyed the Lord, even when it was hard, even when he had no clear idea of where he was going (the land of promise) or what he was doing or why (sacrificing Isaac).

He was not perfect, but he always recovered from his mistakes, and demonstrated his true, solid and deep faith in the Lord by his patience, waiting until he was a hundred years old for the birth of the heir he so longed for. And without hesitation and in complete faith in the Lord in spite of the rending of his heart, he was willing to offer that heir up as a sacrifice -- because he ***trusted*** the Lord no matter what.

<!-- --- -->

Therefore when it comes to faith, Abraham "is the father of us all" (Rom.4:16), and the perfect model of resilient, consistent, obedient faith that trusts in the Lord and in His promises regardless of what the eyes may see or the ears hear or the emotions feel.

Let us resolve to follow in his footsteps of dynamic faith whatever this life brings, because, like Abraham, we too are "waiting for the foundation of that city whose architect and builder is God" (Heb.11:10).

**Jacob**

> Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."  
> Genesis 32:28, NIV

Unwilling to cross the river into Canaan without the Lord's blessing, Jacob hung onto the Lord for dear life, even to the point of being rendered partially lame for refusing to let go. This action, which gains him the name "Israel", or "he who wrestles with God", is an apt reminder of the "wrestling faith" of the father of the twelve patriarchs. Jacob had a difficult life, as he himself attests (Gen.47:9, and his name "Jacob" is often invoked in referring to Israel when in difficulty and under pressure (as in the Tribulation being referred to as "the time of Jacob's trouble": Jer.30:7. But the patriarch Israel never let go of the Lord, and that is precisely the type of "wrestling faith" we all have need of when times are tough -- and especially if it be our lot to endure the toughest time of all, the Great Tribulation. Let us therefore resolve like Jacob to hold onto the Lord in faith for all we are worth, never even thinking of letting Him go until He likewise touches us and releases us and brings us home to be with Him.

**Joseph**

> How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.  
> Psalm 119:9, ESV

While not referencing Joseph personally, the verse above perfectly exemplifies his life as we are given to know it from scripture. Joseph served his father Israel with purity and integrity, even when it aggravated his brothers (to ultimate near-fatal effect). He told his brothers and his father the truth about his dream, even when it made him appear arrogant in their eyes. He served Potiphar with diligence even as a slave, and with loyalty, even when tempted by his wife, refusing to have anything to do with her, though it landed him in prison as a result. And instead of becoming sullen and blaming God -- as so many have done in this life, even many who should know better -- Joseph continued to act with purity of character while in prison, serving faithfully in all he was given to do. And in the end, God delivered him and made him ruler over all of Egypt. 

If we read carefully, we can see how the Lord was preparing Joseph, teaching him deep humility and giving him multiple opportunities to refine his administrative skills, and multiple tests too, to remind him to trust the Lord and to be a good witness to the Lord even when things were going oh so wrong -- from the human point of view. But we have the benefit of historical hindsight, and, indeed, we are meant to use it -- that is the entire purpose of scriptures such as this (Rom.15:4. And we know the end of the severe testing and difficult course of preparation the Lord put Joseph through . . . but it is good to consider that it all would have been for naught if Joseph had not held tight to his purity and integrity, doing what was right in the eyes of men -- and, even much more importantly, doing what was right in the eyes of God, trusting in Him no matter what.

> "But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive."  
> Genesis 50:20, NKJV

Let us then resolve to follow in Joseph's footsteps, holding fast to a pure way of life and serving with integrity in all we have been given to do, whether in worldly things or spiritual ones. For while there may be trouble along the way, the end of trusting the Lord deeply as Joseph did is all for the good, the absolute, divine good.

> And we know that everything works together for good . . . ***for those who love God***.  
> Romans 8:28a, translation from Ichthys

**Moses**

He was raised as the son of Pharaoh's daughter, "educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" (Acts 7:22), and when in later years he saw an Egyptian persecuting one of his countrymen, he slew the offender (Ex.2:12), an act which led to his exile (Ex.2:15). These may not seem to be the actions of a humble person, but on that point we have the definitive testimony of scripture:

> Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all men who were on the face of the earth.  
> Numbers 12:3, NKJV

True humility is not for show but resides in the heart. Moses was a man who more than any other of his generation -- and perhaps of all time -- deeply understood the infinite disparity between God's greatness and his own comparative nothingness. This is of course something all Christians should and even all unbelievers do understand intellectually (early in life before they begin to harden their hearts). But Moses actually believed it, understood it therefore through faith by the Spirit, and continually acted upon it. While this humility sometimes comes out in a negative way (e.g., Ex.4:10-14 -- none of us is perfect, after all), it is a hallmark of most everything scripture tells about Moses, a man who seldom confronted God with his own ego, accepting completely instead the wisdom and the power and the authority of the Lord.

> "And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord; for He hears your complaints against the Lord. But what are we, that you complain against us?"  
> Exodus 16:7, NKJV

Few believers in history have been willing to put "You, Lord" before "I, Lord" in the way that Moses consistently did. But that, after all, is the fundamental principle of trust and faithful obedience through which we are saved and with which we grow and pass tests and minister to the people of God. Let us follow Moses' example and be determined to put more "You" and less "I" into our daily lives for the glory of Jesus Christ and the edification of His Church.

**Job**

> (10) My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and patience. (11) Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and seen the end intended by the Lord---that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.  
> James 5:10-11, KJV

As James affirms and as we all know quite well, Job's patience is proverbial. And it is good to remember that while in the end he succumbed to the misguided reproaches of his comforters, the trials that had come upon him were neither accidental nor punishment from God. Indeed, they came upon him precisely because he ***was*** walking so closely with the Lord as to be an example for Him to throw in Satan's face.

> Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause."  
> Job 2:3, NKJV

Let us resolve not only to be like Job, fearing God, shunning evil, walking closely to the Lord in an upright and blameless way, but also to do the things Job did to become the great man of faith he truly was: putting the Lord, His Word, and His people first in everything we think and say and do. If we do that, then we need have no fear of anything that may befall us in this life -- not even the trials and troubles of Job -- because we have "seen the end intended by the Lord" (Jas.5:11).

**David**

Here is another great man of God about whom books could be written (and certainly have been). What can we say about a man so great in his faith that he was given to have in his lineage an even greater Son, the Messiah Himself (2Sam.7:11-16; Ps.2:1ff.; 110:1ff.; Matt.1:1; 12:35; Lk.1:32)? A man whose kingship presages and prefigures the millennial reign of Christ? A man who was given to write some of the most beautiful passages in all of scripture? While there is much we could say, our focus here is on David as an exemplar, as a model for us to imitate in our Christian walk. And while we all, no doubt, admire his courage in slaying Goliath, his constancy in bearing up under some of the most difficult trials when Saul was hunting him down, and his righteous reign (with one notable exception) over God's people Israel, the one salient characteristic of David which stands out beyond the others is his exceptional joy in the Lord and love for the Lord.

> You have put gladness in my heart,  
> More than in the season that their grain and wine increased.  
> Psalm 4:7, NKJV
>
> But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You;  
> Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them;  
> Let those also who love Your name  
> Be joyful in You.  
> Psalm 5:11, NKJV
>
> O Lord, our Lord,  
> How excellent is Your name in all the earth!  
> Psalm 8:9, NKJV
>
> I will be glad and rejoice in You;  
> I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.  
> Psalm 9:2, NKJV
>
> But I have trusted in Your mercy;  
> My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.  
> Psalm 13:5, NKJV
>
> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices;  
> My flesh also will rest in hope.  
> Psalm 16:9, NKJV
>
> I will love You, O Lord, my strength.  
> Psalm 18:1, NKJV

David was unloved as a child for reasons scripture never discloses. He was the youngest, yet his mother is never directly mentioned. If she died in childbirth with him, that would explain his father's hard attitude against him (e.g., 1Sam.16:11). Instead of living a pampered life, David was set to watching the family's flock from an early age, and while some react to harsh treatment by becoming sullenly self-reliant, David responded to it by putting His trust in the Lord, and finding in the Lord the love and the joy that the world denied him.

> From birth I was cast on you; from my mother's womb you have been my God.  
> Psalm 22:10, NIV
>
> (6) I have leaned on you since birth; you pulled me from my mother's womb. I praise you continually. (7) Many are appalled when they see me, but you are my secure shelter.  
> Psalm 76:6-7, NET

Through many lonely days and lonelier nights, David spent the time he had to spare not in day-dreaming but in contemplating the truth he knew, in praying to the Lord and fellowshipping with Him, in remembering and applying the scriptures to everything he was experiencing, not just learning and considering the Word, but in actually living the Word -- and so much so that the Lord truly became His joy and His one true love. David did this without many -- or perhaps any -- of the advantages we have today. So he stands as a premier example of what can be accomplished spiritually if the will is there, if the joy is there. This love and joy for the Lord with which David was thoroughly imbued sustained him even in times of the most severe testing (e.g., 1Sam.30:6), and even on those rare but notable occasions when David was in the wrong. For we see Him pouring out his heart to the Lord when forgiveness is needful too, not in cowardly fear but in great confidence of the grace and mercy of the One He knew so well, our dear Lord and Savior. Truly, this was a man after the Lord's own heart (1Sam.13:14), one who perhaps came closer than any other believer to loving the Lord with all the joy He is due.

> "And when He had removed [Saul], He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.' "  
> Act 13:22, NKJV

Let us then like David make it our daily purpose never to forget the joy of our salvation (Ps.51:12; Is.12:3; Hab.3:18), won for us by the One we love more than life, our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  
> The king shall have joy in Your strength, O Lord;  
> And in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!  
> Psalm 21:1, NKJV

What more shall we say then about all the great host of witnesses who went before us and now watch our progress in this world? For time would fail us if we sought to speak of them all, of Elijah and his zeal for the Lord and fervency in prayer (1Ki.19:10-14; Jas.5:16b); of Daniel and his faithfulness, courage and wisdom (Dan.1:8; 6:5; 6:23; 9:23); of Peter and the resiliency of his faith (Lk.22:31-32); of John and his great love for the Lord and His Church (Jn.20:2; 21:7; 21:20); of Paul and his dedication to Jesus Christ despite immense suffering (Acts 9:16; 1Cor.4:8-13; 2Cor.4:7-12; 6:3-10; 11:16-33; Phil.3:7-11), and of the great women of scripture too, of Sarah, Rebecca, Rahab, Deborah and Jael, Ruth, Tamar, Hannah, Elisabeth, Mary, Phoebe, and Prisca the wife of Aquila -- and so many more, some named but many more unknown to us, yet whose names are written in heaven along with ours (Lk.10:20). They ran this race, they finished this course, they fought this fight, they drank this bitter cup called life right down to the dregs, but in whatever they had to suffer, they never renounced Jesus Christ our dear Lord and Savior. And so like us, they have in store a resurrection and life eternal which is better to a yet unknowable degree than anything the human heart can yet imagine (Heb.11:35; cf. Heb.11:16).

> (22) But you have come [not to Mount Sinai but] to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, [that is, you have come to] the Heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of [elect] angels in assembly [before God], (23) and to the Church of the firstborn enrolled [as its citizens] in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of justified [believers] [who have now] completed [their tasks], (24) and to Jesus, the Mediator of a better covenant, and to sprinkled blood (i.e., the work of Christ in bearing our sins) which speaks [far] more powerfully than that of Abel['s sacrifice].  
> Hebrews 12:22-24, translation from Ichthys

All these died not having received the promise, having lived out their lives in faithful pilgrimage (Heb.11:13, waiting for the return of the One they loved just as we are doing (1Cor.1:7. Let us then as all the faithful witnesses of the past have done set our hearts on the resurrection, on the reward, and on the return of our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ whom we love more than life, following in ***His*** footsteps so as to be pleasing to Him now, in hopes of hearing "well done!" from Him on the great day to come -- for ***He*** is our ultimate model and example.^[18]
