### Week 57.1: We need to remember to not take things personally

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

---

#### 9. We need to remember to not take things personally

- It is very easy to take what happens to us in this life personally â€“- as if the devil were opposing us for individual reasons... whereas in fact he opposes us because we belong to Jesus Christ (John 15:18-20).
- Since it is a very easy mistake to make, we need to take special care to remember ***not*** to "take it personally" when we are attacked, harassed, and subjected to various sorts of flak from the evil one and his minions.
- If we feel led to complain or get bitter at God or otherwise get overly focused on our own personal troubles, then we should remember that this life is not about us. Instead, we ought to recognize that we are in the midst of a great spiritual conflict that is so much bigger than little us.
