### Week 57.3: It is imperative not to become overly focused on ourselves if and when we fail

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

#### 11. It is imperative not to become overly focused on ourselves if and when we fail

- This Christian life we are leading is not about us â€“ it is all about Jesus Christ and honoring Him. We need to keep this in mind if and when we sin -- for all sin (Romans 3:23; cf. James 3:2)
- Confession of sin leads to forgiveness immediately and in every case (1 John 1:9; cf. Psalm 32:5; 51:1-19).
- We certainly should not feel good about our failures or consider them of little account (and the divine discipline we receive, especially for serious broaches of our Christian witness, will suffice to eliminate the latter: Heb.12:4ff.), but we also cannot afford to let ourselves "be wearied and faint in [our] minds" (Heb.12:3 KJV).
- In short, we cannot permit ourselves to allow self-pity or self-revulsion or inordinate guilt or any other emotional reaction to occasional failure stop us from moving forward spiritually.
- The important takeaway is that while everyone fails, not everyone recovers rapidly from failure. The successful mature believer learns to leave the discipline to the Lord, even as he/she is striving to "resist to the point of blood" in the struggle against sin (Hebrews 12:4).

#### 11. It is imperative not to become overly focused on ourselves if and when we fail

- Temptation is part and parcel of the "flak" we are flying through on our spiritual mission, and sin is the occasional "hit" we take.
- Nonetheless, we cannot "bail out" or "land the plane" or "turn back" every time we get hit. We have to keep on flying, accepting the fact that we are not conducting a perfect mission -- no one ever does -- and resolving with each failure to do better the next time, neither yielding to sin nor wallowing in despair for every mistake. 
- The successful mature believer takes sin seriously and makes progress in combating it at every level -- but he/she is also always very quick to recover from stumbling, taking his/her lumps of discipline and getting back into the fight, back into the race just as rapidly as possible. 
- Our time on this earth is very limited, and we most assuredly do ***not*** have the time to take ourselves out of action for any length of time just because we "feel bad" for some failure or other. And if that has always been true for believers in Christ, how much more is it not an important principle to grasp for us "upon whom the end of the ages has come" (1 Corinthians 10:11).
