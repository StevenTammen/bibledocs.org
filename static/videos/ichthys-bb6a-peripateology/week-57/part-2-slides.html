### Week 57.2: God will not test us beyond what we can bear

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

---

#### 10. God will not test us beyond what we can bear

- God knows that this is hard. And He knows very well when we are having a hard time bearing up. He sees all of our tears, even before we shed them.
- We have His promise from scripture -- a promise that will never be broken -- that He will never let things go too far, past the point of our actual capability to handle the testing that comes our way (1 Corinthians 10:13). Our job is to trust Him that this is so, whenever we are feeling down, or depressed, or "ridden too hard".
- Our job is to remember that there is a purpose for everything we suffer and this sharing in Christ's sufferings is "the will of God for you" â€“ and so give thanks instead of allowing ourselves to mope and complain (1 Thessalonians 5:18).

#### 10. God will not test us beyond what we can bear

- God will most definitely bring us safely through the valley of the death-shadow, if only we have faith and trust Him.
- If we make it our determined purpose to walk through that dark valley with Him, in knowledge of Him, in trust of Him, then we most definitely will feel the comfort of His "rod and staff", the implements of the Shepherd who cares for us like no other, and who can defend us from whatever may come and bring us safely through to the other side.
- He has given us His Holy Spirit to comfort us in all we have to endure in this world, and that comfort is like nothing the world can offer (2 Corinthians 2:1-7).
- ***Our*** job is to trust that the truth ***is*** true, and to walk and act and speak and behave as if we ***actually do believe it*** -- which of course we do... if we lean into our faith.
