### Week 58.1: Our objective in this world has nothing to do with this world

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

---

#### 12. Our objective in this world has nothing to do with this world

- Our objective is pleasing Jesus Christ. Getting nearer to Him day by day, loving Him more day by day, reveling in His Word, serving His Church, walking closer to Him with every step -- that is what we should be about.
- This world has a way of clouding our spiritual vision and receives great help from its present ruler and from our sin natures in so doing.
- Even if we lost everything, having Jesus Christ is better than everything else put together. And even if we had everything this world seems to offer, it would be nothing in comparison to the eternal life we have in Him.
- Everything the world could ever give is absolutely nothing in comparison to the smallest reward for faithful service meted out at the judgment seat of Christ.

#### 12. Our objective in this world has nothing to do with this world

- If we "seek first the kingdom" (Matthew 6:33), that is, put the Lord and His truth in first place in our hearts, everything else in this world will fall into place. But if we allow our priorities to be distorted, everything else will suffer spiritually.
- Keeping the correct priorities requires a bold, faith-filled approach, one that walks straight ahead through this temporary world, neither shunning it like monks who hide away from the world to avoid its potential entanglements, nor compromising with the world in allowing what is really important -- the truth, learning it, living it, and helping others to do the same -- to drop out of first place in our hearts (Revelation 2:4).
