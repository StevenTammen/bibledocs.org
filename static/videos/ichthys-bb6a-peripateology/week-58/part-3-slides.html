### Week 58.3: Defense is no substitute for offense in spiritual growth, but it is also important to maintain at all times

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

#### 14. Defense is no substitute for offense in spiritual growth, but it is also important to maintain at all times

Some verses on the subject:

> He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly,
> He who despises the gain of oppressions,
> Who gestures with his hands, refusing bribes,
> Who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed,
> And shuts his eyes from seeing evil:
> He will dwell on high.
>
> Isaiah 33:15-16a, NKJV

> **19** Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity."  **20** But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. **21** Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.  **22** Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

> 2nd Timothy 2:10-22, NKJV

#### 14. Defense is no substitute for offense in spiritual growth, but it is also important to maintain at all times

- Departing from the study for a second here, I think it is prudent for us to discuss the mechanisms in play that make this point worth emphasizing.
- We have been very adamant about emphasizing the importance of offense in the spiritual life, how change for us only comes from the inside out. So why do we need to talk about defense?
- Because the less we drop the ball on defense, the more time we have for offense!
   - Recall that one of the recent points we spent time discussing was how we shouldn't focus on ourselves if and when we sin, but get our head back in the game as quickly as possible. As opposed to merely recovering more quickly like we talked about there, the idea here is that sinning less means that *all* recovery time can be avoided since we never fell to begin with.
- Nonetheless, the reason why the focus has been and will continue to be on offense is because defense actually doesn't help you move forward spiritually, it just helps you avoid losing your momentum and/or slipping backwards. So just as no sports team ever won by playing defense without scoring, so too will we be unsuccessful in our spiritual lives if we never go on offense in our spiritual growth.
