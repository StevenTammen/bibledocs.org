### Week 56.2: This life is not about how we feel; we are soldiers in the only conflict that truly matters

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

---

#### 6. This life is not about what we see or hear, nor especially about what or how we may feel

- Rather, living one day at a time as unto Christ, this life is about what we know is true *by faith*.
- We all have emotions, and our feelings as well as our bodies do and will hurt from time to time, but whatever our disappointment, pain or trouble, it is possible to see God with the eyes of faith, even in pain and deprivation, and to understand that everything that is happening is His will for us (1 Thessalonians 5:18), and therefore it is "good" even when our feelings, our eyes and our ears tell us otherwise.
- Why? Because God always works everything out for the absolute good in the end for those who truly love Him (Romans 8:28).

---

#### 7. We are soldiers in the only conflict in this world that has ever truly mattered

- We are soldiers of Jesus Christ, the Lord of Hosts Himself. We are members of the most elite military unit ever formed, the Church of Jesus Christ.
- As such, we are constantly being opposed by an unseen enemy whose attacks we would never be able to resist without the power of God's Spirit who dwells within us. 
- We are not here in this world to cower in our bunkers -- the Lord does not lead an army of cowards. No, the Church of Jesus Christ is an organization dedicated to spiritual advance, and if we are only willing to take the fight to the enemy the way our Lord intends (through spiritual growth, progress and production), then even "the gates of hell" cannot stop our offensive (Matthew 16:18).
- This is all spiritually true now, but will become literally true when we take our place in the heavenly ranks beside our Lord at the battle of Armageddon.
