### Week 56.1: Revisiting idea of walking/pilgrimage; starting to recap various points from all throughout

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm)

---

#### Back to the walking metaphor (rather than the battlefield metaphor)

We've been talking about the Christian life as a spiritual battlefield for such a long time now that perhaps it may seem but a distant memory when we last talked about the thing from which this study derives its name: life as walk or journey for us as Christians. From the Ichthys study:

> (5) Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.  (6) As they pass through the Valley of Baka ("weeping"), they make it a place of springs (lit., "blessings); the autumn rains also cover it with pools. (7) They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.
>
> Psalm 84:5-7 NIV

"We have now covered all of the major points necessary to demonstrate the necessity and the desirability of persevering in this pilgrimage to which we have been called, as well as the means, the methods, and the tactics of so doing.  Nevertheless, it will be helpful to summarize here some of the basic principles to bear in mind, in order to help us keep walking forward on the high road to Zion."

#### Back to the walking metaphor (rather than the battlefield metaphor)

At this point, we've covered an awful lot of ground, so even though some or even many of these points may seem a bit repetitive, it will be good for us to recap to remind ourselves of the sorts of things we should hold in our minds to keep us walking on the high road to Zion.

---

#### 1. This world is a battlefield hostile towards us

- Not the garden of Eden or some other paradise.
- It is ruled by the evil one; we are but interlopers.
- We are in this world but not of it (John 17:11, 16).
- If we follow Christ, the world will never be friendly towards us, and if we attempt to befriend it, we make ourselves enemies of God (James 4:4, 1 John 2:15).

---

#### 2. Everything in this world is temporary

- The things the world strives for are folly because they cannot endure.
- Moreover, no amount of money, power, celebrity, pleasure or possessions can ever make anyone truly happy â€“ at least not for long. That is a myth -- "myth happiness."
- The eternal spiritual rewards we chase as Christians, in contrast, will last forever, and will earn us glory and praise and honor before the throne of Christ.

---

#### 3. This life and the Christian walk in which we are persevering is all about choice

- We can choose to compromise, or we can choose to be red hot for God, "fervent in spirit" (Romans 12:11), keeping our hearts focused on Him (Psalm 86:11), turning away from all double-mindedness (Psalm 119:113).
- We should keep the Lord and His will for us in the top priority spot in our lives, always.

---

#### 4. You are not alone, ever

- The Lord Jesus Christ is in you and with you at all times, and the Father too "makes Himself at home" in those who are walking with His Son (John 14:23). The Holy Spirit dwells in you to empower you (Zechariah 4:6), guide you (Philippians 2:13), and comfort you (2 Corinthians 1:3-7).
- The whole Church universal -- all believers presently alive, along with all those who ever have and ever will live -- will be part of the same eternal family forever, in perfect unity. We have each other in the Body of Christ.

---

#### 5. Our lives as Christians have meaning and importance

- While nothing in this world, nothing that is of this world, has any lasting meaning for the believer in Jesus Christ, this Christian life is of immense importance when it comes to "why we are here". We are here to glorify Jesus Christ.
- This is not a drill. This is not a game. We have no time to waste waiting or resting, no time for looking back (like Lot's wife did), no time for sitting back in satisfaction at all we have accomplished (truly, even the best of us has done so little compared to the perfect standard we are called to). We must instead press on towards the tape, keeping firm in our hearts the meaning and purpose behind our work in the truth.
