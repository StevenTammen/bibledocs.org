00:00 - guys so this time we are picking back up
00:03 - after our last discussion point being
00:06 - about how we are soldiers in
00:10 - the only conflict in this world that has
00:12 - ever truly mattered
00:13 - so we were talking about how the
00:16 - fight that we fight as christians has
00:19 - this eternal weight behind it
00:21 - we're on the the stage of the most
00:24 - important battle in fact the only
00:26 - important battle in all of history
00:28 - um it's the reason why we're here in
00:30 - existence is to fight this fight of
00:32 - salvation
00:33 - right to apply faith to the choices
00:35 - before us in the world and
00:37 - choose for god um to demonstrate that we
00:39 - really do trust him
00:40 - and this is in opposition to all of the
00:43 - all of the things that
00:45 - other people in life might make their
00:46 - battles to live and die on
00:48 - so politics or other false religions
00:52 - actually
00:52 - or any number of other things that
00:54 - people get up in arms about
00:56 - well none of those things matter
00:57 - compared to the battle that we fight
01:00 - here on the spiritual stage
01:02 - so with this being said this battle
01:05 - we're talking about the first thing
01:06 - we're going to talk about here the first
01:07 - topic
01:08 - is that the battlefield we face is first
01:11 - and foremost in our hearts
01:13 - so everything that we think and feel is
01:16 - important
01:17 - because when we fight
01:20 - within our hearts um that is
01:24 - what we face um so we face
01:28 - a fight within ourselves um and so you
01:31 - may have heard this phrase before you
01:32 - know
01:32 - the greatest enemy is within um
01:35 - when we fight the battle day-to-day some
01:38 - of the times
01:39 - we face external opposition and we're
01:42 - talking about
01:43 - christians being persecuted or facing
01:46 - discrimination
01:47 - from the world like john 15 tells us we
01:49 - will
01:50 - but a large part of our victory
01:52 - spiritually is one
01:54 - when we struggle with the desires and
01:58 - the temptation within us
01:59 - and you know so a good verse for this is
02:03 - galatians 5 17 that talks about how the
02:05 - flesh and the spirit are always at odds
02:07 - with each
02:08 - other so you know the desires of the
02:10 - spirit are against the flesh for these
02:12 - are opposed to each other
02:14 - um that is what we face as christians
02:16 - within us at any given point in time
02:19 - and so why is this battlefield in our
02:22 - hearts well we said therefore
02:24 - because it is everything we think and
02:25 - feel is important
02:27 - but and because this is true we also
02:29 - must take pains
02:30 - to not allow ourselves to become
02:32 - depressed or discouraged or distracted
02:34 - because we're fighting in ourselves
02:37 - if we throw in the towel of our own
02:40 - volition
02:42 - how are we ever going to recover if
02:44 - we're if the battle is only within us
02:46 - right so the only way that we can win is
02:49 - by focusing on the things above
02:51 - even as we fight out here below on earth
02:54 - um so this is
02:55 - in colossians talking about us sending
02:57 - setting our mind
02:59 - on the thing you know actually let me go
03:00 - click on this and get taken to the page
03:02 - we have it pulled up right if we have
03:04 - been raised up with christ
03:06 - as colossians chapter 3 verses 1 and
03:08 - following
03:09 - if you have been raised up with christ
03:11 - keep seeking the things above where
03:13 - christ is
03:14 - seated at the right hand of god set your
03:16 - mind on things above not on things that
03:18 - are on earth
03:18 - for you have died and your life is
03:20 - hidden with christ in god
03:22 - when christ whose our life is revealed
03:23 - then you will also be revealed with him
03:25 - in glory
03:27 - so this is the idea that we fight
03:30 - with our focus on the things above even
03:33 - as we're down here below in the trenches
03:34 - of the spiritual battlefield
03:36 - um and then also because
03:40 - this battle is in our hearts we need to
03:42 - always be encouraging ourselves
03:44 - to keep jesus christ and the cause for
03:46 - which we fight
03:48 - shining brightly in our hearts right to
03:50 - make it at the forefront of our minds
03:52 - um because just as
03:56 - just as moses by faith left egypt and
03:58 - that's the
03:59 - cross rough that ichthys pulls in here
04:01 - um
04:02 - moses by faith you know
04:05 - left the position he had as a prince of
04:07 - egypt throwing in his lot with the
04:09 - hebrew people
04:11 - right because he was keeping his eyes on
04:13 - the cause to which he was called
04:15 - right on you know jesus christ in the
04:18 - christophany of the burning bush
04:21 - right keeping keeping his eyes on what
04:24 - he's called to
04:25 - as a believer and of course moses's
04:28 - action had
04:29 - great physical effects on the nation of
04:31 - israel
04:32 - however moses made this decision within
04:35 - himself
04:36 - there wasn't external pressure for him
04:40 - he voluntarily gave up the position he
04:42 - had and sacrificed what he had
04:45 - based on the call of god um
04:48 - and this is why we're kind of i don't
04:51 - know if uh
04:52 - emphasizing is probably the right word
04:54 - here this is why we are emphasizing
04:56 - that the battlefield that we face as
04:57 - christians first and foremost
04:59 - is within us anyone have
05:03 - things to add to this
05:06 - so anyone else who wants to go first
05:08 - should go
05:11 - i don't want to hog the mic all the time
05:15 - okay um well i think this is a
05:18 - pretty obvious thing but at the same
05:21 - time it's a subtly difficult thing to
05:24 - grasp when
05:28 - when we consider how easy it is to fall
05:30 - into legalism
05:33 - then we can see how this is a big deal
05:37 - it's one of the things we need to
05:39 - remember
05:40 - in the chaos of war of spiritual warfare
05:45 - we have to remember it because
05:48 - sometimes the easier thing to not
05:50 - sometimes
05:52 - generally the easier thing to do
05:55 - create a bunch of rules and try to force
05:58 - ourselves to to follow
06:00 - a rigid system of
06:03 - outward behavior seems to solve the
06:06 - problem as long as we are doing this
06:08 - we're doing a b and c then we are
06:12 - doing what we ought to be doing we are
06:14 - fighting as we should be fighting
06:16 - but whereas our actions do matter the
06:20 - visible things we do the the audible
06:23 - things we say
06:25 - what can be seen of us these things do
06:27 - matter
06:29 - but they ought to come from a spring
06:31 - within in other words what is going on
06:33 - in our
06:34 - hearts is supposed to be
06:37 - the source of our actions we ought not
06:40 - to be hypo
06:41 - doing things that are not represent
06:43 - [Music]
06:44 - so um our job
06:48 - really is to make sure
06:52 - that we are aligning the way we think
06:56 - and feel about things and the feeling
06:59 - part
06:59 - is always hard but when you're learning
07:03 - to condition
07:04 - your hearts to follow the truth
07:08 - of course your feelings won't always
07:10 - come along as a matter of fact
07:12 - throughout our lives we will find that
07:14 - we want to keep fighting to keep our
07:16 - feelings in
07:17 - to keep them aligned with the truth
07:21 - it will be a never-ending battle until
07:24 - we are done
07:25 - with this life but still we will find
07:29 - that
07:30 - as we are yielding ourselves to the
07:33 - truth
07:33 - conforming ourselves to it even our
07:36 - emotions will come along
07:38 - that does happen so again
07:43 - this is important to keep in mind
07:45 - because of the danger
07:47 - of legalism because we can decide
07:50 - that as long as we're going through
07:52 - certain emotions
07:53 - everything is fine but that might
07:57 - just be the kind of arrogance or pride
08:00 - we
08:00 - will fall into that will destroy our
08:02 - spiritual progress
08:04 - if we're going to win in this fight we
08:06 - win first in our hearts
08:08 - we change the way this is actually how
08:11 - romans 12
08:13 - be renewed be transformed by the
08:16 - renewing of your mind
08:18 - we will be transformed when the inner
08:20 - man is renewed
08:22 - the thing inside is changed and it is
08:26 - only changed looking at the word of
08:27 - truth
08:28 - and imbibing it buying into what it
08:31 - committing ourselves to following
08:33 - through on it
08:35 - so yeah um
08:38 - okay the second point too is pretty
08:42 - critical i think
08:45 - it's it's another dimension to the whole
08:48 - um
08:48 - fighting vessel in the heart but i think
08:51 - this one
08:52 - is is in my experience the harder one
08:55 - for me anyway
08:56 - um especially because for people like me
09:00 - for me specific depression comes from
09:03 - failure
09:04 - when you fail even if you confess and
09:07 - all that the whole
09:08 - the thing is still you knew better
09:12 - you shouldn't have done what you did and
09:14 - then you get all caught up in that
09:17 - and it can compromise your ability to
09:21 - fight
09:22 - so um keeping a strong
09:26 - hold a tight hold
09:29 - on the battle of the heart making sure
09:31 - that we are holding on to the ground
09:33 - that we have won
09:35 - and making sure we're conquering more
09:37 - ground in our hearts is critical
09:40 - it's not just the smile we plaster on
09:43 - our face
09:44 - it has to be joy in our hearts now you
09:47 - it's a
09:48 - i think that's a good entry point when
09:50 - we are thinking about this battleground
09:52 - of the heart think about
09:54 - the fact that we the scripture tells us
09:56 - to rejoice always
09:57 - and the bible tells us the council's
09:59 - torture when we fall into diverse
10:01 - trials and stuff like this
10:04 - if that is the case how
10:08 - how do we win this battle of the hearts
10:12 - when inside we don't feel the joy
10:16 - we we we don't find anything to
10:19 - count as joy in the trials we're going
10:22 - through
10:23 - well here's the thing going through
10:27 - trial is staying
10:28 - it's called trials it's called
10:29 - tribulations for for good reason
10:32 - it's not supposed to be pleasant
10:35 - but here is one reason that you're told
10:37 - to counter joy
10:39 - that god deemed you worthy of going
10:41 - through those things
10:42 - that he is demonstrating his confidence
10:45 - in you your ability to actually
10:47 - beat what challenge you're faced with at
10:49 - this time
10:50 - i mean i personally have
10:53 - felt like i'm walking on clouds when
10:57 - professor robert or my fiance go
11:01 - i know you can do something that i'm not
11:04 - entirely sure i can do
11:06 - you know or they they express some
11:09 - confidence in me
11:11 - regarding something it kind of tells it
11:14 - there are times of course when that
11:15 - feels like it's a lot of pressure
11:17 - and then there are times when that is
11:18 - like well
11:21 - they must be seeing something that i
11:24 - should
11:24 - also be seeing so it's like they help me
11:28 - see
11:28 - a view they give me a view of myself
11:31 - that
11:32 - helps me to deal with a challenge now
11:35 - the same thing
11:36 - is how we should approach things with
11:38 - god if he
11:40 - decides to let us go through a
11:42 - difficulty it must be because
11:45 - he is confident that something in us is
11:47 - able to get to get through it
11:48 - that we can make it through it that's
11:51 - something to count joyful it should like
11:54 - make you you know feel like you're on
11:57 - cloud nine that the lord actually thinks
11:59 - you can't handle this that you
12:01 - you're up to the task it's a pretty high
12:03 - opinion for him to have of you
12:05 - right but here's the thing if you're not
12:08 - holding
12:09 - on or if you're not even aware that this
12:12 - is what the scriptures
12:13 - mean by the trials we pass through that
12:16 - means you don't have the truth in this
12:17 - case
12:18 - how are you going to have joy in your
12:20 - heart no
12:21 - no so i think a good point of divergence
12:25 - you know more than what we have on the
12:26 - slides here something that i think we
12:27 - should spend a few minutes talking about
12:29 - at least
12:30 - it's just hitting back this point that
12:32 - we've brought up on rejoicing always in
12:34 - our hearts right and this is really why
12:36 - we say the battles in our hearts because
12:37 - it's not just about dragging our feet so
12:40 - that we have faith until the end
12:41 - but as christians we're called to peace
12:43 - and joy always
12:46 - and in fact i know we've talked about
12:48 - this in the study
12:49 - right um way back up here peace and joy
12:52 - right look at this this section blast
12:54 - from the past
12:55 - you know um and in particular
12:59 - here's some verses i don't know if
13:00 - you've ever come back on these these are
13:02 - all the promises we have as christians
13:05 - all the things that are true regarding
13:06 - us as christians right
13:08 - so here let me just read these real
13:09 - quick we've been spiritually reborn
13:12 - forgiven our sins redeemed from sin
13:14 - and death reconciled to god adopted as
13:16 - children of god
13:17 - espoused to jesus christ wide enrolled
13:20 - as citizens in the new jerusalem
13:22 - named as god's heirs for an eternal
13:24 - inheritance justified by being given
13:26 - god's own righteousness
13:28 - sanctified in christ as being holy to
13:30 - god sealed under god's own guarantee of
13:32 - salvation by the pledge of the holy
13:34 - spirit
13:35 - under grace and his blessings and free
13:37 - from the curse of the law
13:38 - in union with christ and made one with
13:41 - the father and spirit
13:42 - given access to god as priests of jesus
13:44 - christ blessed with fellowship with the
13:46 - father
13:47 - the son and the holy spirit given
13:49 - spiritual gifts to serve the church and
13:50 - earn eternal rewards
13:52 - promised resurrection and promised a
13:54 - place in the new jerusalem forever
13:57 - so i'm bringing all these up because
14:00 - when someone asks you well how can we
14:02 - have peace and joy as christians
14:04 - right how can we keep our hearts
14:08 - centered
14:08 - where they should be you know if we say
14:10 - the battlefield that we fight is within
14:12 - our heart
14:12 - and the challenging difficult part of
14:15 - that
14:16 - is keeping our hearts focused where they
14:17 - ought to be well
14:19 - how can we live in this peace and joy
14:21 - that's why this section here is good
14:22 - that's right we're talking about peace
14:23 - and joy but counting your blessings
14:25 - right giving thanks for all that we have
14:27 - for all that god's already done for us
14:30 - thankfulness is a huge part of it
14:32 - um but i want to go ahead and actually
14:33 - read these verses here
14:35 - um we kind of touched on this topic of
14:37 - you know rejoicing always in our hearts
14:39 - right
14:39 - but here's first thessalonians chapter 5
14:42 - verses 16
14:43 - through 18 rejoice always pray without
14:46 - ceasing give thanks in all circumstances
14:49 - for this is the will of god in christ
14:50 - jesus right
14:52 - this is pretty unqualified it doesn't
14:55 - say
14:56 - it doesn't say oh rejoice only when
14:57 - things go well
14:59 - um this is the attitude that we're
15:01 - supposed to have in our hearts
15:02 - i'm kind of like we were talking about
15:04 - before um
15:05 - in this verse here right why why does it
15:09 - not matter
15:10 - what we feel or what our feelings might
15:13 - be pressuring us for because we know
15:14 - that god's working all things out
15:16 - according to the good of those who love
15:17 - him right um
15:19 - but so that verse is in first
15:21 - thessalonians we also have this passage
15:23 - in philippians chapter four
15:24 - so philippians 4 verses 4 through 8 or i
15:27 - guess
15:28 - probably don't need to go all the way
15:29 - through eight here on how about four
15:30 - through seven
15:31 - um picking up at verse four rejoice in
15:33 - the lord always
15:34 - and again i say rejoice let your
15:37 - moderation be known unto all men
15:39 - the lord is at hand be careful for
15:41 - nothing but in everything by prayer and
15:43 - supplication
15:44 - with thanksgiving let your requests be
15:46 - made known unto god
15:47 - and the peace of god which passeth all
15:50 - understanding shall keep your hearts and
15:51 - minds through christ jesus so
15:54 - we're touching here on the passages of
15:57 - peace and joy
15:58 - right so first thessalonians chapter 5
16:00 - tells us to give thanks in all
16:02 - circumstances
16:03 - right you rejoice always pray without
16:04 - ceasing philippians chapter 4
16:07 - in um
16:10 - you see verse 4 says rejoice in the lord
16:13 - always
16:15 - always again you know emphasis on at all
16:18 - times
16:18 - this is the perspective that it's so
16:20 - hard for us to keep as christians
16:22 - because our natural inclination when
16:24 - things go sideways in the world
16:26 - isn't peace and joy it's depression and
16:29 - anxiety
16:30 - and all of these other things that lay
16:33 - upon our hearts
16:34 - and that's why we always have to
16:36 - struggle within us to keep that
16:38 - spiritual perspective on um it's kind of
16:41 - like wrestling a bear
16:43 - so we're always going to have this
16:44 - impulse to
16:46 - to not want to go and constantly put up
16:48 - that fight in our hearts
16:50 - but we need to wrestle the bear we need
16:53 - to keep that perspective in mind
16:54 - thanks because that's how we get the
16:56 - peace and joy that we're called to as
16:58 - christians
16:59 - and i keep going um i just thought it
17:01 - was important you know we're talking
17:02 - here about
17:03 - the battlefield in our hearts and this
17:05 - is a huge part of it
17:06 - um it's more than just it's more than
17:09 - just maintaining faith right that's of
17:11 - course a big part of this for us
17:13 - as christians in this world but
17:15 - struggling with that perspective we're
17:17 - always supposed to overlay our
17:18 - circumstances and peace and joy
17:20 - um even though it's not explicitly
17:22 - mentioned here i think that is
17:23 - a large part of the battle in our hearts
17:27 - yeah um and i think this
17:30 - this last point really sums it all up
17:34 - um the battlefield that the battle
17:38 - really is to keep our eyes
17:42 - on the truth the whole war
17:45 - the war is about the truth that's what
17:48 - the war is about
17:50 - all of this stuff started because satan
17:52 - had an
17:53 - ambition which was founded on a lie
17:57 - he allowed himself to believe
18:01 - that it was possible for a creature to
18:03 - become
18:05 - like god in the sense of
18:08 - taking god's throne that was an
18:12 - impossibility but he let himself believe
18:15 - it
18:16 - and the attitude of a liar is
18:18 - essentially
18:19 - to say reality is not
18:23 - key i can remake
18:26 - reality any way i please
18:30 - that's the arrogance of life the truth
18:33 - is that god cannot
18:36 - have an equal among creatures
18:40 - god stands alone
18:43 - separate from the universe he made he
18:46 - deserves
18:47 - all the worship all the trust all the
18:50 - everything that can be given to a
18:53 - benevolent ruler
18:55 - that's what he deserves he does not
18:57 - deserve rebellion at our hands
18:59 - so the battle in our hearts
19:02 - is the battle for the truth and it is in
19:06 - our hearts
19:07 - that we must accept the truth
19:11 - so when we
19:14 - when we buy into this
19:17 - and insist on having
19:21 - all our thoughts and our feelings
19:24 - go along with the truth we'll find that
19:28 - we are
19:29 - actually fighting this battle as we
