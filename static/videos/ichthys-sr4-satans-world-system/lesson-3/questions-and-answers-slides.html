### Lesson 3 Questions and Answers:

#### On monks and monasticism as a false concept of what "sojourning in the world" should mean for us as Christians

---

#### Is complete separation from the world appropriate? Should we become monks?

So, the question might go, if we are sojourners in this hostile world -- if we should guard our hearts against the things here and take care to remain firm in our separation as strangers -- then is complete separation from the world a good idea? It seems plausible enough, on the surface. 

But the Biblical answer is no -- and quite a firm no at that.

---

#### The basic scriptural evidence against monasticism

It's actually rather simple. The rest of this slide is [a quotation from Ichthys](https://www.ichthys.com/mail-Culture-and-ChristianityVIII.htm#:~:text=We%20Christians,11%20NIV):

We Christians are not "of the world" (Jn.17:14) – but we are certainly "in the world", and even our dear Lord Jesus did not pray for us to be taken "out of the world" but that we might be "protected from the evil one" (Jn.17:15). Our role in this protection is to give ourselves over to "sanctification by truth" (Jn.17:17ff.), and to obey and follow that truth to the best of our ability through the guidance of the Holy Spirit [...] Our separation and sanctification from the world, moreover, is not one of running off to the mountains and practicing asceticism, but of seeking out the truth and fellowship with other believers who actually believe and practice the truth.

> **9** I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people -- **10** not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. **11** But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.
>
> 1st Corinthians 5:9-11, NIV

#### The basic scriptural evidence against monasticism

Consider again the passage from John 17:14ff. Direct quote from John 17:18: "As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world." If we are sent into the world by Christ, how then can we pull out of the world? How can you possibly read this verse as "'sent into the world' really means that Jesus is commanding us to pull out of the world"? I guess the Bible means whatever we want it to, huh?

Consider again the passage from 1 Corinthians 5:9-11. Paul's words make absolutely zero sense if believers (any believers at all) should pull out of the world completely. Verse 10 *directly* argues against the idea of that.

Consider also Matthew 5:13-16. How can we be salt and light as we are called to if we cloister ourselves off on a mountain and away from the world?

---

#### Are decisions here a matter of application -- what is right for one person may not be right for another?

Nope. Can you think of any way to make the verses we just discussed suddenly apply to some people, but not others? I can't.

So there is no "this is the right path for me even if it isn't the right path for you." Leaving the world in monastic retreat is always the wrong path, for everyone. Period.

---

#### What about the fact that lots of people chose this path throughout history?

Well, what about it? They were wrong. Numbers don't mean anything when weighed against the Word of God.

Most humans throughout history have chosen against God completely. That's an even more convincing argument from numbers. Should we buy that argument too?

---

#### Aren't many of these historical monastic people looked up to and respected by lots of Christians too?

Indeed, and this shows the spiritually immaturity of said "lots of Christians."

Humans are easily impressed by extreme outward behavior, but the thing is, none of that matters. That's not what God cares about. God cares about what is within our hearts -- and in particular, our attitude to the truth He has given us in the Bible.

---

#### Are monks at all praiseworthy, even to the slightest degree?

I suppose at least monks are zealous about something (cf. Paul before his conversion), which at least makes their approach better than the more-common lukewarm approach of not believing or standing up for much of anything at all.

Although since ascetic legalism usually goes hand-in-hand with monasticism, usually the zeal is directed towards putting on false airs while making others feel guilty unnecessarily, so don't get feeling too warm and fuzzy about their zeal.

Monks have not historically been some sort of unified monolith, and are not to this day. Some "flavors" of monasticism are much less problematic overall than others (in shades of less beating-you-over-the-head with legalism), although all the flavors share most of the problems.

---

#### Are monks at all praiseworthy, even to the slightest degree?

The spiritual status of monks should not be taken to be great and revered, even despite their PR and outward appearances.

After all, if in fact we are not supposed to completely pull away from the world, then they have made an enormous spiritual mistake, and are actively militating against the truth in how they live!

---

#### There is no "A for effort" in Christianity. Since we all have free will, only actual results matter

Monks don't even get brownie points for "trying to do the right thing." Actually, it is impossible for anyone to do the wrong thing unless they choose to do the wrong thing -- we all have free will. God leads all who are willing into the truth on all matters. So anyone holding onto lies is doing so -- even if at unconscious level -- because they are unwilling to accept the truth.

This is actually positionally true of all people (we should be careful not to give people who refuse to accept the truth too much credit -- even if they seem to be confused and hung up and seeking in good faith, the fact that they are unwilling to accept the truth shows spiritual hardness on their part), not just people holding onto monasticism in particular.

Compare Romans 1:18ff. According to the Bible, no unbeliever is truly unaware of God's existence, even if they do not consciously recall squashing the knowledge in their hearts, and hardening themselves to the truth.

---

#### Sidenote: we ourselves are not exempt from the principle

God takes each and every one of us just as far as we are willing to go. When red-hot believers come to adopt some new position in accordance with the truth, they have exercised their free will, and chosen to stop holding onto something that is false -- even if, in their opinion, they weren't so consciously holding onto the false thing.

Many people take offense at the notion that they are "willingly" believing false things with their free will, even as they seek after the truth earnestly. In fact, there is no problem or contradiction here. God does not immediately override our free will when we are saved to make us believe only proper things. No, quite to the contrary... arguably the whole reason why we are still here after salvation is to show God exactly how far we are willing to take our free will choices away from the lies and towards Him.

---

#### Why are you being so harsh towards monks and monasticism? Couldn't you just make the point and move on?

We should be harsher towards things that are proportionally more dangerous spiritually.

Most Christians with even a little bit of Biblical knowledge can spot obvious false teaching, something nonsensical like "Jesus had a child with Mary Magdalene, and I'm the descendent of this child. Therefore, give me money." What is much scarier is when most of the church visible enthusiastically buys into some area of false teaching, like here.

We need to be extra-stark in our presentation of such issues to drive home the fact that these things ***are false teaching***. In spiritual terms -- the only terms that truly matter -- monasticism is not actually all that removed from the rubbish example I quoted: both are opposed to God's truth, set on fire from hell. But while hardly anyone would fall for the rubbish example, lots of people fall for monasticism (or at least support practitioners of it).

---

#### Why are you being so harsh? Couldn't you just make the point and move on?

How then ought we to treat it? We should treat it as it truly is, without backing down in the slightest. Even and perhaps especially if that means we incur the ire of the rest of the Christian world.

The truth is worth taking a stand for.

---

#### So we shouldn't care about separating ourselves from the world?

Not at all! Let's not trap ourselves in a false dichotomy. Our lesson this week was about how we our sojourners in the world -- we are in it, but not of it.

Thus, we should in no way accept the world with both arms wide open, but instead hold it at arms' length as if it were a venomous snake. The point is that we are called to do this without separating ourselves completely from the threat, which is why the Christian life requires a great deal of spiritual maturity and discernment to navigate successfully.

This is why spiritual growth is so important!

#### Ichthys on Monks and monasticism

Here are a collection of quotes from Ichthys on these subjects, and direct links to them (emphasis mine, for the most part):

[Quote 1](https://ichthys.com/6A-Peripateo.htm#:~:text=neither%20shunning%20it%20like%20monks%20who%20hide%20away%20from%20the%20world%20to%20avoid%20its%20potential%20entanglements) - on our relationship to the world

> If we "seek first the kingdom" (Matt.6:33), that is, put the Lord and His truth in first place in our hearts, everything else in this world will fall into place.  But if we allow our priorities to be distorted, everything else will suffer spiritually.  Keeping the correct priorities requires a bold, faith-filled approach, one that walks straight ahead through this temporary world, **neither shunning it like monks who hide away from the world to avoid its potential entanglements**, nor compromising with the world in allowing what is really important – the truth, learning it, living it, and helping others to do the same – to drop out of first place in our hearts (Rev.2:4).

#### Ichthys on monks and monasticism

[Quote 2](https://ichthys.com/mail-Jewelry.htm#:~:text=In%20times,been%20called.) - on our relationship to the world

> In times past there have been many groups who have pursued asceticism and various forms of withdrawal from the world. But clearly **our Lord meant us to stay in the world** (Jn.17:15), and Paul makes it very clear that **truly escaping the world is impossible** (1Cor.5:10). So as Christians we are in the world, but we are not of the world. Indeed, on the one hand, if God didn't want us to have any part of the world whatsoever anymore, He would bring us home to be with Him immediately; on the other hand, the only way that we can let our light shine into the darkness of this world is to continue to walk in it, but to walk in it as true disciples of Jesus Christ whom we love, not as friends of this world (which we do not love: 1Jn.2:15-17; cf. Jas.4:4). So **the biblical way to separate from the world is to put Jesus first in our lives, dedicate ourselves to learning and believing the Bible, putting that truth to work in our lives, and helping others to do the same through the spiritual gifts and ministries that God has entrusted to us**. This will require, of course, a process of spiritual growth and production on the one hand, and a process of sanctification on the other. Both processes are absolutely necessary to live full and effective lives for our Lord and to maximize the witness of life and works to which we have been called.

#### Ichthys on Monks and monasticism

[Quote 3](https://ichthys.com/mail-gospel-questions15.htm#:~:text=i%20doubt%20there%20is%20a%20single%20monk%20in%20the%20history%20of%20the%20world%20who%20is%20going%20to%20be%20highly%20rewarded%20%E2%80%93%20and%20i%20doubt%20the%20salvation%20of%20many) - On the spiritual state of monks

> I doubt there is a single monk in the history of the world who is going to be highly rewarded – and I doubt the salvation of many.

[Quote 4](https://ichthys.com/mail-Culture-and-Christianity11.htm#:~:text=but%20as%20far%20as%20%22total%20commitment%22%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20only%20people%20in%20the%20history%20of%20the%20church%20who%20have%20ever%20managed%20anything%20like%20that%20are%20monks%20%E2%80%93%20and%20they%20ended%20spending%20all%20their%20time%20brewing%20beer%2C%20making%20cheese%2C%20and%20wasting%20the%20extra%20time%20they%20had%20in%20senseless%20and%20meaningless%20ritual.) - on historical realities perhaps being different from how people imagine monastic retreat

> But as far as "total commitment" is concerned, the only people in the history of the Church who have ever managed anything like that are monks – and they ended spending all their time brewing beer, making cheese, and wasting the extra time they had in senseless and meaningless ritual.

[Quote 5](https://www.ichthys.com/mail-Bible-InterpretationIV.htm#:~:text=as%20we%20both%20agree%2C%20there%20is%20no%20possibility%20of%20absolute%20separation%20from%20the%20secular%20in%20this%20corrupt%20world%20without%20%22going%20out%20of%20the%20world%22%20%281cor.5%3A9-10%29.%20but%20if%20the%20lord%20opens%20a%20path%20for%20us%20through%20the%20sea%2C%20we%20will%20rejoice%20and%20be%20glad%20in%20it.) - on the impossibility of completely separating from the world as Christians

> As we both agree, there is no possibility of absolute separation from the secular in this corrupt world without "going out of the world" (1Cor.5:9-10). But if the Lord opens a path for us through the sea, we will rejoice and be glad in it.
