#### Introduction: It is in Satan's best interests to divert man's attention away from mortality, and unbelieving man is all too happy to cooperate in this matter

While Satan uses a variety of techniques to control the human race, it is fair to say that to the extent life's futility motivates mankind to seek eternal solutions to the hopelessness of temporal life, to that extent it is clearly in the devil's interest to direct humanity's activities into other channels (as best he can).

And, indeed, much human effort over the millennia has been directed toward solving, mitigating or flat out denying the essential truth of the meaninglessness of life apart from God (see [section IV](https://ichthys.com/SR4%28SWS%29.htm#IV.%20Satan's%20World-System:%20Tactical%20Doctrine) in this present study of SR4).

Mankind has made a science of discovering interesting amusements and diversions to try and take the sting out of life... in vain. For the sin we have inherited from Adam guarantees that the sting of death will continue to loom large for all who ever choose to take a sober, realistic look at the true dynamics of life (1 Corinthians 15:54-57).

#### Introduction: It is in Satan's best interests to divert man's attention away from mortality, and unbelieving man is all too happy to cooperate in this matter

In light of the ultimate futility of life, both taken as a whole and viewed in terms of the pointlessness of effort beyond the bare necessity of survival, it is understandable (rational, even -- at least in a way) that mankind has historically devoted itself to the principle of diversion, a principle that explains almost all human behavior of a non-spiritual nature:

> Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.  
> 1 Corinthians 15:32b

The secular conclusion above (presented by Paul as a perfectly logical *modus operandi* in the absence of any hope of eternal life) is a succinct way of stating the principle. If death be inevitable, and if life be an essentially dull and pointless continuum of toil and pain, what better way to "get through" than to devote oneself to diversions (of one sort or another).

Work and accomplishment can serve effectively in this capacity as well. Anything that distracts from the overall vanity of life fulfills the diversion principle.

#### There are many potential means by which humans seek to distract themselves and live in denial, chasing after ever-elusive happiness. Who can say if one is more pointless than another?

Between birth and death, we human beings have nothing but time, time which must be served on this earth under the Genesis curse. We fill the time with work, with relationships, and with various pleasures and pursuits. We fill the time, we waste the time, we strive desperately not to be at loose ends with our time, lest the realization of life's vanity dawn and bear heavily down upon us.

To the extent that the effort produced by our time-filling, time-wasting activities is directed at all, it is inevitably directed toward the impossible goal of making ourselves happy (whether directly or indirectly).

Whether a man toils a lifetime in the depths of the earth searching for treasure, or spends his days at the corner pub, happiness is the ultimate objective, and who can say which man is the greater fool? In the latter case, happiness stops almost instantaneously with "last call"; in the former, great success will only bring an end to the diversion of toil and bring on the realization that riches do not produce happiness (dispelling the illusion that motivated the distracting toil in the first place).

#### But it's far from just humanity getting itself into trouble. This world, run by Satan, very much stacks the cards against the proper spiritual attitude

The world, especially the modern, western world, is full of distractions that have the potential of becoming obstacles to our spiritual progress -- idols, in effect -- things that may come to harm our relationship with God.

Satan has incorporated into his system of world rulership as many material distractions as possible. Affluence, the increase and spread of wealth, communication, and technology are factors which, from one point of view, are very beneficial to the devil's control of mankind.

For one thing, fear is a major element in Satan's manipulation of humanity, and to the extent that men enjoy and rely on such things for their happiness and security, to that degree the fear of losing them produces a sort of bondage which the devil is quick to exploit (cf. Hebrews 2:14-15 for the principle).

#### Seeking to avoid vanity by chasing after happiness, is, ironically, a sure way to come face to face with it

Do we not enjoy our pleasures? Certainly we do. Much of human ingenuity since Man's expulsion from the garden has been devoted to the science of amusement. And in our modern western world of high technology and super-abundance, pleasures and diversions are available on a scale never imagined millennia ago... and most modern people do not at all hold back in seeking to indulge.

Never before has there been so much prosperity, yet never before has there been so much depression. The more we human beings have pursued happiness, the more unhappy we have become. The harder we have toiled for it, the more easily it has eluded us. The less pressing the necessities of life have become, the more despondent we have become.

Thus it is that the things people think will make them happy instead contribute to their despondency. This too is vanity.

#### Why? Because work is the ultimate distraction given to us by God, so if we severely reduce that distraction, what do we have to insulate us from life's futility?

The toil of work, the Genesis curse, is the one thing that is capable of effectively distracting us from the grinding realization that life is pointless. Work alone (along with the taking in of sustenance which work makes possible) is the one truly necessary element in life, and so provides a satisfying distraction unmatched by all other pursuits of happiness:

> Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given him -- for this is his lot. Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy (lit. eat) them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work -- this is a gift of God. He seldom reflects on the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness of heart.  
> Ecclesiastes 5:18-21, NIV

The distraction of work -- the "curse" as we call it -- is not something that is perfectly satisfying, but God did put it upon the shoulders of mankind for our own collective good.

---

#### Even if work is an effective distraction, it doesn't stop material existence from being completely pointless

Nevertheless, as the last verse above indicates, work too is essentially a diversion. Challenging, time-consuming, satisfying, work distracts the mind from reflection about the futility of life. The days pass productively (if pointlessly) so that the issue of vanity and futility never weighs heavily upon the heart.

Without God then, the best mankind can hope for during these meaningless days under the sun is a challenging profession that occupies the energies, provides creature comforts, and a state of mind oblivious to the logic of mortality. The best that one can hope for, therefore, is to be like the animals, who pursue and enjoy sustenance and creature comforts, without being conscious of the approach of death:

> I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless. All go to the same place; all come from dust and to dust all return. Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?" So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?  
> Ecclesiastes 3:18-22, NIV

#### This material world with all of its distractions and diversions is nothing but shadows and illusion

Today we have covered the idea of distraction and diversion as tools in Satan's tool-belt. Remember that this world, this *kosmos* under the rule of Satan, is nothing but shadows projected on the wall in front of us. To use the imagery of Plato's *Allegory of the Cave*, we are chained in place in the darkness, forced to look at these illusions. Satan *wants* us to to be content with the shadows on the wall. He doesn't want us breaking free from our shackles and walking into the true light, becoming then able to recognize the shadows for what they are.

Shadows, no matter how pretty, are still just shadows, and we must never forget that. Most of humanity has gone mad, proclaiming that the shadowy illusions are reality. But if we hold out against the temptation and desire we feel -- against the siren song of the illusion -- then we will eventually be able to critique it, and break free from its sway over us. The truth will set us free.

This is why we must walk a different path here, spurning the endless flood of dissipation that unbelievers busy themselves with in an attempt to pretend that they won't die and face a perfect God. For us as Christians, distractions and diversions are nothing more than impediments to our spiritual growth. And since our continued growth is the only reason why God leaves us here after salvation...

Important stuff, eh?
