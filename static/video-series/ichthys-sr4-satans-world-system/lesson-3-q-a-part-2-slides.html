#### The monasticism I argued against is defined by complete separation from the world

Last video, I argued quite strongly against monasticism. Upon some reflection, I realized that I never spent much time defining the term. Even though I do not believe anything was particularly unclear since essentially all my comments revolved around the improper practice of complete separation from the world (thereby running afoul of John 17:14ff., 1 Corinthians 5:9-11, and Matthew 5:13-16), to head off any accusations of straw-manning and ensure nothing is unclear or ambiguous, I feel it is not a poor idea to make a few additional comments.

First, a proper definition:

> *Monasticism*: A life path revolving around separation from the world rather than living in the world. Characterized by complete physical withdrawal from the world, and also marked asceticism, to draw an even more total boundary of separation.

As a generalization, the twin ideas of physical withdrawal and radical asceticism are the things that monks and nuns pursue to completely separate from the world.

---

#### Avoiding legalism: things that may look somewhat like monasticism, but in reality do not have the same issues

The reason why the preceding presentation was as polemical as it was is because the vast majority of monastic practice is *entirely* about separation from the world. That is the essential point in the eyes  of most monastic orders... which is why we can paint such practice as misguided in broad strokes.

So why even say more? Well, because we don't want to fall into legalism by outlawing some straw man of "monasticism" and throwing the proverbial baby out with the prodigious bathwater.

One example that comes to mind is communities of only women (perhaps especially historically). Throughout most times and places in history, widows were exceptionally vulnerable. It was not uncommon for groups of them (and also younger women who faced various other circumstances) to band together in a number of different ways, including living together with one another. It would be *very problematic* for us to outlaw this practice "because monasticism is misguided." That right there is called legalism.

In this example, such groups do *not* have as their primary purpose withdrawing from the world, and that is the reason why they are fine while most monastic orders of nuns are not. Even if the two look similar on the surface.

#### Avoiding legalism: things that may look somewhat like monasticism, but in reality do not have the same issues

To generalize things, there are not any inherent issues with Christian communities of celibate men and women (if said people have properly found conviction on this matter through the correct spiritual channels, rather than legalism), as long as said communities are not aggressively pursuing physical withdrawal from the world and radical asceticism in an attempt to completely separate from the world, with this complete separation from the world as their *raison d'Ãªtre*, their reason for existing.

---

#### On the idea of application continuums

Something also not captured in our previous discussion of monasticism was the idea of application continuums. Some examples of why bringing up the idea of continuums in application is worth considering:

- Some people (farmers, for example) may find it beneficial to live on a larger quantity of land (putting them further away from the rest of the world), perhaps just with their family. Is this problematic physical separation?
- Some people may find it beneficial to practice strict self-discipline in various matters, perhaps pertaining to diet, exercise, and general time expenditure. Is this problematic asceticism?

In short, what degree of separation from the world is to be considered "monasticism" (and therefore to be avoided), and what degree of separation falls within the acceptable range of individual application (which is permissible, and perhaps even to be favored)? I'm willing to assent to the proposition that these things vary by time, place, and culture... but then that makes these things kind of hard to pin down definitively, does it not?

---

#### How to make determinations? Should we even make determinations?

To a very large extent, what others do is between them and God -- we are not at all supposed to be busybodies. At the same time, because the Bible is plenty clear about the fact that we are supposed to actually be in the world (albeit as strangers and sojourners rather than true citizens), then we shouldn't be too shy about giving gentle reminders about this truth if it ever seems prudent to do so.

I would say perhaps the best rule of thumb is to see if "withdrawing from the world" is held up as the primary reason for any particular choice or behavior. If it is not, then things are probably none of our business. For example:

- While introverted people may not spend nearly as much time out among others ("in the world"), it is not because they are actively trying to withdraw from the world, but just because of personality.
- Similarly, many people may find that it is easier for them to go completely cold turkey with respect to TV and other media than it is for them to have to constantly pick and choose to avoid sinful or simply unproductive influences -- not because they are trying to completely shun the world in self-righteous asceticism, but just because it makes good practical sense for them specifically.

One could go on. The main point to make is that any "separation from the world" coming from these things is not being pursued as an end unto itself... unlike with organized monasticism.

#### Why spend so much time focusing on the darkness of the world?

We've now talked at very great length about the topic of monasticism (= the idea of complete separation from the world), as it is a natural discussion topic to bring up when covering the responsibility we have as Christians to live only as sojourners (rather than full citizens) in this present world. However, there is another question I also wish to address, and that is why we spent as much time as we did in the lesson emphasizing the brokenness and darkness of the world.

To put the matter succinctly, why should we ever think of such unpleasant things as the list given in the lesson (war, genocide, rape, slavery, human trafficking, child abuse)? Why not only think about the joy we have in Christ, and the blessed fellowship we have with one another?

---

#### Why spend so much time focusing on the darkness of the world?

Why emphasize the darkness and evil of this world, even if doing so is unpleasant? Well, because people seem to forget that this world is irredeemably dark and evil all the time. For example:

People get upset and outraged when a mockery is made of Justice and Truth. But why in the world should we expect justice in Satan's domain? Jesus Christ, the Prince of the Universe, the perfect Son of God without sin or blemish, was beaten and mocked and crucified upon a cross, even though Pilate himself knew Him to be innocent. What justice? This world has never had it, and never will have it until Jesus returns with a sword to set things right.

People also waste their entire lives trying to fix the world through politics, but this world will always remain in darkness until Christ returns. Global peace will never materialize. Poverty and inequality will never be eradicated. You cannot in the slightest cast out supernatural spiritual darkness with democracy, or whatever else it may be that people hold up as a secular solution to the present ills of the world. Until the Millennium when everything is under the perfect rule of Christ, this world will stay completely broken.

---

#### Why spend so much time focusing on the darkness of the world?

If not up in arms regarding the previous things (which at least properly recognize that the present world has serious issues), people might even somehow convince themselves that the world is a pretty great place. Most people do not have anywhere near enough prosperity to be able to successfully stick their heads in the sand in this way (it is hard to think something like this when you and your children are starving to death, for example), but some Western folks of recent decades are uniquely blessed (or cursed, depending on how you look at it) to be able to delude themselves so. At which point they lack any impetus to avoid friendship with the world they so enjoy, even though such friendship will completely hamstring their spiritual growth.

We are not being cynical or pessimistic here, despite what some may say against us. This is reality, unpleasant as it may be.

---

#### We avoid despair by looking at this life through eyes of faith

If we are beaten and abused and even put to death unjustly -- without any guaranteed recompense in this life -- why shouldn't we fall into bottomless despair? If there is no real solution until Christ returns, then until then, aren't we all basically doomed?

Well, we would be if this life were all that there is. But we know that God sees our affliction. He saw it before the establishment of the universe. Not a single thing happens that was not foreknown by God in eternity past, and foreordained in His perfect plan for the ages. And when we find ourselves on the other side, all the blows we faced in this life will manifest as badges of honor that we will carry with us for all eternity. What then is this temporary affliction compared to the weight of eternal glory (cf. 2 Corinthians 4:17)?

On top of all this, it is all the more important that we train ourselves to properly appreciate the truth of these matters, given that the time is coming when the present darkness of the world will be made to look like child's play. Once the restraining influence of the Holy Spirit is removed, this already evil world will take a serious turn for the worse, and we believers will bear the brunt of its wrath in the Antichrist's Great Persecution (as prophesied in Revelation). If we aren't already in the habit of looking at life through eyes of faith, the coming torture and martyrdom may prove to be a fatal blow to our faith.

*This* is why we ought to take care to properly consider the darkness of the world -- not fixating on it, but also not downplaying it in the slightest.
