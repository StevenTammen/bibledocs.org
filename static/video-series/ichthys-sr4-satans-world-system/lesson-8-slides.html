### Lesson 8: Believers should expect persecution and hardship not affluence and absence of problems

#### Reorienting ourselves for a moment

Recall, for a moment, where we are in this study of SR4. The wider study is focused on Satan's world system (his framework of lies and deceit, set up in order to lead humans away from God's truth), and we are in a large section right now dealing with the vanity of life (in the context of us as strangers and sojourners in this world hostile to believers). In particular, we made the points that:

1. We can't control the outcome of events in this life no matter our effort. We may try the hardest out of all people and still end up with nothing.
2. But even if we do gain something, we have no power to safeguard it against loss in this life.
3. And, moreover, even we manage to gain something and hold onto it for our whole lives, death will still make a mockery of us, as we can take nothing with us, and no one will truly remember us once we are gone.

Last week we were going over false assumptions about wealth, and the sort of spiritual complacency that it can breed.

---

#### Reorienting ourselves for a moment

With respect to the wider study's focus, Satan tries very hard to get people to buy into these false views about wealth. These lies are part of his wider system of deception that has as its main purpose misleading and distracting us from God's truth, the one thing in this world that we are here for as Christians -- to learn learn it, believe it, apply it, and help others do likewise.

With respect to the narrower section's focus, these observations about wealth should strengthen our sojourner mentality, our need to avoid buying into the lies of this corrupt world. Because if we do not -- if we instead get attached to worldly wealth like Satan says we should -- we will only stare the futility of life in the face, and die at the end of it all with the horrifying realization that everything we strived for was dust, that all our life was vanity with no lasting eternal consequence. (Unlike everything we do spiritually).

#### Transition: So if the prosperity gospel is rubbish, what should we as believers expect in this life?

While we covered quite a bit of ground with regards to wealth last week (including how possession of it is no guarantee of doing well spiritually on our part, and how the complacency it breeds is very much a symptom of Laodicea), one of the primary points we made was that the prosperity gospel is a load of rubbish. That is, that the idea that God will necessarily bless us materially for our faith is categorically false.

The question natural to ask then is what we should expect instead. In this world where the material is shot through with futility and only the spiritual is of true consequence, what will God send our way as believers?

The answer is one that most people don't want to hear. Many people can and do stick their heads in the sand and pretend things work differently, that the Bible doesn't teach what it does, that reality is not so.

What is this truth that people run and hide from? It is the fact that rather than material blessing and prosperity, God promises Christians lives of hardship and persecution. Rather than comfort, we are to expect deprivation. Not because God wants us to be miserable (in fact, He calls us to peace and joy -- and with some spiritual perspective concerning what Christ has already done for us on the cross, this should not be impossible for us), but because suffering builds our faith and helps us grow spiritually, the only things that truly matter in this life.

#### Believers should expect persecution and hardship not affluence and absence of problems

Untroubled lives of ease in the midst of abundance are neither the norm nor the objective of the Christian life. The closer we walk with God, the more we can expect that walk to be opposed by Satan and his angels:

> Indeed, all who are willing to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.  
> 2 Timothy 3:12, translation from Ichthys

Satanic opposition, then, should be expected by growing believers. Even when the advancing believer finds himself in the midst of material prosperity, it should not be assumed that the devil will allow that person's Christian walk to go unchallenged:

> Jesus said, "In truth, I tell you, there is no one who has left behind a house or brothers or sisters or a mother or a father or children or fields for My sake and for the sake of the gospel who will not receive a hundred-fold more in this present time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children -- ***with persecutions*** -- and in the age to come, eternal life."  
> Mark 10:29-30, translation from Ichthys

#### Believers should expect persecution and hardship not affluence and absence of problems

Thus, Christian maturity and continued spiritual progress may or may not be accompanied by affluence (although the Mark 10 passage just referenced refers to the "affluence" of being part of Christ's Church), but they will *certainly* be accompanied by trials and tribulations:

> Beloved, don't be amazed at the fiery ordeal of testing you are now undergoing, as if something out of the ordinary were happening to you. But to the degree that you are [truly] participating in Christ's sufferings, be joyful about it, so that at His glorious revelation, you may also rejoice with great gladness.  
> 1 Peter 4:12-13, translation from Ichthys

---

#### Opposition from the world to our spiritual progress is therefore the rule, not the exception

Opposition from the world to our spiritual progress is therefore the rule, not the exception, and it is largely through our successful response to such tests that we come to appreciate the truth of the divine point of view about the world -- that its rewards (and so also their loss or absence) are of small consequence in comparison to the rewards of eternity, blessings that will never fade and will never be taken away:

> Brothers, when you are being beset with all manner of trials, take pains to be joyful. For you should keep in mind that this testing of your faith develops perseverance. So let your perseverance develop fully, that you may become fully mature and entitled to a full reward, having been found lacking in no respect.  
> James 1:2-4, translation from Ichthys

#### This is why the absence of wealth should mean nothing to us

Thus material prosperity in this present world is ultimately of little true account to those who have chosen to follow Jesus Christ. For in our trials and tribulations, whether we have material abundance or no, we have chosen to put our Master's priorities first; we have chosen God and His Son over the material prosperity which this world proclaims as its god:

> No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or cling to the one and despise the other. No one can serve God and Mammon.  
> Matthew 6:24, translation from Ichthys

#### This is why the absence of wealth should mean nothing to us

If we can properly keep these truths firmly fixed in our minds, we will sidestep one of Satan's most powerful and successful campaigns of spiritual falsehood, a campaign that has ensnared most people in the world (especially those in affluent countries). In this way -- if we esteem God and His truth over the ephemeral riches of this world that are already passing away -- then we will be well on our way to avoiding the vanity and the futility that otherwise plague human existence like an unwanted shadow, replacing them instead with spiritual meaning and and fulfillment.

In the final accounting of things, it may seem that we as Christians have lost things in this trade, but in truth what have we lost in comparison to the blessed eternal gain that God promises us? So let us resolve to square our shoulders and daily pick up our crosses rather than having a bad attitude about these things. For only by following this path can we truly flourish spiritually, and achieve all that God wants for us.
