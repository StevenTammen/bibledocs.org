#### We will be talking about the pursuit of happiness in great depth, but the principle of ever-rushing to fill the void is truly a general one

If there is one thing most modern humans have in common, it is a complete and utter intolerance for not having anything to do. God forbid we ever have to think deeply.

From the moment people get out of bed in the morning to the moment their heads hit the pillow at night, seldom is a single minute spared to think deeply and contemplate anything meaningful. This is true of all people to an extent and lukewarm believers to a higher degree, but is seen most especially with unbelievers who do not recognize any sort of deeper dimension in existence.

More than ever before, we humans seek to be entertained and engaged all our waking hours. Buoyed by recent technological innovation, what was not possible in the past is now mainstream and even expected. You are seen as the strange one if you too do not immediately rush headlong into the same flood of dissipation (compare 1 Peter 4:4).

#### Serious thought and sober reflection are very much on the decline

Rather than pondering human mortality, the frailty of security in the material world, the smallness of human achievement in light of the vastness of the universe, how much we owe God -- who sent His one and only Son to take the inestimable penalty for our sins upon His own shoulders -- or other such things, people may instead busy themselves with social media or playing pointless games on their phones.

Technology itself is not evil. It is neutral. The same things that allow for global intercommunication between Christians also allow for a heretofore never-before-seen addictive waste of time in online pursuits.

With a pocket-sized bundle of distraction now always on our person, it is not unfair to say that today's humans, *homo technologicus*, have largely forgotten what it is like to live without constant entertainment and media consumption before our eyeballs 24/7.

#### People don't even need to buy into myth-happiness to fill the void left by the truth with rubbish

It is somewhat horrifying to contemplate that very many people don't even get tripped up spiritually by the enticing siren song of myth-happiness, a striving after a somehow ever-future blissful existence. At least one can see what would make time expenditure there seem worth it, misguided though it may be. No, many people don't even go so far as to chase after something that would be somewhat worthy as a goal were it ever realistically attainable, but instead settle for something that upon even a cursory inspection is worth nothing at all.

To use a physical analogy, you might understand why people would fight and die over a great treasure. But when people fight and die over a worthless bundle of rags, the correct response is pained existential horror.

So too with every manner of rubbish that people put on the throne in their hearts in place of the truth. In the past, Esau traded his birthright as the firstborn for a mess of pottage. Today, people exchange the glory of the incorruptible God (Romans 1:23) for idols of mindless entertainment. For sitcoms, trashy novels, and celebrities squabbling on Twitter.

This fact should motivate us in evangelism. People don't even know the terrible trade they are making, how much more meaningful their lives could be.

#### Why bring all this up?

As a first point, it is important for believers to understand that the vast majority of everything that is done under the sun each day is existentially meaningless, a striving to fill the void left by rejection of the truth with anything -- even garbage -- so as to avoid the inescapable calculus of human existence: that we are sinful; that we will all face death; that we will be judged by a perfect God. Creation sings of such.

As Christians, we *should* scorn the substitutes for the truth (the garbage that comes to occupy the void) rather than viewing these substitutes less negatively. *Everything* that isn't the truth should get our warning bells ringing. Perhaps especially when everyone else says things are not so.

---

#### Why bring all this up?

But even more than simply recognizing the folly of unbelievers' pastimes, we should also jealously guard against hypocrisy in these matters. People might scoff at the irrationality of chasing after the things unbelievers do ("I'd never delude myself in the matter of __________!") while still at the same time wasting hours every day on things that are objectively inconsequential and unimportant.

Consider the fact that most people constantly complain about not having enough time to read their Bibles (or pray, or whatever else). They will say this with a straight face, while at the same time watching Netflix for 5 hours a day and spending another 4 hours after that on social media. No time, huh?

All of us -- myself included, and everyone I have ever and ever will meet -- will still be imperfect in this. We all waste time we shouldn't. But there is a big difference between shaking your head and resolving to do better next time and going about your day convinced that you honestly have no time for God when in reality it is because you are unwilling to give up the throne in your heart. Rationalization and self-delusion are truly terrifying things to behold.

#### Conclusions from our somewhat dreary discussion today

These matters are not the most fun to discuss. They call us out right alongside unbelievers. It is most certainly uncomfortable.

But the truth of the matter is that any space in our hearts not occupied by the truth will inevitably come to be occupied by something else -- idols. That was the message of our lesson this week: that where there is a void or vacuum, something will always come to fill it.

What we should get from all this, first and foremost, is that we need to take the utmost pains to be red hot and have the entirety of our hearts filled with the truth, so that there is nothing that Satan can exploit as a weakness. Only by a forward path of positive spiritual growth can we avoid letting weeds sneak in alongside the plant of our faith.
