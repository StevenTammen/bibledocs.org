#### False assumptions about prosperity, affluence, and material wealth are spiritually harmful

Ironically, believers have a tendency to do better spiritually in times of severe testing than in times of ease and plenty (cf. Deuteronomy 8:10-20). The parable of the sower (Matthew 13; Mark 4; Luke 8) speaks of weeds that can choke the plant of our faith, and in this vein, one weed which can be particularly dangerous to the Christian perspective is the prosperity weed. In these last days it is especially important for Christians to avoid a pair of assumptions which are equally dangerous:

1. That affluence is *necessarily* a sign that God is blessing us for being spiritually advanced.
2. That the result of spiritual growth and a prosperous relationship with God is *necessarily* material wealth.

---

#### 1. The presence of wealth doesn't necessarily mean we are doing well spiritually

Many people believe that affluence is *necessarily* a sign that God is blessing us, and therefore, if we are wealthy, that we must be doing just fine in our spiritual lives.

God does provide material blessings, occasionally of an exceptional nature. He did bless Abraham and David with affluence, for example, though John the Baptist and our Lord certainly did not live lives of material luxury.

It is well to consider that in the history of the world, many unbelievers have experienced exceptional material wealth. It would be a mistake, therefore, to assume that affluence is any indication of spiritual maturity.

To make but one further point on this subject, we who are blessed to live in the United States of America (and consequently enjoy a higher material standard of living than most of the rest of the world) are not automatically "better" Christians than our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world where life is harder in this respect.

---

#### 2. The prosperity gospel is a load of rubbish

Many people also believe that the result of spiritual growth and a prosperous relationship with God is *necessarily* material wealth (i.e., the "prosperity gospel").

In fact, the opposite effect is certainly not without precedent, that is, the spiritually mature encountering greater testing on this score (e.g., consider Job's trials, or Elijah's privations).

To continue to grow our faith, in fact, as we advance, God sends upon us progressively more and more difficult tests. Since more mature believers have more faith, it takes more to get them out of their comfort zone, to provide the stimulus necessary to grow their faith even more. For this reason, the more we grow as Christians, the harder tests we can expect -- not because God punishes positive spiritual growth with hardship, but because as we develop our faith muscle, God gives us ever greater opportunity to exercise it and bring glory to Him (and eternal rewards to us).

We are not specially exempt from material want in this escalating tempering of our faith in the fiery furnace of life, and that is the main point to take away here.

#### Laodicea and the conflation of wealth and spiritual success

Morbid over-emphasis on material prosperity has always been an occupational hazard of the human race in general, and the closer we come to the end of history, the more we can expect this issue to increase as a threat to Christian spiritual growth. During this last era of the Church, the Laodicean era, there is destined to be an ever increasing tendency toward equating wealth and affluence with spiritual success (Revelation 3:14-22).

God is the source of all our blessing, material prosperity included. But the false assumption of spiritual maturity and spiritual safety based solely upon material possessions is extremely dangerous. This is true for many reasons, not the least of which is an all too natural tendency to become complacent in the Christian walk, assuming spiritual maturity on the basis of material prosperity.

#### Laodicea and the conflation of wealth and spiritual success

As the referenced passage says:

> I know your deeds, that you are neither hot nor cold. Would that you were cold or hot. But as it is, since you are tepid, and neither hot nor cold, I am on the point of vomiting you out of my mouth. For you say [to yourself], "I am rich, and have become wealthy and have no need [of anything]!" But you do not realize that you are the one who is wretched and pitiful and poor and blind and naked. So my advice to you is to buy gold from Me that has been refined in the fire (so that you may become rich), and white clothing (so that you may be [properly] dressed and not have your shameful nakedness exposed), and medicinal salve to treat your eyes (so that you may see [the situation accurately]).  
> Revelation 3:15-18, translation from Ichthys

(Note: The seven churches of Revelation 2-3 and their relationship to the eras of Church history are covered in detail in [part 2A of The Coming Tribulation series](https://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2A.htm) on Ichthys).

#### Laodicea and the conflation of wealth and spiritual success

Material prosperity, even when it truly originates from God, is a far cry from true spiritual wealth, and can very easily induce a false sense of spiritual security.

As Christians, we need to take care to esteem the genuine "gold" our Lord and Master dispenses, that is, His Word of truth, and remember that excessive concentration on the ephemeral gold of this world to the detriment of the truth of the Word of God (upon which our relationship with Him is based) is both perilous and ultimately pointless.

The issue is all the more significant in our materially prosperous world here in the last days of the Church, for prosperity in the realm of material possessions (which are admittedly essential for human life) often has the undesirable side-effect of breeding spiritual complacency. Affluence, however, is not spirituality. And if success in the material realm should cause us to neglect our commitment to God and to His Word, it is well worth asking whether such prosperity has indeed been a blessing!
