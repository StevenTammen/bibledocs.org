#### The Introduction's title: Satan's rebellion and fall

The introduction section of our present study, though not dealing explicitly with the topic of Satan's rebellion and fall, nonetheless shares the title, as do several other introduction sections in the series.

This might seem a bit confusing inasmuch as the introduction here, as we shall see, is really more about a "then and now" comparing us to our ancient forebears (Adam and Eve) than Satan's rebellion and fall. While I certainly can't speak for the professor, here's my guess as to why: this is the wider context of the entire series... which is why it is called the Satanic Rebellion series!

Properly speaking, it is the first segment of the study ([Part 1](https://ichthys.com/SR1copy.htm)) that deals with Satan's initial state and his fall. However, reality today -- and indeed, as [Part 3](https://ichthys.com/Fall-sr3.htm) discusses, the very purpose and creation of man -- is very much shaped by and affected by Satan's continuing rebellion against God. If our existence is a war on a battlefield, then creation turned into this battlefield when Satan arrogantly raised his hand against his creator.

---

#### The Introduction's title: Satan's rebellion and fall

It is for this reason that we should keep this wider context in our minds as we start easing into our study. We are starting *in medias res* in this study, and likewise we are born into this world in the middle of a grand spiritual narrative that greatly transcends our own individual lives.

The beginning of this narrative -- which will end with Satan's complete and total defeat at the end of this present creation, and the establishment of a new, glorious universe where only righteousness and uprightness dwells, God with man and angel alike -- started that long time ago when Satan, once the preeminent angel, vainly thought in his mind to usurp God's place.

That was the opening act of all creature history. Parts 1 through 3 of this study get us from there to where we are now, and [Part 5](https://ichthys.com/Satans-Rebellion-Part5.htm) takes us even further by mapping out God's complete and perfect plan for history, including how the rest of history will proceed (at a high level). But this part of the study -- a detailed examination of how Satan exerts his control over the world -- is where the rubber hits the road for us as Christians: our present reality, grim as it may be.

We will periodically turn time and again to this wider context -- the echoes of Satan's initial rebellion and fall, the grand spiritual stage of existence -- as we proceed in our study, because keeping that big picture in mind is in fact one of the very best ways to see through the illusions before us in this world.

#### The actual introduction: Adam and Eve, and us

Well, we got all that from the title of the introductory section... but what of its content?

Dr. Luginbill opens up this present study with some initial framing points about Adam and Eve, their post-fall situation, and our situation. In particular:

- The contrast between pre-fall paradise and post-fall realities
- God's promise of deliverance
   - The prophecy of Genesis 3:15 (which was fulfilled upon the cross)
   - The *protoevangelium*
- Us now vs. them then

---

#### The contrast between pre-fall paradise and post-fall realities

- The world that Adam and Eve entered after their expulsion from the garden of Eden could not have been more different from the perfect environment they had so recently taken for granted.
   - Instead of abundant prosperity, ready at hand, they had entered a world of limitation, shortage and scarcity.
   - Instead of a world where all their needs were instantly provided for without any effort on their part, back-breaking toil was now necessary for survival.
- Our first parents would also now experience for the first time the full gamut of destructive and sinful emotions, including fear, jealousy and hostility.
- The domestic tranquility that had reigned in Eden as a matter of course would now be infected by anger, frustration, bitterness and resentment -- even to the point of murder (Cain and Abel).
- And finally, in crowning futility, when they had lived out their finite years, the ground would receive them back -- death would put an end to all they had worked and striven for in the sorrowful interim.

---

#### God's promise of deliverance

- But God did not leave them orphans on the earth, completely bereft of all hope and of Himself.
- In the same judgment that rendered our first parents mortal and subject to death, God also promised them the Seed who would one day crush the head of the serpent who had deceived them (Genesis 3:15).
- Christ's sacrifice was also foreshadowed in coats of skin with which He graciously clothed them (the *protoevangelium* = "first gospel"), replacing the garments born of their own efforts with symbols of the coming One who would one day die in their place.
- Thus before they even left the garden of Eden, God had given Adam and Eve a new tree of life to replace the one they had forsaken: that is, the cross of Jesus Christ (foreshadowed in the animal skins and in the prophecy of the Seed).
- It only remained for our first parents to accept our Lord's generous offer of boundless grace, trusting in Him for their deliverance from the inevitability of the grave, the unavoidable reality which had now become life's central issue.

---

#### Us now vs. them then

- From a spiritual point of view, life remains essentially the same for us today as it was when our first parents trekked out of Eden some six thousand years ago.
- The critical issue for every human being is identical now to what it was then: we must all choose whether or not to accept through faith God's solution to the problem of sin and death (in the person of His Son Jesus Christ).
- Moreover, just as Adam and Eve were left in the world beyond the point of faith, so also we today are not immediately transferred to our heavenly home after salvation, but remain here in the world to prove our faith, to grow in it, and to help others do the same.

##### The segue

Thus, as followers of God and believers in Jesus Christ, we can be forgiven for feeling ill at ease in this present world where we scarcely even seem to belong, for it is not a place where the knowledge of God abounds and the will of God is always done. On the contrary, this perilous world through which we pass lies largely under the influence of the evil one (1 John 5:19, and cf. Ephesians 2:2, which we talked about last time).

---

#### I. Strangers in the Devil's Realm

Now, we move into the first overarching section of the study: how we are strangers in this world of the devil's, persecuted as enemies.

This time, I'll mostly introduce the subsections, and we'll come back and hit them harder in coming weeks.

Here are the subsections we'll go over:

1. Sojourners in the devil's world
2. The vanity of life
3. The hostility of the world
4. The battlefield
5. The enemy

#### Sojourners in the devil's world

Like our first parents Adam and Eve before us, we have been left in this strange and alien world where the blinding reality of God is largely obscured from view, revealed almost exclusively in His Word to those who seek Him out. Until that time, we wait for something better as homeless wanderers in a world which finds our perspective and our hope worthless, even idiotic.

---

#### The vanity of life

In His judgment upon Adam and Eve, God laid down the fundamental calculus of human life outside of the garden: that we must earn our bread through sweat and toil throughout our short lives and afterwards return to dust (Genesis 3:16-19), taking nothing with us. 

---

#### The hostility of the world

From the moment we turn away from the hollow manner of life handed down from generation to generation (1 Peter 1:18), and turn instead to the living God through faith in His Son Jesus Christ, we are reconciled to Him, and at the same time alienated from the world. There can be no middle ground. Either we are friends of God, or friends of the world (James 4:4).

---

#### The battlefield

There is another dimension to be considered beyond our alienation to the world, beyond its essential futility, and beyond the enmity between it and us: the world is also a battlefield where the struggle between Satan's present kingdom and the coming kingdom of heaven continues to be played out in deadly earnest (as has been the case since the devil's fall).

---

#### The enemy

Having been evicted from the family of God and cast down to rule this kingdom of dust (but only for a short time, with an eternity in the lake of fire always being positionally imminent), of course Satan is going to be anything but friendly towards those of us who follow God. As we humans come to replace him and his followers in the family of God, it would in truth be quite strange if Satan did not pour out his wrath upon us, like a boxed-in animal raging against the end it knows is coming.

In fact, God soon will put down the beast forever, but in the meantime, we believers will face his wrath
