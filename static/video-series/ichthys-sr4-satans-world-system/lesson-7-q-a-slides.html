#### Does wealth *necessarily* make people complacent? Are rich people claiming to be serious Christians all lying?

This week in the lesson we argued against two false assumptions about wealth:

1. That affluence is *necessarily* a sign that God is blessing us for being spiritually advanced.
2. That the result of spiritual growth and a prosperous relationship with God is *necessarily* material wealth.

In this and our later discussion of the spiritual blindness characteristic of Laodicea, it may seem like we came down so hard against wealth that we ought to simply make a spiritual principle out of avoiding it. If wealth necessarily makes us complacent, then we'd be better of spiritually without it, right? But does it necessarily make us complacent?

---

#### Do we have positive examples of believers who were rich yet still advanced spiritually?

We did bring this up in the lesson, and the answer to this is yes.

Jesus faced a life of material hardship, as did all the Apostles, John the Baptist, Elijah, and many other believers besides. However, there are plenty of scriptural examples going the other way too. Many of the Patriarchs were wealthy (Abraham for example), David, and so on. Were these men foolish in their hearts in not giving up all their wealth?

After all, isn't that what Jesus said the rich young ruler needed to do to inherit eternal life (Matthew 19:16-23, Mark 10:17–22, Luke 18:18–23)?

---

#### Taken as a global absolute, the idea that everyone should sell all they have is complete rubbish

How many people nodded their heads just then? It's popular. It makes people feel holy. But the idea that this should be some general principle is complete rubbish.

People are incredibly hypocritical in this. It is easy to tell rich people -- people other than yourself -- that they are spiritually inferior if they don't give all their excess to the poor.

But Jesus doesn't tell the rich young ruler to go and give away his excess. No, he tells him to go and give away *all he had* (πάντα, Luke 18:22 in the Greek). If people think that Jesus' words here are globally prescriptive, then they actually need argue that *everyone* should go sell all they have and give to the poor. (Rather than just condemning "those rich people" for not giving away their excess).

---

#### So what does the passage involving the rich young ruler mean then?

So if this passage isn't a global exhortation for everyone to go sell all they have, what is it then?

Quite simply this man's wealth was, *for him specifically*, what was holding him back spiritually. And the end result shows why Jesus spoke as bluntly as he did. He didn't mince words. He told the young man exactly what he needed to do. *And the man wasn't willing*.

Jesus didn't lead him on, he told him what his impediment was, what was preventing him from following God as he should. And the man didn't want to hear it.

---

#### So what does the passage involving the rich young ruler mean then?

This interpretation makes ever so much more sense, and in fact is a lot scarier for those of us who aren't notably wealthy.

You see, if you make this passage only about wealth (rather than idolatry generally -- letting anything compete with God in our hearts), then those of us without grand means might get the mistaken idea that we're safe spiritually. That while it may be hard for the rich to inherit eternal life, it doesn't affect us since we aren't rich.

But while this young man's weakness was his attachment to his wealth, it doesn't truly matter what your weakness is. Your weakness could be alcohol. It could be women. Whatever it is, if you are not willing to give it up for God, then *you* are the rich young ruler of this passage. Even if wealth is in no way involved.

---

#### Who is "rich" anyway?

Around the world, there are believers in much worse shape than what even the most unfortunate in our affluent country must face. This is a fact.

Yet some people -- who are generally not themselves the poorest of the poor, and in fact usually far from it -- these people go and dictate to wealthy individuals what they "must" do (or look down on them spiritually if they don't). Somehow, these people don't consider for even a moment the possibility that they might themselves be rich compared to most of the rest of the world! Someone else has a bigger silver spoon, they say, so how can I be rich when those people have even more?

It's hypocrisy and legalism at their worst.

---

#### God works through the wealth and power that He gives believers in the Body of Christ

One of the clearest and most beautiful examples of this in scripture is the story of Joseph in Genesis. Having been sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers (because they were jealous of him), he comes to deliver his family from the great famine by means of the great wealth and influence he accrued as Pharaoh's right hand man.

That God was explicitly behind this is stated very clearly in Genesis 45:4-11.

---

#### God works through the wealth and power that He gives believers in the Body of Christ

The ministries of Jesus and the Apostles were also supported by the wealth of others. God providentially used these individuals to allow Jesus to do the work He was sent to do.

What's more, evidently a fair few of these individuals were not men (as one  might expect, especially given the time and cultural backdrop), but women. See Luke 8:1-3 (and also compare Jesus' relationship with Mary and Martha in John 11).

(Note: it would be an interpretive leap to assume that *only* women supported Jesus, but Luke 8:3 nonetheless says what it says. This is a great testament to the faith of these godly women of the past -- and clear evidence that God uses women in very important ways, just as men. Despite what some hateful parties claim to the contrary).

You might also compare Joseph of Arimathea.

---

#### So no, rich people who claim to be serious Christians aren't necessarily lying

I mentioned this in the lesson, but it bears repeating: wealth and spiritual growth are not causally linked with each other in any way, since God calls different people to different things.

Rich people have just as much a place in the plan of God as people without means. It all depends upon what God gives people and calls them to.

---

#### What about rich men, camels, and needles?

"Ah, but Steven you've been cherry-picking scripture in making your points. What about the statements of Jesus that follow the story of the rich young ruler?"

That would be, for example, Matthew 19:23-24:

> (23) And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. (24) And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."

---

#### What about rich men, camels, and needles?

So what gives?

You see, the thing is, none of the points I have made here are at all incompatible with the indisputable fact that wealth puts serious pressures on one's faith.

In fact, it takes very spiritually mature people to be able to handle wealth with the responsibility and dignity befitting our station as sons and daughters of God. Only those submitting themselves fully to the Lord have any hope of navigating the dangerous waters of wealth.

In fact, because of all this, wealthy people who keep the proper spiritual perspective are arguably more impressive in their witness as believers -- because they manage to keep their priorities straight even with so much greater temptation than the rest of us!

---

#### What about rich men, camels, and needles?

In line with the initial hypothetical accusations, things cut both ways. We must account for *all* the context:

> (25) When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished and said, “Then who can be saved?” (26) And looking at them, Jesus said to them, “With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

Wealthy Christians are saved because God gives them the strength and wisdom to deal with the pressures that come with wealth. In other words, it's Him not us, as always.

---

#### Is wealth really as dangerous as all that?

[In the Q&A video for lesson 5 of this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_sTQW8nPck&list=PLcqAebKsBWy-0I_RPPIU0S1jdywU7ZNw4&index=11&t=1381s) we already talked some about the perils of thinking that we'd somehow be different if we were wealthy -- that we we wouldn't engage in some of the problematic behavior that is often characteristic of the rich and powerful.

In that discussion, we spent some time talking about the corrupting influence of wealth and power (compare Lord Acton's "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupt absolutely"), and the temptations and pressures such things yield. So the answer is yes, wealth does pose great spiritual danger to us. There is no way around it.

---

#### On the other hand, poverty puts pressures on us too

The rich and powerful may have greater temptation to take bribes, bully people with their money, and so forth, but on the other hand, they are very seldom tempted to steal food for their family.

No matter where we find ourselves as Christians, we will need to exercise our free will every moment of every day, turning towards the Lord and submitting ourselves unto him. This never changes, whether we find ourselves with great wealth or with almost no wealth at all.

It's all about our free will and what we choose to do with it.
