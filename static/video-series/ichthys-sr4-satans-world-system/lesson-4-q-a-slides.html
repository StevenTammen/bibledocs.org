### Lesson 4 Q&A

#### Wait, is everything really pointless?

(Derived from https://ichthys.com/SR4(SWS).htm)

#### For us as believers, is all really vanity and futility?

At the end of the lesson I mentioned how it is important to keep in mind that the better part of Ecclesiastes is written from the unbelieving perspective: the perspective of the material world. However, we shouldn't go and get ourselves down and depressed about how unfair and uncertain the material world is... because our focus as Christians shouldn't be on the material world in the first place!

The unseen spiritual plane is what makes all the futility of the material world irrelevant. Romans 8:28 tells us God is working out all things together for good for those of us who love Him, so we have nothing to fear, no matter the darkness before us in life. In fact, even if this world takes our very life, we will then only have the eternal rewards relating to the exceptional witness of martyrdom to look forward to and enjoy forever.

For us then, much of the futility we are discussing here should be mostly academic in nature. *Our* lives as believers aren't meaningless because we are part of the Body of Christ -- members of a community around the world following the Will of God -- and our works in relation to God's will for us will be rewarded in eternity. Everything thing we do, even down  to the very smallest choice, is therefore important.

#### Wait, why spend time teaching on the futility of the material world then, if you said it is mostly academic for us Christians?

Well, because quite simply, it ceases to be academic the second we focus on the world to even the smallest degree.

Applied properly, Ecclesiastes is an excellent motivator in terms of us avoiding involvement with the world. If the material world and all it values are corrupted by vanity and futility (and unavoidably so), then the logical response is to focus on the better things: the spiritual things with eternal weight behind them, the things that are most decided *not* stained by existential pointlessness.

But we humans have short attention spans and weak discipline and often forget these important truths. Perhaps we have also never really considered these truths to begin with. This is why teaching these things and repeatedly circling back to them is always a good thing. Because while the futility of the material world is of little importance to us when we float above it all on the high road to Zion, we only cling to that high road some less-than-complete percentage of our lives here. The rest of the time, the teaching on the world's essentially vanity (despite all its much noise and bravado) is a welcome reminder for us to keep our priorities where they should be.

#### For unbelievers, is all really vanity and futility?

This is actually a somewhat nuanced question to answer. Yes and no?

From the primary perspective of Ecclesiastes -- which focuses strictly on the material world as if that were all there is -- then yes. That is the whole point of our discussion: if this is all there  is, well since so much in the world is rendered futile by circumstances outside of human control, everything is laced with pointlessness. For example:

- The diligent and hard-working may lose their hard-earned property due to circumstances out of their control (disaster, war, etc.), while the lazy and indolent may stumble into great wealth and easy times.
- Success and recognition may go to the leeches of society rather than those whose conduct actually merits the *stephanos* crown of a meritorious victor.
- A great man may leave his entire estate to his good-for-nothing heirs, or even the children of another.

#### For unbelievers, is all really vanity and futility?

However, this world is *not* all there is, as we have repeatedly emphasized for us as Christians. For us, this is a great source of comfort.

For the unbeliever, however, this is (or rather, should be, were they ever to stop and think about things) a matter of great fear. God is coming back to judge the living and the dead. And all who have spit in God's face and rejected God's sacrifice of His Son on their behalf will stand before Him on that Day of Days with no excuse and no blood-price covering their iniquity. Then they will be rightly and justly condemned, facing an eternity apart from God, as they have chosen in their hearts.

Only in this world will people have the chance to make choices to determine their eternal status. In this way, while the material world upon which unbelievers focus is indeed full of vanity and futility, the lives of unbelievers are not completely void of meaning. Daily they choose to repress the truth in their hearts that could save them from standing before a perfect and just God as a sinful being. All they have to do is not say no.

Life for unbelievers thus has meaning too, even eternal meaning. But it is an unfolding tragedy rather than a blessed and joyful opportunity to win eternal rewards.
