### Lesson 2 Questions and Answers

---

#### Why should we really care about the wider context of the battle between God and Satan (and in particular, Satan's continuing rebellion) if it is above our pay grade anyway?

We spent a good bit of time this lesson going over how it is useful for us to keep the wider context of this life in mind -- the invisible yet very real battle between God and Satan, the battle for spiritual truth in this world, fought in the hearts and minds of men. If what we went over wasn't enough justification to convince you that this general practice is prudent, consider the question of the existential purpose of man.

In catechisms and such, you may see things phrased in the following way:

> What is the purpose of man and his life?

> The purpose of man and his life is to bring glory to God.

While this is not really wrong, it is a bit unsatisfying. After all, the angels can bring glory to God too. What is special about man, that God saw fit to take on human vesture and tie himself to us for all eternity? Why did God create human beings? What is our place in the plan of God?

#### Why should we really care about the wider context of the battle between God and Satan (and in particular, Satan's continuing rebellion) if it is above our pay grade anyway?

As a kid, I was always displeased with the vagueness with which people danced around our fundamental existential purpose as humans. Perhaps it's just because I'm young, I thought. Maybe they'll tell me when I'm older.

Then I got older and most people -- even teachers whom I pressed -- were still very vague. I found it most vexing. God doesn't just do things for no reason. He is the Divine λόγος, the embodiment of all Reason and Order in the universe. Of course He has good reasons for doing things! So why couldn't anyone tell me?

In large part, the reason why I never found satisfaction is because so few people nowadays teach on the parts of the Bible dealing with the *really* big picture. Modern Christianity tends to mostly sweep Revelation under the rug and scorn those who take strong positions on eschatology. The same is true for those taking strong positions on matters relating to angels and all history preceding man. We weren't there, they say, so why is it our business? The Bible "doesn't contain enough to go on" (in their opinion). You don't want to be like those wacky teachers shouting from the street corners that the end is near, do you?

#### Why should we really care about the wider context of the battle between God and Satan (and in particular, Satan's continuing rebellion) if it is above our pay grade anyway?

The problem is, in forgoing these topics, they rob human existence of its context, and make it impossible to contextualize why we are here. [Part 3](https://ichthys.com/Fall-sr3.htm) of the study goes into all of this in much more detail, but I am bringing all of this up now because it is my belief that the fundamental existential questions for humanity *cannot be satisfactorily answered unless and until you explain Satan's rebellion against God*. We humans have a very defined purpose and reason for existing, and it is inseparably tied to proving to all that Satan's actions in truth have no standing behind them. When he is thrown into the lake of fire at the end of this creation, broken and imperfect man -- now ascended with perfect resurrection bodies to take our place next to our Older Brother -- will be there to judge the angels (1 Corinthians 6:3), living proof that there is no contradiction between God's mercy and His Justice.

*This* is why we talk about Satan's rebellion and fall, as well as where history is headed in the final reckoning of things. Wondering why things don't make sense when failing to teach on these things is like complaining that a movie is confusing when you only watch the middle 20 minutes of it.

#### Was the world after Adam and Eve fell really already in Satan's hands?

In the lesson earlier this week, we argued that when our ancient parents were expelled from paradise, they suddenly found themselves as strangers and aliens in this world that no longer belonged to them. But was the world already in Satan's hands at this point, like it most assuredly is today?

Once sin entered the world, so did spiritual separation from God. Prior to the fall, Satan had no foothold in this new creation. Man and God were in perfect communion with each other. However, once man disobeyed and thereby brought sin and spiritual death into the world, the perfect fellowship was shattered. Like the fallen angels, fallen man was no longer in communion with their perfect creator.

However, unlike the fallen angels, Adam and Eve submitted themselves to God's authority (even in their sinfulness). They may have messed up in a spectacular way, but they still chose to wait on God's promise of eventual redemption.

This is why, with sin the world, Satan may have thought he'd won a great victory -- and the world most certainly became a hostile place for us as believers -- but he did not completely sever the relationship between Adam and Eve (humanity generally) and God. In this way, we live as strangers and foreigners in his present kingdom, but our ultimate home lies with God and the kingdom to come.

#### Why open with the example of Adam and Eve?

It is a very popular modern sentiment to think that we humans have somehow advanced greatly over the centuries and millennia, as if we are very advanced and sophisticated nowadays. One excellent reason for starting here is because it puts this mistaken view in sharp spiritual relief.

In truth, we are in exactly the same spiritual boat as Adam and Eve some 6,000 years ago. Nothing of major spiritual import has changed. We are still broken and sinful, we still face unavoidable death, and we will still come face to face with a perfect God on the other side, a God whose perfect Justice does not allow for sin to be ignored in the slightest.

As a tool for framing our spiritual situation in this fallen world then, why not start from the beginning, from the point when humanity first faced the toil and futility of spiritual separation from God?

We may try to comfort ourselves by saying we in the Church have progressed thus and so since then -- and we do have the Holy Spirit now, it is true -- but ultimately, the mechanics of reality are exactly the same now as then. We ought never forget this.

As a further practical note, it is perhaps easiest to see the harsh truth of our present situation when it is examined side-by-side with Eden.

#### Why did God lay the burdens he did upon mankind?

Have you ever wondered why God cursed the ground such that man would have to break his back for his food, and why he sends pain upon women in childbirth?

> "After all was said and done, Adam and Eve believed and trusted you, right? Do you really need to burden us so? We get the point already God. Sheesh."

When we think along these lines we get perilously close to acting as clay talking back in the hands of the potter. In fact, God does all he does in perfect wisdom for the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28).

People always want a reason for things. Well, in this case, here's one: have you ever considered that suffering is a blessing for us in that it drives us to grope for and find God? If we were all prosperous and content in the world, would we really find it necessary to find our faith in this life?

While suffering may look like a hugely negative thing in the here and now, in truth, it is an act of kindness. This sort of thought process makes unbelievers view us as stark raving mad, but it is the truth. If God needs to knock us upside the head to get our focus off of the siren song of the world, then that is actually better for us in the eternal reckoning of things.
