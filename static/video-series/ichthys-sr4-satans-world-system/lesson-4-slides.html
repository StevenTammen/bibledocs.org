#### Introduction: thorns and thistles, and then death

In His judgment upon Adam and Eve, God laid down the fundamental calculus of human life outside of the garden: that we must earn our bread through sweat and toil throughout our short lives and afterwards return to dust (Genesis 3:16-19).

The curse of a life filled with difficulties followed by an inevitable death will only be removed when God has brought history itself to an end (Revelation 22:3). In the meantime, the cycle of painful birth, thistles and thorns, and then a return to the ground from whence we were originally taken is destined to repeat for us, one and all.

> "Utter futility! Utter futility!" says the teacher, "Everything is futility!"
>
> Ecclesiastes 1:2, translation from Ichthys

#### Achievement is not really within the power of man to control

Many people strive for things that cannot be achieved, for even with prodigious effort, achievement is not really within the power of man to control:

> The race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise, or wealth to the brilliant, or favor to the learned, but time and chance happen to them all.
>
> Ecclesiastes 9:11, NIV

Who can control what happens to them? Though a man may toil and strive all the days of his life, he may still watch the desires of his heart go to another. What then was his effort, all that he strived after?

---

#### Even if you do happen to gain something, nothing in this life is at all secure. All you have can be lost in the blink of an eye

Of those who do achieve what they have set their hopes on, many of them will lose what they have striven for, since everything in this life is ephemeral (cf. Isaiah 40:6-8; Matthew 6:19-21; Luke 12:14-21, 12:33; James 1:10-11, 5:2-3; 1 Peter 1:24; 2 Peter 3:10-13; 1 John 2:15-17):

> Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.
>
> Ecclesiastes 9:12, NIV

---

#### Contrast the total security of the eternal rewards that we earn as Christians

It is with these realities in view that our Lord commanded us to look beyond the hollow rewards of this life to the true rewards, eternal in the heavens, which come from God:

> Don't stock up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and corrosion eat them away and where thieves dig through and steal them. But stock up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor corrosion eat them away and where thieves neither dig through nor steal them. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
>
> Matthew 6:19-21, translation from Ichthys

---

#### If you do manage to gain something and even manage to hold onto it, death will still make a mockery of you

Finally, even of those who do manage to retain what they have striven for all the days of their lives, death will ultimately bereave them of all their precious accomplishments. For death, in particular, makes a mockery of all human achievement:

> What profit will a man have if he gains the whole world but loses his life?
>
> Matthew 16:26, translation from Ichthys

Since the ultimate loss of life is the common heritage of all mankind, unless some solution can be found to the overarching problem of our physical mortality, even achievement on a level unsurpassed in human history is essentially meaningless. Indeed, one may even make the argument that the greater the achievement, the greater the futility, on account of the correspondingly greater loss involved at death. Along with life, the poor lose only their poverty in death, but the rich, successful person loses the things esteemed most in this world. Death thus renders all secular achievements essentially pointless:

> Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases; for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him.
>
> Psalm 49:16-17, NIV

---

#### If you do manage to gain something and even manage to hold onto it, death will still make a mockery of you

Nothing we do is truly original (Ecclesiastes 1:10). Nothing we do will ultimately be remembered (Ecclesiastes 1:11). Despite all our efforts, death will snatch away from us all we have gained in this life "though we had named lands after ourselves" (Psalm 49:11b), and we will be oblivious to the fate of our prized possessions after our departure (Ecclesiastes 2:17-21).

In this way, despite all the boastful arrogance of man, we are not able to secure a single thing against death, nor can we control the timing of when it comes to claim us. In this way, nothing is truly secure, and nothing is forever.

#### If you do manage to gain something and even manage to hold onto it, death will still make a mockery of you

Even the idea of immortal fame -- glory sung by the bards forevermore -- is ultimately only a poor simulacrum of true immortality.

> [410] For my mother the goddess, silver-footed Thetis, telleth me that twofold fates are bearing me toward the doom of death: if I abide here and war about the city of the Trojans, then lost is my home-return, **but my renown shall be imperishable**; but if I return home to my dear native land, [415] lost then is my glorious renown, yet shall my life long endure, neither shall the doom of death come soon upon me.
>
> [*Iliad* IX.410ff.](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D374)

The Homeric warrior my think that his glory, his κλέος, will make him immortal, but truly, does he really live on? While his body is eaten by worms, memory of him will fade. By the time of his grandchildren, his actual identity will be lost.

What immortality is this? Is this what people strive for all the days of their life?

> "Utter futility! Utter futility!" says the teacher, "Everything is futility!"

#### For anyone being honest with themselves, we don't even have to be as rigorous as we are being here, for life is self-evidently pointless

This progression of points we've gone through here is a precise logical accounting of life's ultimate futility, but you don't even have to go to such great lengths to get honest people to see life's true nature.

This is because the essential vanity of human effort and the ephemeral nature of life is difficult to ignore or deny (for anyone being objective; cf. Isaiah 40:6; Luke 12:14-21, 12:33; James 1:10-11, 5:2; 1 Peter 1:24; 2 Peter 3:10-13):

> Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it.
>
> Psalm 39:6, NIV

---

#### All of this is why true meaning must come external to this physical world

Any time an atheist tells you that they think life has meaning, you should ask them how they reckon so, given that they only believe in this present material world where:

- All outcomes in life are completely out of our control as humans.
- No one can completely secure even the smallest thing in life, protecting it from loss, theft, degradation, and the like. Even if someone manages to obtain the outcome they want, it can get wiped away in the blink of an eye.
- Even those few who live all their lives with everything the world has to offer (power, fame, wealth, and so on) will take nothing with them to the grave. In a few short years, they will lose all they hold dear, everything they strived for will pass on to others (even if said others are in no way worthy), and no one will remember their true character.

---

#### All of this is why true meaning must come external to this physical world

If there is actually no eternal spiritual dimension behind our existence, then this life is horrifically depressing, made all the more so by the fact that we humans continually attempt to convince ourselves of its great importance. While in truth we are snuffed out like a candle in the great void, many people fancy themselves kings and queens of their own destiny, even as they are cut down by its decrees.

We are most fortunate as Christians to have been given the opportunity to sidestep all this futility in the world, keeping our eyes fixed on the eternal. If we ever forget that these eternal matters are the only ones that truly matter -- if we ever temporarily buy into the world's skin-deep veneer -- let us call back to mind today's discussion regarding the true nature of this present material existence.
