### Lesson 9: For unbelievers, rejecting God leads to a void that must be filled

#### Rejecting God leads to a void that must be filled. This is why unbelievers elevate in importance their pursuits in the material world as they do

Having rejected God (and often even having denied His existence), the unbeliever is forced to place an incorrect emphasis and inordinate importance on this present world. Such blindness, such self-delusion, such suppression of the truth about God necessarily elevates the world and its present ruler into the realm of "god" in the unbeliever's eyes.

The throne in the heart of every man is never empty for long.

#### Rejecting God leads to a void that must be filled. This is why unbelievers elevate in importance their pursuits in the material world as they do

Some scripture on the topic:

> God's wrath is about to be revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness -- on men who suppress the truth [about God] in their unrighteousness. For that which can be known about God [from everyday experience] is obvious to them, because God has made it obvious. His nature, though invisible, is nevertheless plainly apparent, and has been since His foundation of the world, for it may be clearly inferred from this creation of His -- [this is true of] both His eternal power and His divinity -- so that they are without any excuse: they knew about God, but they neither honored Him as God nor thanked Him. Instead, they gave themselves over to [the] vanity [of this world] in their speculations, and their senseless hearts were filled with darkness. Claiming to be wise, they became foolish, for they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for images and likenesses of corruptible men, of birds and beasts and reptiles.  
> Romans 1:18-23, translation from Ichthys

#### Rejecting God leads to a void that must be filled. This is why unbelievers elevate in importance their pursuits in the material world as they do

This is the point at which spiritual degeneration begins for the unbeliever.

As this passage makes plain, everyone comes to appreciate the existence of their Creator, in most cases early in life; the fact that the majority of people in the history of the world have gone on to reject Him, replace Him in their thinking with other objects, and deny His existence altogether, does not change the truth of this principle.

Once God has been rejected, some substitute will of necessity be accepted in place of the ultimate truth (2 Peter 2:21-22; compareÂ Matthew 7:6).

#### It is important for Christians to understand this truth to help us better avoid ending up on the destructive path

This process of substituting worldly concerns for God is the inevitable path of unbelief. And it is important for Christians to have no illusions in this regard, lest we share in any way in the downward spiral that comes from choosing the vanity of this world over our relationship with God in Christ:

> So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you no longer live as the gentiles do in futility of mind, darkened in thought and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity [to God's truth], they have given themselves over to sensuality to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.  
> Ephesians 4:17-19, translation from Ichthys

---

#### The substitute that most readily tries fills the void is the pursuit of happiness

Hardness, blindness and self-delusion are inevitable results of rejecting truth and turning away from God. (For more on the principle of the hardening of the unbeliever's heart, see Part 2 of Ichthys' series on Exodus 14: [Hardening Pharaoh's Heart](https://ichthys.com/e2.htm)).

Using this to his advantage, the "god of this world" thus blinds the minds of unbelievers (2 Corinthians 4:4), such that the proper quest for God is replaced instead by a never-ending quest for happiness. We have it from Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived (apart from our Lord) that no avenue of human activity, no amount of success or accumulation of wealth, can ever actually bring true happiness, for all such "chasing after the wind" is ultimately pointless (Ecclesiastes chapters 1-2).

Nevertheless, unbelievers pursue happiness with all the zeal they can muster, channeling their time and energy here instead of focusing on the proper spiritual ends to which they should aspire. This is the substitution effect that has been the focus of today's lesson.

We will examine the unbeliever's ultimately futile quest for happiness in more depth next time.
