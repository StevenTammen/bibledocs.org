### Lesson 5: The futility problem is not solved in modern times; human desire is insatiable

#### This world is not anything like the garden of Eden

The idea that the world is a wonderful place, filled with all sorts of delights which we have been put here expressly for the purpose of enjoying, is decidedly un-Christian. This is *not* the garden of Eden, but rather the devil's world (at present), and we need to order our perspective and our priorities accordingly.

We will go through much in the next few weeks, but this principle should always be in the back of our minds: that we are but sojourners in hostile territory, strangers in a foreign land. As long as we remember this and keep our eyes on the spiritual dimension, we need not be concerned by the great vanity and futility that plagues this world under the sun, because with our gaze fixed above (on things that truly do matter), our lives will not be stained by the same vanity and futility, but will instead be shot through with eternal meaning.

#### In tragic irony, the futility shines through all the more in our day, wherein people feel like humanity has made so much progress

For example, people might think that the elimination of large-scale war, many diseases, widespread starvation, and so on would lead to less futility and human hopelessness than in other periods.

However, at no time in history has the true futility of life been more clearly perspicuous than in our modern world of technology, affluence and leisure time, where the phenomena of apathy, depression, and suicide are all in the process of increasing exponentially.

That modern advances (which are supposed to be a blessing to human life) are found to be correlated instead with reactions of hopelessness may seem contradictory from the secular viewpoint. From the Biblical viewpoint, however, the correlation seems perfectly reasonable. Apart from God, life ***is*** hopeless; therefore to the degree that mankind is relieved of the daily necessities (which for most of history have occupied human existence), one should expect this hopelessness to shine through with ever greater clarity.

What is surprising from the Biblical point of view is that this pall of futility does not hang even heavier over the unbelieving world (a phenomenon to be attributed to the spiritual blindness which sets in once God is rejected).

#### In tragic irony, the futility shines through all the more in our day, wherein people feel like humanity has made so much progress

Most of the points we will be making in discussing the vanity of the the world apply equally throughout all times and places (rather than just being phenomena of today). However, the reason why I am emphasizing this particular point upfront is to immediately squash the modern impulse to look down upon past peoples and draw some sort of categorical distinction between us and them, with the conclusion being that we've graduated past the problems that affected them.

No we haven't. Not at all.

In fact, we are worse off in most spiritually important ways. For example, many people throughout history could not read, yet still managed to grow in faith despite this massive handicap. But now that we have very high literacy in the developed world, many people have decided that they don't need God. We have God's truth more accessible to us than ever before (particularly since the advent of the internet), yet people know less of it on average than their illiterate ancestors.

As has ever been the case, the world is not futile because people struggle under poverty or illiteracy or any other material burden, but because human life lived aside from the truth is tragically hopeless and vain. And that trend has been getting worse, not better.

#### The insatiability of human desire: only the unattained and the unattainable are truly attractive

Life, when contrasted with the perfect environment of Eden, is a terribly frustrating experience.

There is no truly compelling purpose for all the effort that goes on under the sun. All Man's labors are ultimately to put food in his mouth, but that mouth can never be filled nor its appetite satisfied (Ecclesiastes 6:7). Whatever men strive for, enduring toil and pain, will not satisfy -- only the unattained and the unattainable are truly attractive. And even they turn to dust before the eyes if the gaze is prolonged but a moment.

If money is the object of desire, there will never be enough of it; if wealth is the objective, there is never enough to satisfy (Ecclesiastes 5:10). If you hoard wealth, it is useless to you; if you spend it for your enjoyment, you no longer possess it (Ecclesiastes 5:11). And if through toil and pain and effort wealth is achieved, it vexes the sleep of the rich, while the laborer sleeps sweetly after a simple meal (Ecclesiastes 5:12).

Toil and pain and effort -- the new calculus of life after Eden demands it. Without such sweat and labor we would not eat. But no matter how long and hard and successful the work, it cannot ward off death forever, nor can it even provide lasting satisfaction.

#### The insatiability of human desire: only the unattained and the unattainable are truly attractive

No matter what is pursued in this life -- no matter how perfect and worthy it may seem up on the pedestal you put it on in your heart, according to your idealized image of it -- it will lose its shine once it is in your hands.

The possessions you worked so hard to accumulate, the woman you worked so hard to win over, the promotion you toiled day and night to obtain, the fame and attention you jealously sought -- none of these things mean nearly so much once they are actually within your grasp. Instead of gratitude and satisfaction for blessings already realized, the human heart ever desires more.

And thus it is that humans run to and fro in futility, stuck on a hamster wheel of seeking the next thing that will certainly satisfy, only to pull an astonishing game of selective memory when each and every time, what was so furiously pursued turns out to not be all that after all.

Viewed by an outside party, this constantly repeating cycle is obviously quite insane. According to some, the very definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while yet expecting a different result. And yet who among mankind can claim that they are immune? That they have never fallen for the greener grass?

#### The insatiability of human desire: only the unattained and the unattainable are truly attractive

There is no solution to this flaw in human desire within the material world. Nothing can truly satisfy, since what was once desired will always be replaced with something different -- something even bigger and grander.

The only way to escape the madness is to seek after that which can truly satisfy: spiritual truth, the water of the Word (John 4:14).

But, as we shall see, mankind, encouraged heavily by Satan and the systems Satan sets in place in this fallen world, ultimately tries to distract itself from this inconvenient truth rather than accepting the solution God offers, for doing such would require acknowledgment of and obedience to God. In the eyes of many, that is a price too steep to pay.
