#### Satan is not picky with how he distracts Man. He is behind both sides of most extremes... making the pointlessness of much human disagreement all the more lamentable

One of the ideas that I brought up in the lesson was the idea that Satan is not picky in how he leads Man astray. He will do whatever he can, even supporting two sides that are diametrically opposed to each other... as long as both sides are opposed to God's truth.

Thus it is that both sides in politics are largely driven by Satan's agenda. The surface level disagreements that people fight to the death over in politics in truth are of no spiritual import whatsoever. But *all* sides in politics look to the material world for answers to problems that are spiritual in nature, and in this they are all ultimately opposed to the perspective we should hold onto as Christians.

This point will no doubt draw the ire of some parties that believe that Christians are supposed to be very politically active and vote in the Kingdom in the here and now. The problem is that this is the devil's world, and all the political, social, and even financial systems across the entire world are within his sphere of influence. Political involvement for us as Christians is thus nothing more than sharing a dance with the enemy. Is it possible to navigate such involvement without negative repercussions? Perhaps -- although history and statistics say otherwise. But what is more likely instead is that you end up with a knife in your back. (Spiritually speaking).

#### Satan is not picky with how he distracts Man. He is behind both sides of most extremes... making the pointlessness of much human disagreement all the more lamentable

This observation of Satan being behind all sides (other than the true side) is not limited to politics, although I brought politics up first because many people do not recognize that Satan's influence here is as widespread as it truly is (for example, some people think it is only the other political party that is playing into Satan's hands, with their own being Simon pure. In reality, Satan is behind basically all political movements, which all have a tendency to put the focus on the material and distract Christians from the actual spiritual reasons why we are here in this world). One other area that immediately comes to mind is the two extremes when it comes to pleasure.

On the one hand you have hedonists who give into their lusts and leave no urge unexplored. In pursuit of pleasure, they hold themselves to no standards of behavior.

On the other hand, you have people who strictly practice asceticism. The problems may not be quite so obvious with this sort, but the second we Christians start making rules the Bible doesn't, we have fallen into legalism, which will tend to make us look down on others in arrogance while not recognizing our own need for a savior each and every day.

These two paths could not be more different from each other... on the surface. But in truth, they are identical in the only way that truly matters: they are both dangerous false ideas that oppose God's truth. And Satan is the author of both. He doesn't care which one gets us, nor does he actually himself care whether we live completely unrestrained lives, or lives of too much asceticism to the point of legalism. All he cares is that people who follow either path are not following the path that God wants them too.

#### Satan is not picky with how he distracts Man. He is behind both sides of most extremes... making the pointlessness of much human disagreement all the more lamentable

The point in us bringing all of this up is to remind us that life is black and white. There is God's way of doing things (which is correct), and then there is everything else, which is necessary in opposition to God (compare Matthew 12:30). And behind "everything else" lies Satan.

Everything in life that is outside of God's Will for us is empowered by Satan and set on fire by hell. Ultimately, for all its sound and fury, life is nothing more than a loud, crude display, a production of low value that doesn't hold up under even the slightest scrutiny. We let ourselves get distracted by the noisy bad acting to our own peril. For while the ridiculous song and dance goes on before us as a distraction, Satan is busy ransacking the manor, as it were.

It is tragic folly to sit transfixed by Satan's sham, to buy into the nonsense. Satan may put lipstick on the pig and put it in a dress, but all life apart from God is nonetheless doomed to squalor and unseemliness. Calling it pretty is the greatest foolishness.

#### More on the bondage caused by fear of loss

In the lesson, I also talked about how one of the ways that Satan gets his claws in us is by stoking and manipulating Man's fear of losing wealth, comfort, and security.

It's a ridiculous notion to think that anything we own in this life is "ours". We are but unworthy servants who have been put in charge of some things by our Master. Any view other than this is heresy.

Why then should we fear material loss? We should certainly be good stewards of all that God puts under our control, but if it gets taken away according to the Master's will, well what is it to us? It wasn't ours to begin with. We should instead react how Job reacted (initially, at least): "Naked I came from my motherâ€™s womb, and naked I will return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD" (Job 1:21).

#### More on the bondage caused by fear of loss

I say all this to make that point that it is fundamentally insane to try to become captain of your own ship, master of your own house. When compared to God -- not just your creator and sustainer, but the  creator and sustainer of the entire universe (compare Colossians 1:17) -- you are less than an ant. Can the pot talk back to the potter and express dissatisfaction with the direction of things? So what gives humanity the breathtaking arrogance to demand that God do thus and so for us, to bargain with Him as if were were His equal? 

This is why pouting when God calls us to go do His work -- even if it is hard and difficult and involves the loss of what worldlings esteem -- is actually very foolish. God is perfect and never orders us to do anything we can't handle (1 Corinthians 10:13). He knows what He is doing.

#### More on the bondage caused by fear of loss

We Christians don't believe in fate, but we do believe in the inexorable Plan of God. Like the example of Jonah shows, we should know that running away from God doesn't work. We can't escape the destiny he has in store for us (compare Revelation 13:10).

And if we don't like this now, then what about when God calls the Church to give witness in martyrdom during the dark days of the tribulation? He will be using our blood to send a very strong message. But we won't have the courage to serve him in this way if we are too busy sulking about the loss of our toys like petulant children -- and we will lose much more than our toys in those days.

Satan will at that time make great use of the fear of loss to drive people away from God, which is why it is an important thing for us to learn how to avoid in the present. As sojourners in this life, growing overly attached to material things just makes us easy for the enemy to manipulate, and that is why it is something we should learn to guard against.
