### Question: Doesn't it seem like we get kind of a raw deal as Christians?

---

#### Appearances can be deceiving

A common trope in fairy tales is the deceptiveness of external appearances. That which may appear ugly and deformed may in fact hide untold beauty, and that which appears flawless may in fact conceal great grotesqueness.

(Not that we should necessarily be looking to manifestations of culture for our theology, but it is a decent parallel).

---

#### Perspective is everything

Let me present two sets of facts, both 100% true. The danger in these things is not their falseness, but the fact that presenting one side without the other leads to great misunderstanding, and warped expectations.

Think two sides of a road, both leading to a ditch.

---

#### Christians: Suffering and hardship

One set of facts:

- The Bible says we will suffer just how Christ suffered. A call to pick up our crosses is no invitation to a picnic.
- The world will persecute us. We may be jailed, beaten, and even put to death due simply to being Christians.
- As Christians, we will inherently suffer more than unbelievers.
- On top of that, the more serious you get as a Christian and the more you grow spiritually, the more hardship you will face. (In order to grow your faith).

Thus, objectively speaking, if you become a Christian, and you get serious as a Christian, you will face more difficult material circumstances than if you did not.

(While I would not necessarily advise you start here in evangelism, we should nonetheless be upfront about what people are signing up for).

---

#### Christians: Heaven and eternal rewards

Another set of facts:

- We will rise with immortal bodies on that great Day of Days, never to face pain or suffering ever again.
- Every tear will be wiped away, and we will spend eternity in perfect fellowship with God, the angels, and each other.
- We will live forever in paradise, tasting of glories we are not even given to know at present.
- God will reward us out of measure for each and every sacrifice we made for the Kingdom of God in our short time here on Earth. The rewards we earn will be glorious beyond our imagination, eternal, and will never fade in the least.

Note the eternal nature of all these things.

#### What appears to be a bad bargain is in fact infinite gain

With our faces down here in the dirt, it is easy to see what we give up. We can feel it every day. Heaven and eternity... those seem rather far away. Like things that are no more than abstract concepts or ideas to us, something theoretical.

But our pain is real *today*, our suffering before us *now*.

And thus it is that it is ever so much easier for us to see all the cost that is right before us and none of the benefit that is just a promise at present. Like a child unable to delay gratification for something even better, we humans quickly lose sight of all the things that make the sacrifice worth it.

---

#### What appears to be a bad bargain is in fact infinite gain

Nevertheless, consider for a moment how wild it is that if we go through a *finite* period of difficulty, God gives us *eternal* rewards (on top of our already glorious inheritance as believers, sons and daughters of God).

Perhaps a physical analogy will help. If someone told you you had to wash their car and they'd give you a million dollars, you would jump at the chance, right? Not because you particularly want to go out into the hot sun and wash the car, but because you'd understand that no matter what it took, no matter how unpleasant you might be for a short time, you would get rewarded for your efforts to a ridiculously high degree, and it would be more than worth it.

Why is that easy for us to grasp, but not the significance of the eternal gain that God promises?

---

#### That was ugly to beautiful. How about beautiful to ugly?

We have just briefly discussed the deceptive appearances of the state that believers find themselves in. How about the state of unbelievers?

---

#### Unbelievers: Material lives without special suffering, beloved of the world

One set of facts:

- Unbelievers do not come in for any special suffering. Like believers, they face general human suffering (such as disease and natural disaster), but they have nothing on top of that.
- Because they are children of this world, Satan's system of control nearly always rewards them for behavior in opposition to God. The world gives them good things rather than the bad things it gives us.
- They can live their lives sating every lust they posses, be it for money, power, women, or whatever else. They do not have any rules or regulations limiting their pursuit of pleasure. And when doing something forbidden to us, they never feel a pang of conscience like we might if we were to do the same things. They can enjoy it all, and then go to bed without internal conflict or shame. Just like the animals.

---

#### Unbelievers: An eternal future in darkness apart from God

Another set of facts:

- Unbelievers will face, by their own choice, an eternity apart from God. Since God is everything good and true and right, being eternally separated from Him will be a most terrible fate indeed. At that time, there will be no more opportunity to change their fates. God gave them their chance, and they spit in His face instead.
- Nothing they did in this material world will last. The grave will rob them of everything, and what comes after that for them -- for all eternity -- is darkness.
- It is the very fact that God doesn't pull on the strings of their consciences that lets unbelievers happily live their whole lives without becoming aware of the terrible fate that is positionally right before them. In other words, it is their very lack of suffering and hardship that breeds the arrogance that lets them reject God. The very thing that seems so desirable in fact is what leads to their eternal downfall.
